<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Do you have pictures of either of them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: I have pictures of Meir as a baby.</sentence><sentence id="47">No, actually as an adult, too.</sentence><sentence id="48">Come to think of it, yes, there is a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults.</sentence><sentence id="49">One from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and one I'm not sure where from.</sentence><sentence id="50">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pisa</span> and studied medicine and then he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">I think he married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> but I don't think he had children.</sentence><sentence id="52">And I don't know what happened to his wife.</sentence><sentence id="53">I don't know if she was deported or not deported.</sentence><sentence id="54">My father never tried to look her up after the war.</sentence><sentence id="55">And my mother, after my father's death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir's wife wasn't Jewish and that's why my father hadn't bothered to look her up after the war because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> for two and a half years after the war, he could have.</sentence><sentence id="56">And he knew his brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother's wife but he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="58">That may mean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="59">Anyway Meir's experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education.</sentence><sentence id="60">And it's also true that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious.</sentence><sentence id="61">As an adult in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I don't mean in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war, that's something else.</sentence><sentence id="62">But as an adult in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not as religious as he had been growing up.</sentence><sentence id="63">He had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, he sent his kids to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span>, he was very Jewish, but that was normal in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">People did that.</sentence><sentence id="65">But he was not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained religious.</sentence><sentence id="66">And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren't.</sentence><sentence id="67">I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="68">That would be a nice question to ask.</sentence><sentence id="69">My cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would know all these answers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was religious and who was not.</sentence><sentence id="70">Anyway what else can I say about just his family background.</sentence><sentence id="71">His mother had this <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">I think several of his brothers were involved in running the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or in, as I said, selling to the peasants.</sentence><sentence id="73">But some of the brothers moved.</sentence><sentence id="74">He himself moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">I think another brother, Simcha moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">I'm not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up.</sentence><sentence id="77">I mean they were all adults by the "30's and they were all married and had children and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="78">The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean "Markusfeld" is very important.</sentence><sentence id="79">She was a Markusfeld.</sentence><sentence id="80">Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld.</sentence><sentence id="81">She must have been a very feisty lady, she sounds like it.</sentence><sentence id="82">She ran this <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, she had her six kids "which she raised by herself, or at least partly.</sentence><sentence id="83">We have a picture of her.</sentence><sentence id="84">She looks like a Jewish woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but she was kind of a neat lady, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Do you know when she was born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed.</sentence><sentence id="129">So that would make her born in the 1880's.</sentence><sentence id="130">Right and if my father was born in 1907 that's about right.</sentence><sentence id="131">So she would have been born in the 1880's or 1870's, probably in the 1870's if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third or fourth child.</sentence><sentence id="132">And I think my father's father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the 1870's.</sentence><sentence id="133">My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world.</sentence><sentence id="134">Yiddish was of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews.</sentence><sentence id="135">But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish.</sentence><sentence id="136">And certainly my cousin Mutti, the one who moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1937, "38, Mutti went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span> in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">Polish elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>, that they were not anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="137">I don't know if he's telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be nostalgia.</sentence><sentence id="138">I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990's after living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned in the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he didn't use it.</sentence><sentence id="139">But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently.</sentence><sentence id="140">He knew Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="141">Now that's unusual.</sentence><sentence id="142">That would indicate also a Zionist whatever.</sentence><sentence id="143">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="144">My mother says he knew Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="145">Now what does that mean.</sentence><sentence id="146">She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli.</sentence><sentence id="147">I don't remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="148">Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant he...... Certainly he had a traditional cheder education and he was well versed.</sentence><sentence id="149">He wasn't a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="150">It wasn't rote.</sentence><sentence id="151">He could look at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said.</sentence><sentence id="152">He knew Russian.</sentence><sentence id="153">I don't know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German.</sentence><sentence id="154">So he knew his languages.</sentence><sentence id="155">Okay what else can I say about just childhood.</sentence><sentence id="156">My father was clearly a very mischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example about how they tormented the Malamed at <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span>, how they tormented the teacher at the traditional <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">In fact I remember when I was in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> as a child he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that</sentence><sentence id="159">I did to our teachers.</sentence><sentence id="160">And he did all the things you read about in all the <span class="BUILDING">Haskala</span>, I mean putting tacks on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and putting honey on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx.</sentence><sentence id="161">And the other thing is that his sister Nehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama wanted a date.</sentence><sentence id="162">World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience.</sentence><sentence id="163">In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed.</sentence><sentence id="164">And she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn't want her to because her mother was still very traditional.</sentence><sentence id="165">And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And they did this through some kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armoire</span>, in Europe they have these <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> and apparently they would move it against the <span class="DLF">window</span> and open the <span class="DLF">window</span> and open the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">I don't remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">family car</span> in the 1950's with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying.</sentence><sentence id="168">But, you know, nothing serious.</sentence><sentence id="169">She didn't cover her hair, actually.</sentence><sentence id="170">Pictures we have of her or that I've seen of her as an adult, she didn't cover her hair.</sentence><sentence id="171">So clearly this was a very mischievous child.</sentence><sentence id="172">He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind.....and survivors, of course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts.</sentence><sentence id="173">Okay, I think I don't know very much more about my father's real childhood, that is when he was a baby.</sentence><sentence id="174">If I think of anything I'll come back to it.</sentence><sentence id="175">My father got married pretty young.</sentence><sentence id="176">He got married when he was about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply.</sentence><sentence id="177">So this was also non-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Was it a first cousin?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: You know I think it was a first cousin.</sentence><sentence id="233">I think it was his first cousin.</sentence><sentence id="234">I'm not a hundred per cent positive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin.</sentence><sentence id="235">Her father owned a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> in the Warsaw area in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span>, which I think is spelled W_OL OM _LN,I'mnota hundred per cent sure but I think so.</sentence><sentence id="236">It's in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">So he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span>, and he ran his father-in-law's business or worked with his father-in-law in running the business.</sentence><sentence id="238">His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella I don't remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and she was warmed by doctors not to have any children and she then didn't listen.</sentence><sentence id="239">She wanted a child, it wasn't accidental.</sentence><sentence id="240">They weren't that religious and she died very shortly after he was born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: So you think she was probably about twenty years old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: She was probably twenty, twenty-one.</sentence><sentence id="253">I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the same age or a year younger.</sentence><sentence id="254">She was very young.</sentence><sentence id="255">Their son's name was Avraham.</sentence><sentence id="256">He was named after my father's father.</sentence><sentence id="257">Avraham was born therefore, let's see in 1943 when he was killed, he was twelve.</sentence><sentence id="258">So he was born in 1931.</sentence><sentence id="259">So my father wasn't twenty-one, he was twenty-four.</sentence><sentence id="260">Well, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="261">These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931.</sentence><sentence id="262">And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally.</sentence><sentence id="263">And the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella.</sentence><sentence id="264">In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives.</sentence><sentence id="265">I just don't remember which was the first and which was the second.</sentence><sentence id="266">I think Perella was the second.</sentence><sentence id="267">I think Mira was the first.</sentence><sentence id="268">Again I'm really not a hundred percent sure.</sentence><sentence id="269">Again my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would know the answer.</sentence><sentence id="270">And they had another child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: The family talked him into it.</sentence><sentence id="297">Was this under duress then that he did this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="301">The child needs a mother, what better mother than her sister.</sentence><sentence id="302">She needs a husband, she's a nice lady, why don't you just marry her.</sentence><sentence id="303">You know I think it was that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="304">And he was very depressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid.</sentence><sentence id="305">I don't know exactly but he definitely married her.</sentence><sentence id="306">And it was all right.</sentence><sentence id="307">Obviously it was sad.</sentence><sentence id="308">I didn't know this when I was a child.</sentence><sentence id="309">When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war.</sentence><sentence id="310">But for whatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust, he didn't tell me about the fact that his first wife had died.</sentence><sentence id="311">He thought that would be too sad for me.</sentence><sentence id="312">Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="313">And that he could tell me about.</sentence><sentence id="314">But the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife's death he didn't tell me.</sentence><sentence id="315">I found out when I was twenty or something.</sentence><sentence id="316">A cousin of his in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually.</sentence><sentence id="317">I said, what are you talking about?</sentence><sentence id="318">And she told me the whole story and I just bawled.</sentence><sentence id="319">It was very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth.</sentence><sentence id="320">But anyway he did have a daughter with the second wife.</sentence><sentence id="321">Her name was Toby.</sentence><sentence id="322">That's what my mother called her.</sentence><sentence id="323">It's probably Tova, which again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="324"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tova</span> is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form.</sentence><sentence id="325">She was four years younger than Avraham.</sentence><sentence id="326">So she would have been born in 1934 or "35, something like that, or deg33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born.</sentence><sentence id="327">And my father continued to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> with his wife and running this <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as you know.</sentence><sentence id="329">There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the "frumie", the religious school system and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="330">He sent his children to a <span class="BUILDING">school system</span> that was very like American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or <span class="BUILDING">Bundist schools</span> where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of Polish.</sentence><sentence id="331">So his children went to this kind of modern <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which means, of course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the <span class="BUILDING">Bundist schools</span> which would indicate a kind of moderate religious position.</sentence><sentence id="332">So that's the kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he sent his kids to.</sentence><sentence id="333">As I said he kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">I don't think he was Sabbath observing.</sentence><sentence id="335">So he was kind of a little traditional, but not....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: And they spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I assume.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: You know I don't know what language.</sentence><sentence id="375">Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, that goes without saying.</sentence><sentence id="376">What language did he speak as an adult in his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span>?</sentence><sentence id="377">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="378">I really don't know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both.</sentence><sentence id="379">You know if you're utterly fluent it probably depends on your mood.</sentence><sentence id="380">Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he dreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="381">I bet they spoke Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="382">I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: That would be my guess.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="397">hour you were talking Polish.</sentence><sentence id="398">But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started talking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak.</sentence><sentence id="399">After the war in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> my father was utterly fluent in English.</sentence><sentence id="400">He learned English very quickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born.</sentence><sentence id="401">But with his friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends who were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern.</sentence><sentence id="402">None of them were orthodox and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="403">The natural language they would speak was Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="404">But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother crazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn't know Polish.</sentence><sentence id="405">And she would get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they would speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had parents because she was American and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="406">The thing they had on her was that they could speak more languages and so they would speak Polish.</sentence><sentence id="407">But my guess is that Yiddish would be the language of his <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">I don't know what kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he lived in.</sentence><sentence id="409">He was certainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">He still had brothers and I think his sister was there.</sentence><sentence id="411">His mother certainly was there.</sentence><sentence id="412">Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews.</sentence><sentence id="413">All of his brothers and sisters had married.</sentence><sentence id="414">They all had children.</sentence><sentence id="415">He was the closest with his sister.</sentence><sentence id="416">The sibling he talked the very most about was his sister.</sentence><sentence id="417">They were named for the same person.</sentence><sentence id="418">Mendel is a Yiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik.</sentence><sentence id="419">I should tell you my father's formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik Rosenblit which would translate -- Tzidik is Tzadok.</sentence><sentence id="420">Just a Jewish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who was called Nechuma, ??</sentence><sentence id="421">raised eyes that she was called Nechuma.</sentence><sentence id="422"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nechuma</span> was obviously named for the same person.</sentence><sentence id="423">She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after whatever relative, Menachem.</sentence><sentence id="424">So when my father was born they named him after the same relative.</sentence><sentence id="425">So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was unusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study medicine.</sentence><sentence id="426">That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of them died in the Holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years.</sentence><sentence id="427">I don't know what his wife did.</sentence><sentence id="428">I don't know if his wife worked or not.</sentence><sentence id="429">Probably not given the 1930's in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and middle class family.</sentence><sentence id="430">I doubt that she worked.</sentence><sentence id="431">They were definitely middle class.</sentence><sentence id="432">This is not somebody making -- with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because well maybe this isn't a good historical -- forget this.</sentence><sentence id="433">I was going to say I've seen the list of property that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparation claim.</sentence><sentence id="434">It's the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="435">But you know people could lie on those so that's not necessary a good source.</sentence><sentence id="436">I think that despite the very terrible situation for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the 1930's, you know very high anti-Semitism and very terrible economy and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="437">That my father did reasonably well.</sentence><sentence id="438">He certainly didn't give any thought as far as I know to migrating, although, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to migrate to except for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">And he wasn't enough of a Zionist to want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> although his brother Haim Yakov did.</sentence><sentence id="440">They had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> like probably every Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="441">In terms of his attitude to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, actually when he was born, he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and of course the Polish Jews hated <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because they were discriminated against so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national.</sentence><sentence id="442">I think he was a typical Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="443">If you asked him, who are you, what are you, he would say Iam a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="444">But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified with the Polish state.</sentence><sentence id="445">He thought of himself as a Polish subject.</sentence><sentence id="446">He used that word actually.</sentence><sentence id="447">He called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for</sentence><sentence id="449"><span class="BUILDING">kingdoms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="450">But that's how Jews were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">They were members of the Polish state but they weren't Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn't a Pole, he was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="452">I suppose he was hoping that the Polish Republic would get to be a nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> than it was.</sentence><sentence id="453">As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn't ask him such nice interesting political questions as what you thought about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and how you related to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="454">What else could I tell you about right before the

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="600">A: No, I have never done that.</sentence><sentence id="601">It's funny, I'm a historian and not a genealogist and so "m interested in what happened to the Jews and I've never bothered to look up the specifics of my father's experience in any systematic way.</sentence><sentence id="602">A lot of his experiences that he described are very, very similar to what you read in the memoirs.</sentence><sentence id="603">So it fits in very well.</sentence><sentence id="604">But I never tried to.....when I was reading Itzhak Arrad's book about ????</sentence><sentence id="605"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> which is about the operation 22?</sentence><sentence id="606"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> which basically gassed all the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and certainly the <span class="REGION">region</span> he was living in because the section of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that both he and his family was in was the general government.</sentence><sentence id="607">The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland and created the general government and the Soviets took the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">So my father was in the general government.</sentence><sentence id="609">Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">There was description of deportations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="611">There probably are no records of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="612">In any case, for the sake of argument I say that my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council.</sentence><sentence id="614">He never said that.</sentence><sentence id="615">This is not a memory I| have from him or from my mother or from my cousin Mutti who wouldn't have known because my cousin Mutti could only give me information about the pre-war period because he left in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="616">I have a memory from when I was a child of a friend of my father's from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span>, a man who had been a worker of his in his lumberyard who he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the war.</sentence><sentence id="617">He's still alive, a man named Shaya May.</sentence><sentence id="618">I think he's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="619">He was alive five years ago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="620">Shaya once I remember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually he was talking to my mother about my father during the war.</sentence><sentence id="621">He mentioned something about my father working for that traitorous Council or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="622">A lot of Jews hated the Council.</sentence><sentence id="623">He was certainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly would have come across his name if he were.</sentence><sentence id="624">The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had several hundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on the Council.</sentence><sentence id="625">So he may have worked on the Council.</sentence><sentence id="626">From my memories of all the stories of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> years I don't have any sense that he was in terrible shape.</sentence><sentence id="627">Obviously all the Jews had very little food and fuel and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="628">Things were very difficult in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="629">But his family was intact.</sentence><sentence id="630">He had a son and his daughter.</sentence><sentence id="631">His son and daughter attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="632">I think his wife taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="633">My mother said that.</sentence><sentence id="634">Either she taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or she taught <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="635">I think both stories, remember.</sentence><sentence id="636">So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance that took place, the organization of clandestine <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, and sort of doing moral and cultural and so forth things.</sentence><sentence id="637">I don't think I know very much more about the specific <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: So you don't know if they lived with other families or....?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: That I just don't know.</sentence><sentence id="679">The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never wanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time.</sentence><sentence id="680">I should add I have another source about my father's experiences and that is that when he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, the equivalent of "What I did on my summer vacation," he had to write an essay about his experiences.</sentence><sentence id="681">He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of it is missing.</sentence><sentence id="682">But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on.</sentence><sentence id="683">He doesn't provide specific details about what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears she made one.</sentence><sentence id="685">She doesn't know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy.</sentence><sentence id="686">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="687">But the copy just doesn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="688">Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal</sentence><sentence id="690">document that she typed for him.</sentence><sentence id="691">So I don't know if he lived with others or what the situation was.</sentence><sentence id="692">Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation.</sentence><sentence id="693">Most of his family, of course, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow ghetto</span> although he had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">Simcha was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew.</sentence><sentence id="695">He was shot during the time of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="697">So Simcha died before the deportations.</sentence><sentence id="698">And he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> because he had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don't know why he had moved or what he did at all.</sentence><sentence id="699">Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> he didn't really know the war.....he actually knew my father the least well because my father was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">He remembers my father coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to visit twice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="701">His stories are really best.</sentence><sentence id="702">From my cousin Mutti in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too.</sentence><sentence id="703">Anyway so I really don't know much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> years except that things were okay.</sentence><sentence id="704">His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay.</sentence><sentence id="705">Of course then came the deportations.</sentence><sentence id="706">During the deportations from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow ghetto</span>, his mother was shot.</sentence><sentence id="707">She was in her sixties and rather than take her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> or wherever they were taking the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>, they shot her.</sentence><sentence id="708">Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">She was shot.</sentence><sentence id="710">I assume the rest of his relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span>, aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> were deported to and gassed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Do you know what year this was, was it "43?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: No, well of all Polish Jewry, it's 42.</sentence><sentence id="749">The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically and liquidated all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> began something like March of "42 and was over by October "42 with some pockets left.</sentence><sentence id="750">That is there were Jews left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> and in the....was it the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>?</sentence><sentence id="751">Yeah the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin ghetto</span> was made into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and a couple of other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="752">There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue.</sentence><sentence id="753">Those were destroyed in "43.</sentence><sentence id="754">I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in "42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, in the Jeneska Road labor camp or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poniyet Tovah</span>, I forgot there were a whole bunch of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in the <span class="REGION">Lublin area</span> which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father's son was already twelve by that time then his older brother's kids could have been teenagers.</sentence><sentence id="755">So maybe they were in.....But I just don't know.</sentence><sentence id="756">I assume that everybody was just killed in deg42.</sentence><sentence id="757">His sister Nehama, though, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein.</sentence><sentence id="758">Yes, her name was Bernstein.</sentence><sentence id="759">Pearlman was my father's wife's maiden name.</sentence><sentence id="760">She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when I was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men's Benevolent Association and all the people who had come from my father's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama.</sentence><sentence id="761">They looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="762">I don't look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her.</sentence><sentence id="763">But anyway she and her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">They somehow escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">I don't know if they escaped in "42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> near there in the <span class="REGION">Lublin region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">And they were only killed in "44, about three months before the end of the war in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="767">They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point.</sentence><sentence id="768">So I don't know what happened to them if they were then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or if they were shot right away or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="769">But they did succeed in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="770">Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma.</sentence><sentence id="771">Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the</sentence><sentence id="773">name Helenie.</sentence><sentence id="774">There are pictures on the back that say Helenie.</sentence><sentence id="775">I think she was the only one that used a Polish name.</sentence><sentence id="776">My father didn't.</sentence><sentence id="777">He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names.</sentence><sentence id="778">But she used both Nechuma and Helenie.</sentence><sentence id="779">But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of vodka).</sentence><sentence id="780">The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews.</sentence><sentence id="781">Now I don't know if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles.</sentence><sentence id="782">Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows.</sentence><sentence id="783">I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there's not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and presumably they were deported in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="784">Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family was deported in "42 when most of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were deported.</sentence><sentence id="785">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow Haim</span>, his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> although his family hadn't.</sentence><sentence id="786">My father's brother Haim Yakov had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1937 alone.</sentence><sentence id="787">His son Mutti, followed him in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children.</sentence><sentence id="788">So they were all presumably killed also in "42.</sentence><sentence id="789">Shia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding until 44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he was deported, I assume, again I don't know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> took place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were deported.</sentence><sentence id="790">Now this is not necessarily true.</sentence><sentence id="791">He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time.</sentence><sentence id="792">He definitely was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because after the war my cousin Mutti in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own family.</sentence><sentence id="793">But her family was mostly in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because they were all Zionist who'd come mostly in the 20's.</sentence><sentence id="794">So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else.</sentence><sentence id="795">So in fact the first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in English.</sentence><sentence id="796">So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn't know English yet but Mutti knew English and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I didn't read it quite as easily.</sentence><sentence id="797">But she found nobody else.</sentence><sentence id="798">So I assume obviously she would have found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people.</sentence><sentence id="799">So he was presumably killed either in "42 or deg43 or deg44, everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="800">And Nehama definitely in deg44.</sentence><sentence id="801">Simcha at some point before "42, everybody else in "42 except for my father and his family.</sentence><sentence id="802">In any case assuming that my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> in August/September of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="803">That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, the 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German economy.</sentence></p></dialogue>

that April "43 date is so fundamentally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> that he had to have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="870">In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> because that's around, I mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was finally liquidated on the second night of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="871">And they didn't die that night.</sentence><sentence id="872">I'll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="873">So Pesach of 1943, so Pesach is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then.</sentence><sentence id="874">I don't know, maybe because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and that had such an impact on his conscience.</sentence><sentence id="875">His mother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="876">My father, therefore, and his wife and his children and his wife's sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">So he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="878">So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until April of 43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36.</sentence><sentence id="880">Well he wasn't yet because his birthday is November, so he was 35 years old.</sentence><sentence id="881">And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="882">And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto.</sentence><sentence id="883">Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> down.</sentence><sentence id="884">And my father and his family decided to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">I don't know if that means they went through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> or not.</sentence><sentence id="886">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> that's how people escaped from the ghetto.</sentence><sentence id="887">This is where he really told.</sentence><sentence id="888">My father told the stories from the escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> until liberation.</sentence><sentence id="889">That's what he told.</sentence><sentence id="890">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experience didn't interest him.</sentence><sentence id="891">That must mean that it was not too terrible.</sentence><sentence id="892">My image of hearing the story as a child was that they escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">But there are no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> or around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> even for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="894">So I don't know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">But in any case they escaped.</sentence><sentence id="896">Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non- Jews.</sentence><sentence id="897">And nobody would do it.</sentence><sentence id="898">He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that.</sentence><sentence id="899">So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they escaped and somehow they made it to some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, or maybe not to some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, they were just out.</sentence><sentence id="900">They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that person because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go to a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I was a little kid when I heard this so I don't know where it was.</sentence><sentence id="901">Somehow Avraham, my father's son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that's my way of Hebraisizing it again, it's Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham.</sentence><sentence id="902">Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="903">My father's wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no.</sentence><sentence id="904">We'll lose you if you do that.</sentence><sentence id="905">We have to stick together and go to the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="906">We'll find Avremy at the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="907">And she just was mad with concern for her son who's not technically her son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son.</sentence><sentence id="908">And she went to look for him and they never saw her again.</sentence><sentence id="909">I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, maybe she was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, I don't know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed.</sentence><sentence id="910">But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for.</sentence><sentence id="911">Who knows why he took them, but he took them.</sentence><sentence id="912">This is April of "43, my father, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don't know and then they were arrested, they were found.</sentence><sentence id="913">I mean it was very hard to really escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them.</sentence><sentence id="914">And he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="915">They were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="916">Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them</sentence><sentence id="918">were not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don't know how old his sister-in-law was, presumably in her thirties too but she was crippled.</sentence><sentence id="919">And she was as if the mother of these children.</sentence><sentence id="920">She was an adult female with two children.</sentence><sentence id="921">And so when they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, he was sent to the left or the right, whichever way.</sentence><sentence id="922">He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which means that they were gassed.</sentence><sentence id="923">So in April of 1943 his son and his daughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="924">But he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he was a slave laborer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="925">He worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot.</sentence><sentence id="926">He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was.</sentence><sentence id="927">My father talked about his experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> a lot.</sentence><sentence id="928">Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950's if you were a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk .</sentence><sentence id="929">People would say Mark what was it like.</sentence><sentence id="930">And he would talk.</sentence><sentence id="931">And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this.</sentence><sentence id="932">And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much.</sentence><sentence id="933">He certainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it.</sentence><sentence id="934">And in fact when people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing?</sentence><sentence id="935">Like my father would say we found a rat and we ate it or something.</sentence><sentence id="936">And they'd say, ooh how could you eat a rat?</sentence><sentence id="937">It's not really nasty.</sentence><sentence id="938">And he would say, you shouldn't talk, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire.</sentence><sentence id="939">I remember the expression, you don't know what it's like to be in a fire.</sentence><sentence id="940">But he wouldn't dwell on how awful it was except to indicate that it was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting.</sentence><sentence id="941">He indicated that but that's not what he dwelled on.</sentence><sentence id="942">What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive.</sentence><sentence id="943">The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do.</sentence><sentence id="944">I don't mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together to try to survive, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="945">For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things.</sentence><sentence id="946">He talked all the time of it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself.</sentence><sentence id="947">Onions or garlic so you could get vitamins.</sentence><sentence id="948">All of that which I've read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about the need to trade.</sentence><sentence id="949">Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed.</sentence><sentence id="950">So he talked about that a lot.</sentence><sentence id="951">He didn't use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="952">But he talked about that you really needed to do that.</sentence><sentence id="953">He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="954">My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="955">And that the only way you could survive such a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> was to hold on to the will to live and that's how you did it, you just held on to the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="956">Like literally held on to it.</sentence><sentence id="957">And every second said, I'm going to live, I'm going to live, I'm going to live.</sentence><sentence id="958">I just remember that vividly.</sentence><sentence id="959">I don't remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="960">There are different strategies that people used.</sentence><sentence id="961">That I don't remember, his own personal strategies.</sentence><sentence id="962">But I do remember him talking about that -- holding on to the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="963">I also remember that of course it made him</sentence><sentence id="965">lose all faith in <span class="NPIP">God</span>.</sentence><sentence id="966">Actually I don't remember that, I take that back.</sentence><sentence id="967">He did lose all faith in <span class="NPIP">God</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">But that he didn't tell me about.</sentence><sentence id="969">My mother told me about that when I was older.</sentence><sentence id="970">He didn't want me to know that because he didn't think that was fair to me.</sentence><sentence id="971">He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn't believe in God as a result of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="972">And he didn't believe in God because his children had been killed and everybody's children had been killed not just his.</sentence><sentence id="973">That didn't stop him from wanting to have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> or from going to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="974">He didn't stop being a Jew, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="975">Well, actually he did stop going to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> until I was born.</sentence><sentence id="976">From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>, he would not do anything religious.</sentence><sentence id="977">He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not do anything religious.</sentence><sentence id="978">No, that's not true.</sentence><sentence id="979">He would go to a Passover seder.</sentence><sentence id="980">I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">When I was born he didn't even think about it.</sentence><sentence id="982">He went to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> to name me.</sentence><sentence id="983">He was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="984">That's what eastern Jewry was like.</sentence><sentence id="985">You were a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="986">You did things because you were a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="987">Jews named their daughters in <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="988">The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="989">You know you had to.</sentence><sentence id="990">Just because you didn't believe in God didn't mean that you didn't name your daughter in <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">And that broke the ice and he went to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="992">He loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="993">He absolutely loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="994">He didn't go every week, he wasn't religious.</sentence><sentence id="995">But he went at least once a month.</sentence><sentence id="996">He really loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="997">In fact he even wanted me to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> but my mother didn't want me to go because we weren't that religious and in those days it was just <span class="BUILDING">orthodox schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="998">Getting back to his experiences I don't remember that he talked about how he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the loss of faith.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or other people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: No, I don't remember anything specific from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> except the business of trading bread for soap which is not a specific incident; I'm sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I think in his testimony for reparations he did provide some specific instances.</sentence><sentence id="1140">But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn't remember them and had lost the carbon copy.</sentence><sentence id="1141">I'm sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn't singled out.</sentence><sentence id="1142">I'm sure there were but I really don't unfortunately know any very specific thing.</sentence><sentence id="1143">In terms of what he actually did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I assume he did a variety of labor things.</sentence><sentence id="1144">He could be a carpenter so presumably when they asked him what do you do, he said I'm a carpenter and they did have him building.</sentence><sentence id="1145">My mother used to say that he built <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1146">But they were already built by the time he got there so I don't -- see my mother was really bad at detail.</sentence><sentence id="1147">It was a shame.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I'm a historian concerned with detail and she wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And my father died when I was young.</sentence><sentence id="1150">So I'm bringing all these memories of sitting around our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> listening so I can think of something very specific.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse, and he would say, lady, you haven't been through a fire, you don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1167">People were in awe of my father.</sentence><sentence id="1168">He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories.</sentence><sentence id="1169">I don't remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I'11 come to something.</sentence><sentence id="1172">don't remember anything specific.</sentence><sentence id="1173">I do know that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from April of "43 until January of "45 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1174">In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1175">Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions of other people described -- marched off people to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And my father was part of that death march.</sentence><sentence id="1177">I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">I remember him saying that it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1179">It was January, it was winter, and they didn't have boots and they didn't have coats.</sentence><sentence id="1180">Two thirds of the people died.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And I remember him saying that you couldn't fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die.</sentence><sentence id="1182">The snow was deceptive.</sentence><sentence id="1183">You think that it's warm when you're in it and so you could fall asleep.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And then of course you freeze to death because in fact it's not warm it's cold.</sentence><sentence id="1185">So you should never go to sleep in the snow.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay awake.</sentence><sentence id="1187">In some of the memoirs I've read about how they were put in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span>, my father never talked about that.</sentence><sentence id="1188">He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people up.</sentence><sentence id="1189">The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1190">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612"

id="1200">So he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945.</sentence><sentence

of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the actual moment but I won't put this in my father's record.</sentence><sentence id="1204">It's one of those classic stories, the other story of how this other person got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1205">The Nazis left the camp before the Americans got there and he was wandering around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1206">That's not my father's story.</sentence><sentence id="1207">Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been his employee in <span

said what are you doing that for because now we have food.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And Shia was still too scared that there would be no food.</sentence><sentence id="1210">But that again is not my father's story because that's not what he did.</sentence><sentence id="1211">He of course was nothing at the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1212">He was utterly emaciated and utterly

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1279">He was actually old to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1280">Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why they're still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1281">My father if he were alive today would be in his eighties.</sentence><sentence id="1282">I mean he happened to die when he was young.</sentence><sentence id="1283">He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he hadn't died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old.</sentence><sentence id="1284">No, that's not right.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday.</sentence><sentence id="1286">Whereas most of the survivors that</sentence><sentence id="1288">you talk to I'm sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1289">My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been extraordinarily strong.</sentence><sentence id="1290">It's funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already be no longer at the height of their physical strength but it's true.</sentence><sentence id="1291">So it's just amazing that he lived.</sentence><sentence id="1292">But anyway he was liberated by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1293">He did not go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> which was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1294">He must have learned English working for them or before but he lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1295">He had a real <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and had a real job and sort of went about his business.</sentence><sentence id="1296">I assume for a few months, I mean I assume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate.</sentence><sentence id="1297">In fact he said that it was months before he felt like a human being again.</sentence><sentence id="1298">I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked around the streets of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and looked for a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="1299">He found a dentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth.</sentence><sentence id="1300">The dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need.</sentence><sentence id="1301">He was so into pain that it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1302">And the German dentist didn't charge him because my father had a number, he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1303">He just showed his number.</sentence><sentence id="1304">In fact in those days you just showed your number and you got anything.</sentence><sentence id="1305">He didn't pay for too much after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1306">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I think was also free.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1338">Q: I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived there.</sentence><sentence id="1339">And I said how did you get food.</sentence><sentence id="1340">Well, we got food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1344">A: Well, if they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> they got food from the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: No, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: But if they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before that he didn't have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1350">Q: There was guilt.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1352">A: Yeah, although the Germans didn't have any food.</sentence><sentence id="1353">They must have been given food by the American army of occupation.</sentence><sentence id="1354">He must have just been given it.</sentence><sentence id="1355">I don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="1356">I know somebody who studies the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>, she might know.</sentence><sentence id="1357">Anyway, so he wasn't ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1358">I assume he stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> because that's what they did.</sentence><sentence id="1359">They set up <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and gave people food and medicine and let them come to themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1360">We have pictures of my father right after the war, not right, right after the war but in "46 where he looks fine.</sentence><sentence id="1361">He had obviously regained his strength and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1362">But so he lived and worked for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and he did have <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which is very weird.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And she knew Yiddish which is very weird.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1376">Q: I heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1378">A: Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian.</sentence><sentence id="1379">She was a beautiful woman.</sentence><sentence id="1380">Her name was Lisa, well probably Elizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname.</sentence><sentence id="1381">Just a beautiful woman.</sentence><sentence id="1382">Her husband had been a soldier probably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access to food and people were starving.</sentence><sentence id="1383">She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1384">To live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just</sentence><sentence id="1386">..... Lremember him saying he used to have <span class="NPIP">dreams</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1387">His mother would come and beat him up in his <span class="NPIP">dreams</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1388">The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was -- a German shiksa no else.</sentence><sentence id="1389">Well, I mean from my grandmother's point of view a shiksa is a shiksa, it doesn't matter what kind.</sentence><sentence id="1390">But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn't really help.</sentence><sentence id="1391">Pll show you her picture.</sentence><sentence id="1392">She was gorgeous, just beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="1393">I have this huge urge to look her up although she's probably eighty-five years old, too.</sentence><sentence id="1394">I mean at the end of the war how old was my father?</sentence><sentence id="1395">In 1947 he was forty right.</sentence><sentence id="1396">And she may have been ten years younger so she would only be in her mid-seventies at this time.</sentence><sentence id="1397">I don't know her name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1420">Q: I think it would be interesting to learn something about her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: I don't know her name.</sentence><sentence id="1423">Her name is Lisa.</sentence><sentence id="1424">I don't know her last name.</sentence><sentence id="1425">Although actually some of my father's Lukower friends, that is the friends from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that he met again in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, they might know her name because she lived with him.</sentence><sentence id="1426">All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1427">There she is, she's with them.</sentence><sentence id="1428">My father did know German though, he probably did speak to her in German.</sentence><sentence id="1429">Anyway, so he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1430">That was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution.</sentence><sentence id="1431">I guess because he worked for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that.</sentence><sentence id="1432">And he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1433">I don't think he ever had any contact with her again.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Maybe initially he did but not for very long.</sentence><sentence id="1435">He got himself a job very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1436">It was the only job he ever had in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1437">He actually lived with a Lukower.</sentence><sentence id="1438">He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> God knows when.</sentence><sentence id="1439">But her son, Muttel, who was my father's friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father's friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman.</sentence><sentence id="1440">Muttel came later to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="1441">But he lived with Mrs. Feldman.</sentence><sentence id="1442">He wandered around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lower Manhattan</span> looking for a job, he got a job right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that's inside <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1443">And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with wood, he owned a <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span>, and he was also very handy, actually more than handy.</sentence><sentence id="1444">He was talented with his hands.</sentence><sentence id="1445">He could build beautiful things and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1446">So he got a job there, initially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn't -- I don't know, whatever -- but he also worked for them supervising job installations.</sentence><sentence id="1447">When they did <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bambergers</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, he went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bambergers</span> and made sure the job was done right.</sentence><sentence id="1448">And what he wanted more than anything was to save up enough money to open some kind of <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1449">He was an entrepreneur by nature and that's what he wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="1450">He died before he could do that.</sentence><sentence id="1451">But that's what he wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="1452">So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days -- oh actually I have a funny story to tell.</sentence><sentence id="1453">I know you're mostly interested in the Holocaust but I love this story.</sentence><sentence id="1454">When he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he was met at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> by his aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus.</sentence><sentence id="1455">Actually she was an aunt-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1456">She was his mother's brother's wife.</sentence><sentence id="1457">His mother's brother had died.</sentence><sentence id="1458">They had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> probably before World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American.</sentence><sentence id="1459">Anyway his uncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and she said to him, today I'll speak to you in Yiddish, tomorrow only English.</sentence><sentence id="1460">You're now in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, you have to speak English.</sentence><sentence id="1461">Presumably he knew some English because he worked for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1462">Today I will call you Mendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name is Mark.</sentence><sentence id="1463">She gave him a name that was common in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1464">In 1947 Mark was a common name.</sentence><sentence id="1465">So in fact, when he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark.</sentence><sentence id="1466">So in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternate.....she called him Mark most of the time,</sentence><sentence id="1468">but she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1469">Mendel was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1470">He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark.</sentence><sentence id="1471">Although he used it, it was his American name.</sentence><sentence id="1472">My cousins called him uncle Mark and my uncle called him - - I mean everybody called him Mark.</sentence><sentence id="1473">Anyway he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, was met by his aunt, he got a job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in November of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950.</sentence><sentence id="1474">The rest is history.</sentence><sentence id="1475">He adjusted extremely well to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1476">He loved <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1477">He felt utterly happy to be American.</sentence><sentence id="1478">He had an American wife which is unusual for survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1479">He didn't feel the need to be -----of course he was friends with all the people who survived from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1480">My mother hated them.</sentence><sentence id="1481">They were a bunch of people who survived from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1482">Actually a very large number considering how tiny the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1483">Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muttel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1484">I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muttel</span> had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1485">Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet.</sentence><sentence id="1486">God, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen.</sentence><sentence id="1487">They're so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it's amazing.</sentence><sentence id="1488">And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband.</sentence><sentence id="1489">There's this sort of crew of people that I grew up with.</sentence><sentence id="1490">Those people, I haven't seen them in a hundred years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1562">Q: But they all ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1564">A: They all ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, all the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1565">There were probably eight of them; it's not like there were hundreds of them.</sentence><sentence id="1566">But there were some of them.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Some of them actually subsequently moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">In the 50's and 60's they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and 70's and some of them retired to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1569">Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1570">But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">I mean, unless they're dead, I haven't spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1572">So my father adjusted very, very well to life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1573">He really did.</sentence><sentence id="1574">He didn't want to have children because he lost two.</sentence><sentence id="1575">He had one because he thought it wasn't fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn't have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your children.</sentence><sentence id="1576">In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously.</sentence><sentence id="1577">He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said.</sentence><sentence id="1578">I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="1579">That was from my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1580">He was in his daily life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, fine.</sentence><sentence id="1581">He joked and laughed and was successful.</sentence><sentence id="1582">I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family.</sentence><sentence id="1583">I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares.</sentence><sentence id="1584">He missed his son profoundly.</sentence><sentence id="1585">He was in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="1586">He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his son died just before his own.</sentence><sentence id="1587">The loss of his children was really unbearable to him.</sentence><sentence id="1588">The loss of everyone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1614">Q: That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: I felt it an honor.</sentence><sentence id="1617">I felt very privileged.</sentence><sentence id="1618">I felt very special as a child.</sentence><sentence id="1619">I felt that I was privy, very close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better than others.</sentence><sentence id="1620">I felt honored.</sentence><sentence id="1621">I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1622">But I felt very special.</sentence><sentence id="1623">I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn't have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain of it.</sentence><sentence id="1624">I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1625">Both because of the Lukower, all of</sentence><sentence id="1627">these people who had survived, but also because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1628">There were lots of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1629">I had friends whose parents were survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Not all my friends, certainly.</sentence><sentence id="1631">In fact probably most of my friends didn't have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg's parents were survivors and whatever, I don't have to name all the names.</sentence><sentence id="1632">But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all.</sentence><sentence id="1633">But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility, probably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old.</sentence><sentence id="1634">I remember, my father always talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1635">We didn't call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or the Nazis, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1636">So I don't remember not knowing about it.</sentence><sentence id="1637">I always knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="1638">But I do remember the first time I saw pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1639">There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would know how horrible the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And my father had a set.</sentence><sentence id="1641">In the back it said "Zo vais in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>" So it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1642">It was horrific pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1643">You know those really gross <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1644">And I remember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I remember that very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="1646">I mean this wasn't a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive.</sentence><sentence id="1647">Not then, he was already dead.</sentence><sentence id="1648">Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1649">Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1686">Q: I think that should probably cover it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1690">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1691">If there's anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have it in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1694">A: Yeah, I'm just trying to think.</sentence><sentence id="1695">You know of course I'm not the survivor so I can't give you the details that your survivors are giving you.</sentence><sentence id="1696">My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn't get a chance to question him and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1697">My cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> could only provide information about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="1698">My mother was bad at detail.</sentence><sentence id="1699">So it's a hard thing.</sentence><sentence id="1700">Let me just think of a few other <span class="NPIP">things</span> randomly.</sentence><sentence id="1701">My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1702">He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn't hate all Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1703">I mean I think the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that.</sentence><sentence id="1704">He taught me that.</sentence><sentence id="1705">He taught me that I had to distinguish between people.</sentence><sentence id="1706">Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil.</sentence><sentence id="1707">I probably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1708">That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although.</sentence><sentence id="1709">That was the sense I probably got.</sentence><sentence id="1710">I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people.</sentence><sentence id="1711">I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog.</sentence><sentence id="1712">From my father I learned that you survived because you were clever.</sentence><sentence id="1713">You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically.</sentence><sentence id="1714">You were clever.</sentence><sentence id="1715">You figured things out.</sentence><sentence id="1716">You were lucky, gutsy.</sentence><sentence id="1717">That's what made you live, not being underhanded and mean but being tough and strong.</sentence><sentence id="1718">In fact I had a wonderful experience.</sentence><sentence id="1719">I went to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1981 and I in fact gave a paper on it.</sentence><sentence id="1720">I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level.</sentence><sentence id="1721">But I went to not all the sessions but many of the sessions.</sentence><sentence id="1722">I went to the final session which was held at the <span class="BUILDING">kotel</span>, at the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, when there were speeches.</sentence><sentence id="1723">Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird.</sentence><sentence id="1724">But anyway English</sentence><sentence id="1726">was the common language because there were French survivors and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1727">Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold.</sentence><sentence id="1728">It was at night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1729">Begin, maybe he wasn't the last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly.</sentence><sentence id="1730">Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because thee were hundreds of speakers.</sentence><sentence id="1731">He was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1732">He was already prime minister.</sentence><sentence id="1733">He was going on and on and he was really being nasty.</sentence><sentence id="1734">He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn't live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> they were traitors to the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1735">It was a really not nice, disgusting speech.</sentence><sentence id="1736">Half the crowd started to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1737">They just started to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1738">They picked themselves up and they walked.</sentence><sentence id="1739">My <span class="REGION">American side</span>, that is my <span class="REGION">Protestant side</span>, I mean I'm not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the <span class="REGION">American side</span> that you just stand on <span class="DLF">line</span> whatever, was appalled that they would do that.</sentence><sentence id="1740">Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think he's saying awful things, and I certainly don't agree with Menachem Begin politically and I though what he was saying was awful.</sentence><sentence id="1741">But still he's the prime minister of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1742">You don't get up and leave in the middle of his speech.</sentence><sentence id="1743">It's just not nice even if you're cold and even if you're unhappy you don't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1744">And so I was really annoyed.</sentence><sentence id="1745">My sort of <span class="REGION">American side</span> that hates when people cheat on <span class="DLF">line</span> was getting very angry.</sentence><sentence id="1746">And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation, wait a second, that's why they survived.</sentence><sentence id="1747">They just do what seems to them the right thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="1748">And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1749">My father's dead for a long time and I've moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them.</sentence><sentence id="1750">I didn't leave because I'm not them.</sentence><sentence id="1751">But they left because that's why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life.</sentence><sentence id="1752">The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings.</sentence><sentence id="1753">Even if they're a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics.</sentence><sentence id="1754">And the ones who are were lunatics anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1755">The ones who are were lunatics before the war.</sentence><sentence id="1756">This had a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for the most part.</sentence><sentence id="1757">There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals.</sentence><sentence id="1758">All the survivors I know as children all of them made it.</sentence><sentence id="1759">Even if they were just laborers, they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families.</sentence><sentence id="1760">They were fine, they were really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that's understandable.</sentence><sentence id="1761">But anyway so I love them all because they are what they are.</sentence><sentence id="1762">They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the moment instinctively.</sentence><sentence id="1763">I don't know if there's anything else I can say at all.</sentence><sentence id="1764">This is not about my father's American experience and that's of course what I'm most familiar with.</sentence><sentence id="1765">He had a good one.</sentence><sentence id="1766">He spoke English all the time to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1767">They spoke Yiddish when they didn't want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1768">He was fiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn't fast on Yom Kippur because he didn't believe in God anymore and he'd gone hungry long enough.</sentence><sentence id="1769">But I didn't know he didn't fast on Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="1770">He didn't want me to know that because ......1 mean I'm sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little.</sentence><sentence id="1771">I think that's all I have to say, at least now.</sentence><sentence id="1772">If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1854">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1855">I want to thank you very much for your time and for this interesting story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1858">A: You're welcome, you're welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1859">Let me add just one last thing.</sentence><sentence id="1860">I know this is not going to go into the cards that you're doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1864">Q: Yes they will.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1869">A: So ["ll just say it.</sentence><sentence id="1870">My son is named for my father.</sentence><sentence id="1871">I'm named for my father's mother and he's named for my father.</sentence><sentence id="1872">And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark and it's very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1873">And he really feels connected to my father and to the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1874">He has always known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do.</sentence><sentence id="1875">I feel it both in my professional life and in my personal life.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And I'm very pleased that I was able to tell my son about the Holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way that emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be careful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a Holocaust survivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey the meaning of the Holocaust to the next generation and I'm glad I was able to do it with my own son.</sentence><sentence id="1877">A lot of children of Holocaust survivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for interviewing me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1887">Q: Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1889">A: I have one more thing to add, I just remembered.</sentence><sentence id="1890">When the Nazis occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1939, my father's wife said to him, escape to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, you can do that for a couple of months in September, October, November of 1939; you go escape.</sentence><sentence id="1891">After all the Germans won't hurt women and children but they might hurt men.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And my father said well it's true the Germans certainly won't hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1893">His memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied Poland the situation of the Jews improved.</sentence><sentence id="1894">The Germans were civilized and nice and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1895">So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn't be so bad but he didn't want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn't want to go to the east.</sentence><sentence id="1896">He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1897">I will take my chances with the Germans and I don't want to leave my family alone and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1898">So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1899">That's all I wanted to add...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1911">Q: Thanks.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1913">A: You're welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1914">My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing terrible things to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1915">He understood that.</sentence><sentence id="1916">He just thought that ultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that it was at best to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with family and take one's chances with these Germans than go off to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
