<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> until 1937 and in 1937, after a long struggle, my parents managed to obtain a permission from the Polish...pre-War Polish authorities that my mother could be transferred and could teach in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which my father was working.</sentence><sentence id="96">Uh...A rather unbelievable situation for us today in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but it was common place in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">So in 1937, we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilena</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boleslawiece</span>, which was a sort of a equivalent of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>, of...of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">And we...there I lived with my father for the remaining 2 years before the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="99">And there I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private elementary school</span> which was called __ (ph).</sentence><sentence id="100">And...uh...finished the last grade which I believe was 6th and took my entrance examination to what was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, beginning of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, roughly equivalent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">And that's when the war broke out in September 1, 1939.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Tell us about it, will you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: About a year...about a month before, obviously...uh...the adults were aware of what was going on and we children were becoming slowly aware of the gathering clouds.</sentence><sentence id="112">And my father was a reserve...uh...uh...officer.</sentence><sentence id="113">He was a first lieutenant...I guess lieutenant in the Polish army, and in August...uh...the reserve company in that he was part of went on maneuvers.</sentence><sentence id="114">I was Il and a half, and that was the last time I saw him until I saw him in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in January 1949.</sentence><sentence id="115">He never came back.</sentence><sentence id="116">The war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="117">He was fighting.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">Uh...Of course, we didn't know what was going to happen and about the tenor of the pre- war Polish press was...uh...we will fight the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="119">We will not let them take over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">So little did we know how powerful Nazis armies were.</sentence><sentence id="121">And the war broke out and..uh...(sigh) within a few days, first waves of refugees started coming.,...</sentence><sentence id="122">telling hair raising stories about atrocities committed on the population by the Germany army, by the indiscriminate bombing, by the German air force of crowded <span class="DLF">roads</span> filled with refugees, with..with men, women, children, possessions, animals.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="123">Uh...It was extremely scary.</sentence><sentence id="124">It...Many times I said to my friends who are questioning me about this period that my childhood ended on September 1, 39.</sentence><sentence id="125">Uh...Within couple weeks, the threat of the advancing German armies were so great that all the able bodied men who otherwise were not in the armies started drifting east to escape the advancing German armies.</sentence><sentence id="126">To escape...to possibly join the Polish army somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="127">And that's where...I forget the date, but obviously it's known to history...uh...suddenly as...as.. as we realized we were stabbed in the back by the Soviet armies marching into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the east and completely...uh.. destroying whatever little resistance there was to...to the advancing German forces.</sentence><sentence id="128">Only then we learned about the Molitov/Ribbontrop (ph) pact, dividing <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and within a couple days after this event, the Germans marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boleslawiece</span> and...uh..for some reason I remember the...the day very vividly because that was the day that I had to an optometrist to pick up my first pair of glasses.</sentence><sentence id="129">And they were little beady little things...uh..but I had to wear them and I walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">optometrist's shop</span> and the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> kind of looked crooked, but people were pointing out to...to the advancing...marching German.</sentence><sentence id="130">Actually men...Germans didn't march.</sentence><sentence id="131">They were riding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and their green uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="132">People were reaching out to them, and the Germans were throwing cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="133">That was my first impression of the German army.</sentence><sentence id="134">Uh...Within time that I cannot determine and now in retrospect I know that it was pursuant to some agreement between the Russians and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="135">The Germans withdrew and the Soviet troops moved in.</sentence><sentence id="136">They were...uh...they were shabby looking, and they were...they were terribly looking...uh...neglected by our standards, un...unused to western facilities.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="137">Uh...Immediately in ...in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, Russian authorities quartered some officers or some other people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="138">They had to be explained about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet bowls</span> and things like this.</sentence><sentence id="139">They didn't know what they were for.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: What about you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: I guess the overwhelming feeling was of fear for my father, fear for what's going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="142">I had forgotten until a few days before our interview, as I started thinking about those years and those times, how terribly fear dominated our lives were.</sentence><sentence id="143">How easy it was to control whole populations by terror in those days.</sentence><sentence id="144">And I as a 12 year old kid was simply scared of what's going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="145">But as soon as the Soviets walked in, they ostenaciously opened the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="146">And we were...the same teachers were permitted to continue to teach and we were allowed to return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, encouraged to return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">New subjects were introduced.</sentence><sentence id="148">Russian.</sentence><sentence id="149">Ukrainian since this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was...uh...a majority of population was Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="150">And we were...back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">Now in retrospect I see how terribly...uh...disturbed I was by the events because my grades plummeted.</sentence><sentence id="152">I was bring nothing but Ds and Cs from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I was an A student before.</sentence><sentence id="153">Uh...Psychologists will tell you this is the first sign that something is wrong with a kid when he doesn't get good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">Uh...But obviously we were in..in...in great fear for what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="155">In the meantime, we received a post card from our father saying that he is interned in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yur</span> (ph) where Polish armies that after they could no longer fight the Germans and Soviets, they crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and were interned there under rather benign conditions because Hungarians, even though the government was collaborating, with the Nazis, the...the population...Hungarians were friends.</sentence><sentence id="156">We were permitted by the authorities to send a wire to my father...in German, and to this day I remember the text of the wire.</sentence><sentence id="157">Gesei Gesunt (ph).</sentence><sentence id="158">We are healthy.</sentence><sentence id="159">We are well.</sentence><sentence id="160">That's all we were permitted to say in that <span class="DLF">wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And...uh...that's all we heard from my father for...for a very, very long time.</sentence><sentence id="162">Uh...In the meantime, the <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> continued.</sentence><sentence id="163">My mother was teaching....uh...sometimes some of our teachers had to be one lesson ahead of what they were teaching us.</sentence><sentence id="164">But we heard rumors that this is not going to last, this peace between the Germans and the Russians, although the Russians dismissed this propaganda and didn't...didn't allow it to...to...to be officially stated.</sentence><sentence id="165">And...uh...I may not recall anything from that period, except that I, of course, had many Jewish friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And uh, we were so involved in our own little world.</sentence><sentence id="167">Uh...The boys were talking about sex serupticiously.</sentence><sentence id="168">We were organizing poetry circles.</sentence><sentence id="169">Uh...We were exchanging letters.</sentence><sentence id="170">We had school mail where we would write letters to each other and..uh.. And then (pause) in June of 41, Hitler attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And within a day or 2, Soviets withdrew from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but first blowing up and devastating most of the important facilities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, such as a <span class="BUILDING">power house</span> and a lot of other installations.</sentence><sentence id="172">And the German, Nazis returned.</sentence><sentence id="173">And that is really when the terror started in earnest.</sentence><sentence id="174">The rumors started circulated that the Nazis are going to declare a...a day of liberty quote unquote for the Ukrainian population to settle the score with the Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="175">And to our horror one day came and suddenly there were pogroms everywhere with the Ukrainian peasants coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and beating and murdering Jewish families and...and...uh..and we, of course, stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> petrified and just didn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="176">Uh...At that time, the economic situation also changed.</sentence><sentence id="177">We started feeling a dearth of food and supplies.</sentence><sentence id="178">We started getting hungry.</sentence><sentence id="179">Everything was disrupted.</sentence><sentence id="180">The...the normal functioning of the society was reduced to the minimum and everything was being...uh..collected, confiscated by the Nazi authorities to help their war machine drive into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="181">Sigh) I heard numerous stories of what happened to my colleagues.</sentence><sentence id="182">Uh...I do not recall the details.</sentence><sentence id="183">It was too scary to even listen to, but I heard about my...one of my friends, Romack (ph), whose parents and...and sister were killed by the...and I'm not even sure by whom.</sentence><sentence id="184">And then he pleaded with them, "Kill me too.</sentence><sentence id="185">You killed the rest of my family."</sentence><sentence id="186">That's the only detail that I remember.</sentence><sentence id="187">We were getting...uh...progressively more and more...uh..desperate.</sentence><sentence id="188">The only way to survive was to take our possessions, whatever we had and whatever a Ukrainian farmer wanted and trade it for food.</sentence><sentence id="189">I remember through a friend we traded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> that my father had for 20 kilograms of Swani (ph), the pork fat or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="190">People were trading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, taking them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and getting some grain.</sentence><sentence id="191">I remember a grinding, ordinary grain in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffee grinder</span>, mixing it with water and salting it a little bit and baking it on top of the..the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas burning stove</span> and that would be our food.</sentence><sentence id="192">So it was really hard.</sentence><sentence id="193">So then we decided that we have to get back to <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> where my mother's sisters lived and where it would be easier to survive and have help from the two...two sisters and their families.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Before you move, you have talked about the pogroms in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">Can you tell me, when you came out from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, what was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="269">I had many friends.</sentence><sentence id="270">I had many friends.</sentence><sentence id="271">I visited one friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after that.</sentence><sentence id="272">Uh...And....uh...I came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I remember talking to his mother who was in tears and saying to me...uh...,Look, Panjawatko (ph), Mr. Witkowski (ph),in Polish you would Mr., but you would use the first name as sort of a half way familiar term between first name and using the last name.</sentence><sentence id="273">They just ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ransacked it.</sentence><sentence id="274">Look at this beautiful Trammel (ph).</sentence><sentence id="275">Trammel (ph) was a long, tall mirror that would have some sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pedestal</span> on the bottom, and a little shelf in front of it like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mantel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">They just came in and threw a stone in it and just shattered the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="277">Fortunately, in this friend's family nobody was hurt or killed, but I have heard about numerous situations in which people were...were beaten up or killed by the...by the Ukrainian peasants.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: Please go on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
