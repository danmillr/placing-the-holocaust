And she gathered us -- she -- she hugged us, she didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="7278">And later she was making plans, what kind of a party we'll have when Papa would come <span

or -- .</sentence><sentence id="7285">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0068 126 or a little girl by themselves, and there were lots of them, she says come and we'll eat something.</sentence><sentence id="7286">And she was a genius at making soup, and she'd add more water and whatever, I don't know, but everything she made, because we were hungry too, tasted so good.</sentence><sentence id="7287">And it was always shared with so much good feelings.</sentence><sentence id="7288">It wasn't just oh gosh, we don't have anything for tomorrow, you know, but well, we'll have something tomorrow too.</sentence><sentence id="7289">Enjoy it, and eat, you know.</sentence><sentence id="7290">And it -- it was -- she gave us so much -- she gave me so much strength.</sentence><sentence id="7291">And I wish I could be one-tenth of the person that she was.</sentence><sentence id="7292">And sh-she was strong, and she was very wise, and she wasn't the only one.</sentence><sentence id="7293">They -- she and a group of women organized a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a -- for the kids who didn't work, too young to work.</sentence><sentence id="7294">And there again, we could have lied about our age had we known ahead of time, but we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="7295">But this too was such a wonderful gesture, to -- to be with the kids.</sentence><sentence id="7296">And -- and they were tired and beat, you know, from the work that they did all day, and yet they would come with smiles on their faces and sing happy songs for us, just to keep us occupied and to give us something to do.</sentence><sentence id="7297">Yes, my mother was a very special woman, but she wasn't the only one.</sentence><sentence id="7298">I think ordinary people -- and my mother was not ordinary, she was extraordinary, but I think even ordinary people were made extraordinary by their circumstances in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7299">And I mean, what befell us, you know, when the Germans came in, that people who were ordinary became heroes.</sentence><sentence id="7300">And .</sentence><sentence id="7306"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0068 127 that happened everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="7307">That's another thing that I, nowadays feel very strongly about it, and I keep learning much more, is the fact that there was so much resistance, and there was so much -- there were uprisings, you know, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence

<span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7314">That's resistance.</sentence><sentence id="7315">And these kind of forms of resistance took place almost in every little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7316">And that is something that when we consider that there was practically no help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and even in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, how difficult it was to obtain weapons, and you know, how very -- even for money -- I mean, people would, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, would promise you weapons, and then you would come and you'd find empty shells or you know, corroded things that didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="7317">And when you think, that in spite of all of this, we were able to raise our voice, we should walk now with our heads high, too.</sentence><sentence id="7318">And I often say I'm very proud to be who I am.</sentence><sentence id="7319">I wouldn't change it for the world.</sentence><sentence id="7320">And I am proud of being a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="7321">And I am proud of having to sur-survive
