<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">JOE FRIEDMAN October 3, 1996</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good afternoon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Id like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, that covers quite a bit of <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span>, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span>, on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned.</sentence><sentence id="11">So there were three boys and three girls in the family.</sentence><sentence id="12">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> locally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span>, <span class="REGION">Missouri</span>, and of course grew up during the Depression.</sentence><sentence id="13">That covered quite a long era.</sentence><sentence id="14">We all worked.</sentence><sentence id="15">It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> and working my way through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as much as I could.</sentence><sentence id="16">Fortunately, we had a junior college in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree.</sentence><sentence id="17">But after that, I ran out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more.</sentence><sentence id="18">With that in mind, I went out to <span class="REGION">Colorado</span>, where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> -- <span class="DLF">Lakeside Amusement Park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ranches</span>, dude ranches, in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn't have enough money to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">So I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back.</sentence><sentence id="22">I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939.</sentence><sentence id="23">And made enough money to enter my first year of college-- of <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">I'm almost afraid to go down that <span class="DLF">alley</span> because it was my first profession.</sentence><sentence id="25">I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="26">I didn't want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing.</sentence><sentence id="27">In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">There were Jewish quotas.</sentence><sentence id="29">But I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and I talked to the registrar and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the summer of "39, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">Well, that was in the fall of "41, and we know what happened on December the seventh.</sentence><sentence id="31">During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as much as we could, everybody was gung ho.</sentence><sentence id="32">We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="33">Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn't get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- at least to finish that year, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="34">I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did.</sentence><sentence id="35">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and went into the army.</sentence><sentence id="36">I went into basic training to , <span class="REGION">Texas</span>, with the 95" Infantry Division.</sentence><sentence id="37">I had had ROTC in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="38">ROTC was very good because we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing.</sentence><sentence id="39">Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon.</sentence><sentence id="40">At the end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC.</sentence><sentence id="41">The second month, I made buck sergeant, I'm sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that's three stripes, then staff sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="42">Then I was ready to go to <span class="BUILDING">OCS</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could.</sentence><sentence id="44">I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn't send them into <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, so I didn't get to go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Did you ever talk to him about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Yes, yes, and the reason he didn't put the papers in, although he'd called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, "I don't want a kike (ph) on my staff".</sentence><sentence id="85">The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks.</sentence><sentence id="86">The reason he didn't send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97" Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work.</sentence><sentence id="87">And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS is very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="88">They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what's expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I'd have to spend would be to my advantage.</sentence><sentence id="89">And it was true.</sentence><sentence id="90">I did go to <span class="BUILDING">OCS</span> and it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="91">I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their <span class="DLF">bars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">Then we were sent to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">I finally ended up at a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters company</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span>, Florida, doing various jobs.</sentence><sentence id="94">And then went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: When did you go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> during the winter of "42-"43.</sentence><sentence id="109">We were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preston</span>, <span class="REGION">Lancashire</span>, and we crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish ship</span> called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Sobiesky</span> (ph) and when we got midway through the <span class="DLF">channel</span>, there was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">I later read, after the war, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> the same time we did was torpedoed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: When was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: It was. . .</sentence><sentence id="117">the dates are going to be a little difficult for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: The general time of year?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="123">It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the <span class="DLF">channel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being -- if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span>, and how lucky that I was.</sentence><sentence id="125">When they said that, ""you get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, or you get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, how many are in your complement", I said, ""Six officers and 96 men". "</sentence><sentence id="126">Okay, you get on this one, you get on that one."</sentence><sentence id="127">We were lucky enough to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Sobiesky</span> (ph) that turned back.</sentence><sentence id="128">The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel.</sentence><sentence id="129">I didn't know this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics.</sentence><sentence id="130">At any rate, we landed.</sentence><sentence id="131">We had to go over the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with a <span class="DLF">rope ladder</span> and landed in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing craft</span> and went into LeHarve(ph).</sentence><sentence id="132">Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren't being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> until we get onto <span class="REGION">dry land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">Once, and I'm going very fast because there's quite a bit to cover, once we got into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, we started moving very rapidly.</sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>, across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph).</sentence><sentence id="135">Then we went to, we were in the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baston</span>, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and then into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: From the beginning of winter, of "44, deg45.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: And the Battle of the Bulge was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: In winter of 45.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: deg44,deg45.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: And then you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baston</span> in February?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Around that time.</sentence><sentence id="165">I once read where someone was telling an account of, it might not have been his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said "My memory has a lot of holes in it."</sentence><sentence id="166">So I'm going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and tell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it.</sentence><sentence id="167">So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread.</sentence><sentence id="168">Now with the Third Army, sl hope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I know that this is the major thrust of the interview.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: We're in April.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: We're in April.</sentence><sentence id="177">Our troops uncovered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="178">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph) was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camps</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bookenblow</span> (ph) near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gotha</span> (ph) and you can't get the full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Back up a little bit for me.</sentence><sentence id="183">When you got the orders to go in and you were, how did you approach, what did the <span class="REGION">area</span> look like, what time of day was it, can you remember those things?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Do you have that whole memory?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="188">Vividly, vividly, it was daylight.</sentence><sentence id="189">Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>, and we could still smell it.</sentence><sentence id="190">In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I couldn't smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves.</sentence><sentence id="192">I've never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that's what they were wearing -- these striped pajamas, and I know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="193">I kept salivating.</sentence><sentence id="194">You know there's, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it's kind of a, well if you've ever done it, if you've ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there's, you know that you're going to throw up.</sentence><sentence id="195">And that's rather indelicate, but this is what happens.</sentence><sentence id="196">Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with their legs covered, and dead.</sentence><sentence id="197">Just all sorts of, maybe some in <span class="INT_SPACE">fetal positions</span>, lying in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">Those who were still alive, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, if you could call it a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn't have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pallet</span> that had been his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for many years.</sentence><sentence id="199">We did whatever we could -- we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on.</sentence><sentence id="200">I was still with the combat troop.</sentence><sentence id="201">Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first <span class="DLF">line</span> of casualties, and would carry them back to the <span class="BUILDING">evac hospitals</span> that were in the rear of the <span class="DLF">combat line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">We did whatever we could to make them comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="203">I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems.</sentence><sentence id="204">As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention.</sentence><sentence id="205">But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">civic center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I think this is true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: You didn't see it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: I didn't see it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: But you have reason to believe . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to walk around and talk with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="238">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: And did you talk with people?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Briefly, briefly. "</sentence><sentence id="241">Cause we'd both cry.</sentence><sentence id="242">There wasn't too much, we'd start a conversation and they would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give them.</sentence><sentence id="243">Then there was the <span class="DLF">language barrier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian.</sentence><sentence id="245">They came from the <span class="REGION">Balkan countries</span> as well, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing.</sentence><sentence id="247">They all had one thing in common -- that they were free.</sentence><sentence id="248">And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge.</sentence><sentence id="249">I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them.</sentence><sentence id="250">And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we've all learned about since then.</sentence><sentence id="251">I didn't know all this at that time.</sentence><sentence id="252">I was aware. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: What did you know then?</sentence><sentence id="267">Did you why these people were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="268">Did you know who they were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Right away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers.</sentence><sentence id="277">I knew that the majority of them were Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Do you know how you knew that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of German.</sentence><sentence id="283">But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities.</sentence><sentence id="284">But I didn't have any visual evidence of it until I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">I didn't know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn't know until later on when I read how they were put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span>, and put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and the methodical way that they were loaded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> with the elderly going in first, pushed in.</sentence><sentence id="286">And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> to land on top of whoever was there and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was sealed.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="287">If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> came into play, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> that they used to gas -- you know they would use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and by the time they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>. . .</sentence><sentence id="289">I didn't know all this until much later.</sentence><sentence id="290">When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn't been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations.</sentence><sentence id="291">Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn't any longer do that, it was off to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">That was all I knew then.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: And you saw mostly men?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Did you see women?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="299">I don't recall seeing any women then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: And did you spend some time -- how big was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="303">Did you see what work they were doing?</sentence><sentence id="304">Did you know that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="309">No.</sentence><sentence id="310">By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="311">They tried to kill as many as they could before they left.</sentence><sentence id="312">A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">I didn't see firsthand where they worked -- they weren't working anymore.</sentence><sentence id="314">They sort of spread out over the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Walking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Walking -- in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: How long did you stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff ph</span>)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Perhaps the larger part of two days.</sentence><sentence id="329">Maybe a day and then left on the second day.</sentence><sentence id="330">But during that time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="331">I couldn't help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I.
