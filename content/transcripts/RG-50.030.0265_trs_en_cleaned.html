<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: And what was his name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: That was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilfreet</span> (ph), which means in English will peace.</sentence><sentence id="47">And he was the one who was killed in the war.</sentence><sentence id="48">So, we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">As soon as the Nazi's came, my father was . ..</sentence><sentence id="50">Three SS (ph) men came into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and took him by the arm and led him out.</sentence><sentence id="51">He was the head of a very fine <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> where he really taught the liberal ideas and the classical ideas of and how people should live with each other.</sentence><sentence id="52">So, we were very grateful to a point that at that point he already had Parkinson's disease.</sentence><sentence id="53">So they, for the time being, did not arrest him because he was a rather known man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">He had written several books about the history of literature, and so they tried to go light about it.</sentence><sentence id="55">So, I can only say almost fortunately soon after the Nazis came, he died, because his fate otherwise would have been to be in one of the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">I had three brothers.</sentence><sentence id="57">My eldest brother, my oldest brother, Hans, he was a professor in mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="58">And later as I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where he was both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and in other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And my second brother, was physician as I, and lives in <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">Then I have a third brother, Vilfreet (ph) was his name, but really means to will peace.</sentence><sentence id="61">But he was the one who was killed in the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: What was it like as children together in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span>?</sentence><sentence id="80">How do you remember it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Well, one of my most wonderful memories are those days.</sentence><sentence id="84">And one of my saddest memories is that day when Hitler finally came to power.</sentence><sentence id="85">We didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span>, but we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">And everywhere, even in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, they blared out the Hitler music.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I remember very well my father.</sentence><sentence id="88">He assembled us that same night in 1933.</sentence><sentence id="89">And he said, "Look now, you see what has happened.</sentence><sentence id="90">And I want you to know that in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>,</sentence><sentence id="92">nothing will change.</sentence><sentence id="93">We will have the same values.</sentence><sentence id="94">We believe the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="95">We will be the same as we always are."</sentence><sentence id="96">But, he said, "We've got to be extremely careful now because we are known."</sentence><sentence id="97">My father was a very known educator in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">And he said, "You must learn to be quiet, not to shout "Heil Hitler", but to be quiet on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because this is the only hope we can survive this."</sentence><sentence id="99">And true enough, the next morning several of his SS (ph) men came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> early in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="100">They wish to come early so that they knew you were there.</sentence><sentence id="101">They asked for my father.</sentence><sentence id="102">But my father at that time already had a rather advanced case of Parkinson's disease, which really was a blessing because they couldn't transport him and they would have had all kinds of things to get him out there.</sentence><sentence id="103">And since my father was a rather known man, a rather known educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they were a little bit afraid to begin this, to rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> too much.</sentence><sentence id="104">So, they left him alone.</sentence><sentence id="105">And I can almost say since and very soon afterwards, he died.</sentence><sentence id="106">So, he was spared.</sentence><sentence id="107">But the very same day after that happened, that the Nazis came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I remember too well my father got us all together -- us four children and a mother.</sentence><sentence id="108">And he said, "Now you see what has happened, what is happening.</sentence><sentence id="109">But in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> everything will be the same.</sentence><sentence id="110">On the contrary, for now on we will be much more together than we ever been before.</sentence><sentence id="111">And I urge you not to be afraid."</sentence><sentence id="112">I remember that today. "</sentence><sentence id="113">Don't be afraid."</sentence><sentence id="114">We were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="115">Because known as my parents were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, we were really very much a target of being arrested.</sentence><sentence id="116">And the only reason that my father was not arrested because they came... At that time he was already so far advanced in his disease that they just let him alone and said, "Well, he's dying anyway.</sentence><sentence id="117">He's gone."</sentence><sentence id="118">So, that was the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="119">And I will tell you from there on, we really were about the closest knit family you ever have seen or ever have experienced.</sentence><sentence id="120">Because we lived in our own</sentence><sentence id="122"><span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">We had our values as we always had.</sentence><sentence id="124">We could be open with each other.</sentence><sentence id="125">And very soon we got a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">You see, many, many years ago, you didn't have all these wonderful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">You got a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">We never were very interested in radio, but for now on we always start to turn.</sentence><sentence id="129">Do you know what we were looking for?Finally, one day we found it.</sentence><sentence id="130">The radio from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">That was...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="189">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">Finally we got a voice from freedom.</sentence><sentence id="192">And from there on really morning, noon and night, whenever we had a spare minute, we listened to that radio which gave us the truth.</sentence><sentence id="193">I never forget that because it was almost an obsession.</sentence><sentence id="194">Don't ask me for television because we didn't have it at that time.</sentence><sentence id="195">We had only very tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">So, it was not all terrible grief because somehow this brought us together.</sentence><sentence id="197">And our Jewish friends -- and we had quite a few Jewish friends -- we'd gather together.</sentence><sentence id="198">Not anymore in the daytime.</sentence><sentence id="199">We came to them in the dark, after night.</sentence><sentence id="200">Or they came to us in the dark of the night.</sentence><sentence id="201">And very soon, of course, things got very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="202">I mean, Hitler was very smart.</sentence><sentence id="203">He had a way of finding the elite and try to decapitate them.</sentence><sentence id="204">It's an old system of any dictator.</sentence><sentence id="205">If you do that, of course, the rest will go.</sentence><sentence id="206">And, so, the arrest came at night.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I must tell you that my father not only was a very known educator, but he had also written the books about the literature (ph) and was really known all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And the Nazis knew that he was quite ill already, so they let him be.</sentence><sentence id="209">But I remember one day an SS (ph) man coming to us and he said, "Just remember you better be very quiet because you are observed."</sentence><sentence id="210">And that we felt very</sentence><sentence id="212">much.</sentence><sentence id="213">But now, none of us has ever been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="214">So, we were very fortunate that way.</sentence><sentence id="215">And now, so, it was very difficult so far because what they did indirectly they tried to harm us.</sentence><sentence id="216">We didn't have too much money.</sentence><sentence id="217">To study in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very expensive.</sentence><sentence id="218">This was really a question of having money.</sentence><sentence id="219">And what they did is they simply cut out all the assistance, which otherwise gifted children and people who didn't have all the means to study, all this was cut away from us.</sentence><sentence id="220">Because they said, "Well, you are not Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="221">You're not in the Party.</sentence><sentence id="222">If you show us good will, we will help us."</sentence><sentence id="223">And that good will did not come forth.</sentence><sentence id="224">So, from there on really our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was more or less like a beehive.</sentence><sentence id="225">From morning to night -- and that started about in "34 -- we had children from all kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> whom we tutored.</sentence><sentence id="226">And this really could get the money for our daily living.</sentence><sentence id="227">Because the very same day when Hitler came to power, three SR (ph) men came through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my father and was to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">office school</span> -- and said "this is it", and led him out.</sentence><sentence id="228">It was a tremendous fortune that they didn't arrest him.</sentence><sentence id="229">We understood why they didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="230">My father was a very known educator all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because he had written quite a number of books.</sentence><sentence id="231">And to begin this, they went rather lightly on it, of the very prominent people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Was he a known anti-Nazi?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: He was a known Democrat.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Social Democrat?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yeah -- No, he was the Democratic Party.</sentence><sentence id="288">He was a very religious man.</sentence><sentence id="289">My mother was a very known Social Democrat.</sentence><sentence id="290">My father always called her his left wife, you know?(laughter) He was more . . .</sentence><sentence id="291">I think he was a thinker.</sentence><sentence id="292">He was a philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="293">A man who really stood for political and this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="294">He was an ethicist, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="295">A man we admired greatly.</sentence><sentence id="296">The good this was first he was invited out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">That had to be expected because they all knew where he stood.</sentence><sentence id="298">But the good thing that he wasn't arrested was that he, at that time, already had Parkinson's disease and was really rather ill.</sentence><sentence id="299">So, they left him alone.</sentence><sentence id="300">They even came one day and they said, "Well, at this point, we will leave you alone because you are rather known in the community" -- over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, really, his name -- "But we warn you.</sentence><sentence id="301">We warn you."</sentence><sentence id="302">With that they left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Dr. Zassenhaus, you had an incident in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: ... when the Nazis took over.</sentence><sentence id="325">Could you talk about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Very soon after Hitler came to power, the new order was passed.</sentence><sentence id="329">For now on, whenever a teacher entered the class at the end of six times every day -- different teachers - we had all to race and then we had to throw our right arm in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and shout as loud as we could, "Heil Hitler".</sentence><sentence id="330">Now don't forget, I was at that time about 15 or 16 years old.</sentence><sentence id="331">I immediately said, "That I can't do."</sentence><sentence id="332">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told my parents about the new order.</sentence><sentence id="333">I was very disturbed about it.</sentence><sentence id="334">I'd look at the faces and hope that they would give</sentence><sentence id="336">me some advice.</sentence><sentence id="337">I remember so very much my father said, "What will you do?"</sentence><sentence id="338">I said, "I will not do it."</sentence><sentence id="339">And he said, "Well, are you aware of the consequences?"</sentence><sentence id="340">And my mother said to me: "Hiltgunt, this is something you must decide for yourself."</sentence><sentence id="341">I never forgot that.</sentence><sentence id="342">And I looked at her, because somehow I hoped she would give me some advice.</sentence><sentence id="343">So, the next morning before I left, they asked me both, "What have you decided?"</sentence><sentence id="344">And I started to cry.</sentence><sentence id="345">I said, "Tell me."</sentence><sentence id="346">My father said very quietly, "You must decide this for yourself."</sentence><sentence id="347">It was one of the days which were very decisive in my life.</sentence><sentence id="348">| remember I come into <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">I was on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">All the girls knew about me.</sentence><sentence id="351">They knew because not -- I was not very important, but my father was rather known.</sentence><sentence id="352">Everybody knew where he stood.</sentence><sentence id="353">And know since the order had been passed.</sentence><sentence id="354">Whenever the teacher would enter, we would have to raise our right arm and shout, "Heil Hitler."</sentence><sentence id="355">And so the teacher comes in.</sentence><sentence id="356">I stood there, my arms glued at my sides.</sentence><sentence id="357">She beckoned me to her and she said, "Now as of tomorrow you will say "Heil Hitler" and you will raise your right arm.</sentence><sentence id="358">I give you 24 hours to think about it."</sentence><sentence id="359">That was one of the most upsetting days.</sentence><sentence id="360">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">I told my parents.</sentence><sentence id="362">I asked them, "What am I to do?</sentence><sentence id="363">What shall I do?"</sentence><sentence id="364">I never forgot the answer.</sentence><sentence id="365">My mother said, "You must decide for yourself."</sentence><sentence id="366">In the evening, I remember my father came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span> and he said, "Are you aware that whatever you do might be the end of your education?"</sentence><sentence id="367">I spent a sleepless night.</sentence><sentence id="368">I've never forgotten it.</sentence><sentence id="369">I still remember it as it was today.</sentence><sentence id="370">The next day I come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">All the students in my <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> they're very eager now they all knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="372">My father being so known, they wanted to what is she going to do.</sentence><sentence id="373">I remember as today, it was a beautiful day in Spring.</sentence><sentence id="374">The <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open.</sentence><sentence id="375">Everything was so beautiful <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">There was not a decision to make.</sentence><sentence id="377">And don't forget, I was just a very young person,</sentence><sentence id="379">probably very immature.</sentence><sentence id="380">The teacher comes in.</sentence><sentence id="381">All the heads, arms up.</sentence><sentence id="382">The heads all turn to me, what will she do?</sentence><sentence id="383">In my desperation, I raised my left arm and I put it right through the open <span class="DLF">window</span> until the glass broke.</sentence><sentence id="384">There was a general scream: "What has she done?"</sentence><sentence id="385">Blood poured from my arm.</sentence><sentence id="386">I was rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">That was the end of that story.</sentence><sentence id="388">And I must tell you, nobody ever looked into my direction.</sentence><sentence id="389">They just left me alone.</sentence><sentence id="390">Somehow, and as today after so many years, I think maybe it was very foolish.</sentence><sentence id="391">But somehow for me it was the beginning of the way I had to go.</sentence><sentence id="392">So many times now I think about it.</sentence><sentence id="393">Why did I do it?</sentence><sentence id="394">Why not just go along with that little?</sentence><sentence id="395">But, no, in retrospect I feel that was the decisive moment.</sentence><sentence id="396">I had to do what I later would do.</sentence><sentence id="397">The interesting thing is for now on, from then on, never anybody looked into my direction.</sentence><sentence id="398">They just let me do as odd ball (ph).</sentence><sentence id="399">They said hear no nothing, see no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="400">Since then, I passed my examination.</sentence><sentence id="401">They let me go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so that I could study later on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="480">Q: Why do you think they .. .</sentence><sentence id="481">Is it because of . . .?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: Certainly not for me.</sentence><sentence id="485">I think it was because of the reputation of my father.</sentence><sentence id="486">He was himself a very know educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="487">He had written books.</sentence><sentence id="488">Books which are still studied and learned about, learned from.</sentence><sentence id="489">And so I think it was really more a silent gist -- hear no nothing, see no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="490">So, they let me through.</sentence><sentence id="491">I passed my examination -- the only way I could to enter <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">However, my feelings, the feelings of my family, were exactly the same.</sentence><sentence id="493">I had the feeling I could not live any more in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="494">I would not be happy there any more.</sentence><sentence id="495">I just couldn't wait any more.</sentence><sentence id="496">So, what I decided is that I one day said I have somewhere to go that is next to me.</sentence><sentence id="497">And next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was really</sentence><sentence id="499"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">Not far away.</sentence><sentence id="501">About five hours away.</sentence><sentence id="502">This is where I went.</sentence><sentence id="503">This is how I started to get interested in the Scandinavian languages.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: The summer after high . ..</sentence><sentence id="529">When after I had my examination, it was really finished.</sentence><sentence id="530">So, that began the idea why shouldn't I study Scandinavian languages.</sentence><sentence id="531">Yes, and that is what I did.</sentence><sentence id="532">And that took off.</sentence><sentence id="533">Of course, at the time I had all my examination, my degree.</sentence><sentence id="534">And the amazing thing is now in retrospective, maybe really there is somebody higher than me who leads us to what we have to do.</sentence><sentence id="535">Because it was an outrageous idea to study Scandinavian languages.</sentence><sentence id="536">It's very rare, and really not much you could do with it.</sentence><sentence id="537">And my parents always asked me, "Is it really what you want to do?</sentence><sentence id="538">What will you really do with it?"</sentence><sentence id="539">Somehow I felt .. . [</sentence><sentence id="540">had been there on a visit that was a visit that was a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="541">I liked that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="542">There was no Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="543">So, here comes the war.</sentence><sentence id="544">Here come all the arrests of the Scandinavian people because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>, as you know.</sentence><sentence id="545">And, of course, the old principal of Hitler prevailed.</sentence><sentence id="546">He always arrested the elite of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to decapitate the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="547">That was a very cheap little trick to do, which it somehow always paralyzed people.</sentence><sentence id="548">So this elite now came to . . .</sentence><sentence id="549">I'm jumping now.</sentence><sentence id="550">I come now from "33 to the war -- to "39.</sentence><sentence id="551">And as soon as he invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>, the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="552">He goes to the elite.</sentence><sentence id="553">Spiritual (ph) elite was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="554">Anybody who resisted Hitler, they were arrested.</sentence><sentence id="555">And now they had the problem.</sentence><sentence id="556">They got them, brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where people simply were murdered.</sentence><sentence id="557">As you know, as we all know here.</sentence><sentence id="558">But they such overflow, and also there was one good thing for the Norwegian and</sentence><sentence id="560">0 Danish.</sentence><sentence id="561">They were non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="562">This idea of Hitler -- northern (ph) -- this idea.</sentence><sentence id="563">So, somehow that saved them from coming there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and being killed.</sentence><sentence id="564">They were sent to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">The <span class="BUILDING">German prisons</span> were no fun either, I can assure you.</sentence><sentence id="566">But yet they starved there.</sentence><sentence id="567">They were ill.</sentence><sentence id="568">But they were not murdered.</sentence><sentence id="569">And now these things where I come in.</sentence><sentence id="570">They needed now for these <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> somebody who spoke the Scandinavian languages.</sentence><sentence id="571">And here comes the mystery of life.</sentence><sentence id="572">Believe it or not I was the only person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had the necessary academic degrees for this.</sentence><sentence id="573">That I could work at the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">Supervise them, send out the mail (ph), send out anything, any outside connection they might have.</sentence><sentence id="575">Why would they be sent there in the first place?Why was no one killed?</sentence><sentence id="576">See, there was.</sentence><sentence id="577">In the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>, you didn't just kill people.</sentence><sentence id="578">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="579">So, they needed to do the academic way.</sentence><sentence id="580">And Hitler himself had to agree that I was the person, because I was the only one who had all the academic examinations in it.</sentence><sentence id="581">That was very important for that kind of position.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: And was your being a woman an issue?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: And the problem was of course the anger, deep anger of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="642">I was not only a woman, I was only a woman.</sentence><sentence id="643">That was very hard for them to swallow as I noticed in the years that follows --these four numb years where I know for now on traveled from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other in German whenever there was Scandinavian prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="644">What kind of prisoners were they?</sentence><sentence id="645">It was the elite of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because, as you know so well, Hitler's method was whenever he invaded another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, simply to arrest the elite in order to decapitate the leadership.</sentence><sentence id="646">It was an old trick I think that's been done for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="647">And</sentence><sentence id="649">1 he did that very skillfully.</sentence><sentence id="650">So, we had the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> full of the elite of all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> wherever he invaded.</sentence><sentence id="651">And people who resisted, who did anything of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="652">If you didn't do anything, you could probably get by pretty much.</sentence><sentence id="653">But you can imagine the spiritual elite this will always be in the leadership if ever it is to be offered.</sentence><sentence id="654">So that is how I came into this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="671">Q: What was the first job that you had?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: The first job was first they asked me to come into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">And then they saw, of course, affluent in Scandinavian languages.</sentence><sentence id="675">I had all my <span class="BUILDING">academia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="676">I was the only one.</sentence><sentence id="677">That was the aggravating thing.</sentence><sentence id="678">There was no other person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had that degree.</sentence><sentence id="679">And the much worse problem was I was only a woman.</sentence><sentence id="680">That was very hard for Hitler and his people to accept.</sentence><sentence id="681">But still it was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and it took a couple of months.</sentence><sentence id="682">These things are always slow, as you know.</sentence><sentence id="683">Yes, take her because we have nobody else.</sentence><sentence id="684">Now why did they at all allow people into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> in and out?</sentence><sentence id="685">See, there is again the German bureaucracy.</sentence><sentence id="686">You had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- and people usually don't know that in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- we had two ways of imprisonment.</sentence><sentence id="687">The one was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, which we all know about.</sentence><sentence id="688">That was simply, I mean, you were poisoned or you were hanged or you were killed.</sentence><sentence id="689">I mean, that was death by chance that somebody survived, as most of them were killed.</sentence><sentence id="690">But in the prisons of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was still a system.</sentence><sentence id="691">And there was still the German authority who had done it all their lives.</sentence><sentence id="692">This was done this way and this way.</sentence><sentence id="693">And lucky those, the elite, who were shipped off to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">Why were they shipped off there in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>?</sentence><sentence id="695">Because Hitler had somehow</sentence><sentence id="697">2 tend to adore all Norwish Aryan (ph) types.</sentence><sentence id="698">I guess it is known in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="699">And somehow it must be this.</sentence><sentence id="700">I mean, I cannot find any explanation.</sentence><sentence id="701">These people more or less were shipped off to the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="702">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were, of course, so filled already by all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that somehow the Norwish people lived, by this idea of Norwish are special.</sentence><sentence id="703">So, that's really probably saved their life.</sentence><sentence id="704">Now the situation in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> was awful.</sentence><sentence id="705">However, you did not have the Gestapo there.</sentence><sentence id="706">That's what people don't realize.</sentence><sentence id="707">There you still had the old functionaries, the old rules of <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="708">The people starved, they died of illnesses, but they were not put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">And also they had the old order.</sentence><sentence id="710">For example, they could write letters and they could also get once in awhile a visitor.</sentence><sentence id="711">And see this is where I came in.</sentence><sentence id="712">The Scandinavian ministers --they one day applied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="713">They wanted to visit the prisoners from time to time.</sentence><sentence id="714">And since again the Nazis had somehow an adoration of everything which was Norwish -- non-Jewish, you know?</sentence><sentence id="715">Norwish.</sentence><sentence id="716">He said yes, fine, they can do that, but only under strict supervision and only a person who is totally accepted and has all the examinations.</sentence><sentence id="717">And, believe it or not, the only person in all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was I who had this famous stand.</sentence><sentence id="718">It was a famous stand.</sentence><sentence id="719">And much to the horror of the Nazis, not only did I have this stand but I was only a woman, which was really an offense to them.</sentence><sentence id="720">But there you see again the German -- what should I say-- the stick stick to it.</sentence><sentence id="721">They wanted to have done by the letters in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">From there on for the next following four years during all the war time, I traveled from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="723">What was what I have to do?</sentence><sentence id="724">I had to send out all mail, which went out and in.</sentence><sentence id="725">Because, yes, in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>, the prisoners could send letters.</sentence><sentence id="726">But they were, of course, you should strike, strike out whatever you wanted not to be read.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="790">Q: You were a censor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="792">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="793">They told me to strike out as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="794">Whatever you don't like, you strike out.</sentence><sentence id="795">However, I was the only sender there, so I was the sender of a sender of myself.</sentence><sentence id="796">So, more or less I could really do this.</sentence><sentence id="797">And that is how it begun.</sentence><sentence id="798">I, little by little, only read the letter first.</sentence><sentence id="799">I didn't see the people.</sentence><sentence id="800">I only read the letter.</sentence><sentence id="801">And when I saw that a letter was too impersonal, too badly written by a prisoner, too much afraid, I put some things in.</sentence><sentence id="802">I put some little notes by myself.</sentence><sentence id="803">This and this, and everything is alright, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="804">I put that in.</sentence><sentence id="805">Of course, not in my own handwriting.</sentence><sentence id="806">I tried, at least, to do other hand writing.</sentence><sentence id="807">So, little by little.</sentence><sentence id="808">And then, of course, the good thing was I again had to send out also what came back.</sentence><sentence id="809">So that I struck out.</sentence><sentence id="810">So, I mean, it was very good.</sentence><sentence id="811">That went about almost a year.</sentence><sentence id="812">Then came the idea about there in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="813">Any prisoner is allowed to have so many visitors.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="836">Q: Could we go back for a moment?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="838">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="840">Q: Wasn't there, before you were doing those letters, at some point you were given a special assignment to get the letters from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that were going?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="842">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: Can you explain what you did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: That happened . . .</sentence><sentence id="854">since I had this examination, I was hired for the censorship between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">Both <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and, not <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="856">And so whatever I did not like, I found objectionably, I could strike out.</sentence><sentence id="857">You see?</sentence><sentence id="858">And so what I used to draw in the course of years -- not right a way of course -- but later on when I was feeding the Scandinavian prisoners, I'd send little notes to them and let them know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="859">Because I was the only one who sent out these letters.</sentence><sentence id="860">And that is the letters between the prisoners and the relatives.</sentence><sentence id="861">So I could do this.</sentence><sentence id="862">For example, it was very important for me to give them one message which was very harmless but of most important, most important.</sentence><sentence id="863">These prisoners really were starving to death.</sentence><sentence id="864">But since they were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, there was one rule.</sentence><sentence id="865">They could get every six months a peso (ph).</sentence><sentence id="866">And in that <span class="BUILDING">peso</span> (ph), they could have some chocolate, something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="867">What you say oh what does it mean every six months?</sentence><sentence id="868">Well, it was two pesos (ph) a year.</sentence><sentence id="869">It was some little light.</sentence><sentence id="870">And so what I did in my letters going to them with a thick (ph) hiding my own writing, I put to each "send pesos (ph), send pesos (ph)".</sentence><sentence id="871">Because the relatives didn't even know that, of course, that they could send pesos (ph).</sentence><sentence id="872">And very little, very fast where it goes.</sentence><sentence id="873">It took about three, four months.</sentence><sentence id="874">The first pesos (ph) arrived.</sentence><sentence id="875">The authorities were furious.</sentence><sentence id="876">They were furious because it was work to them.</sentence><sentence id="877">Why should we?</sentence><sentence id="878">But it was a rule.</sentence><sentence id="879">In these <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> there was rule they could have a peso (ph) twice a year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="914">Q: So, were you supposed to cross out. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="916">A: Exactly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="918">Q: ... ifa prisoner asked for something, you were supposed to cross it out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="920">A: That was the rule, idea now.</sentence><sentence id="921">I was asked whenever they would say send food, I should simply cross it out.</sentence><sentence id="922">The good thing was that I sent out the letters.</sentence><sentence id="923">Very soon, of course, I'm sure they were told you must not even ask for it, because it was not anywhere in it.</sentence><sentence id="924">But I would scribble it myself, "send food", in the letters. "</sentence><sentence id="925">Send food", you know, with a different handwriting of myself.</sentence><sentence id="926">It was reaching them and so the pesos (ph) kept on arriving.</sentence><sentence id="927">The authorities were furious and they came to me and complained.</sentence><sentence id="928">I said, well this is really unheard of, but if I were you a rule is a rule.</sentence><sentence id="929">Do you want to break a rule?That's fine by me.</sentence><sentence id="930">I don't mind.</sentence><sentence id="931">But it's your responsibility, of course.</sentence><sentence id="932">And, yeah, no we cannot break a rule.</sentence><sentence id="933">We have to give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="934">So, they got these pesos (ph).</sentence><sentence id="935">That was one good thing.</sentence><sentence id="936">They kept on hiding.</sentence><sentence id="937">Mind you, we had two systems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="938">That's very hard for people to understand.</sentence><sentence id="939">One was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where people simply were gassed or killed or starved.</sentence><sentence id="940">But the other was still a system with certain rules.</sentence><sentence id="941">This is where I had come in, fortunately, and could really do my part.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: How did you come to think of doing this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Well, that was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="972">I had studied Scandinavian languages.</sentence><sentence id="973">I loved <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="978">I don't mean that.</sentence><sentence id="979">I mean you were adding things.</sentence><sentence id="980">This was dangerous for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: Certainly it was dangerous for me.</sentence><sentence id="986">But you see, I was the only one who sent that .. .</sentence><sentence id="987">I was really in charge of the whole mail.</sentence><sentence id="988">And so the only thing I had to fear, of course, that somebody eventually would get the good idea to send the mail again.</sentence><sentence id="989">But they never did that.</sentence><sentence id="990">See, they were not all that smart as you think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="997">Q: Were you in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> alone?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: See, no, I put the letters from the prisoners mailed directly to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1001">Q: To your <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1003">A: To my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And then from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I mailed them back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and then they were mailed by postage over to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1005">But they also had to pass them the censorship.</sentence><sentence id="1006">See, the ordinary censorship.</sentence><sentence id="1007">But they again didn't know the rules of the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1008">So we had two forces working against each other, and it worked marvelously.</sentence><sentence id="1009">So, I was tremendous in hiding in different handwriting so that I had to be very careful because, you see, there were some people that might pick that up.</sentence><sentence id="1010">But it</sentence><sentence id="1012">7 worked.</sentence><sentence id="1013">Amazingly, it worked.</sentence><sentence id="1014">This went on for years.</sentence><sentence id="1015">That was one way I could help them.</sentence><sentence id="1016">But very soon fate came to me in the form that the counsels and the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>, the authorities, they started to talk with the German Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1017">They said, "Look, this is a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> our people are in.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Why can't they have visit from us?"</sentence><sentence id="1019">And so they asked at last, "Who is us?"</sentence><sentence id="1020">They said, "Well say, for example, two ministers could come.</sentence><sentence id="1021">Two people who are appointed by us."</sentence><sentence id="1022">They said, "Yes, we accept it.</sentence><sentence id="1023">That will be alright."</sentence><sentence id="1024">Because it was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1025">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1026">That was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tule</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1027">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, a rule is a rule.</sentence><sentence id="1028">They said, "But then we will have to have somebody who supervises these visits again who is on our side."</sentence><sentence id="1029">And this somehow, of course, had to know Scandinavian languages, had to be fluent in Norwegian and Danish.</sentence><sentence id="1030">And, you know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, again, it was .. .</sentence><sentence id="1031">that was not enough.</sentence><sentence id="1032">There were many people who spoke Danish and Norwegian, but you had to have the academic examination, a doctorate, the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="1033">And here I really can only thank God interfered.</sentence><sentence id="1034">I was the only person in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had that examination.</sentence><sentence id="1035">And I was only a woman.</sentence><sentence id="1036">That was very difficult to swallow for the authorities, but they had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="1037">The order had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Yes, that would be alright now.</sentence><sentence id="1039">Because it was a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1040">And from there on, for the following years and years and years, I would be the person totally in charge of the mailing, of the censorship, and of any visit they would get.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Now they would have to find people who would visit them.</sentence><sentence id="1042">There was a good thing that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is a <span class="DLF">seaport</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1043">We had always had a Norwegian and Danish pastor as evident.</sentence><sentence id="1044">Because he was there not for prisoners, but he was sent for the sailors, for the Norwegian and Danish sailors.</sentence><sentence id="1045">So, the news idea came from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Why don't we try to get these pastors there?</sentence><sentence id="1047">And so this happened.</sentence><sentence id="1050">8 One day, I get the visit of a Norwegian and of a Danish pastor.</sentence><sentence id="1051">They identified themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1052">They said to me, "We have gotten our permission."</sentence><sentence id="1053">It took them about months and months, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1054">But we have got the permission from the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> that we can visit the prisoner if you would be willing to take the censorship of the letters and of our visits.</sentence><sentence id="1055">And I said, "This is fine.</sentence><sentence id="1056">That can be done."</sentence><sentence id="1057">I said, "But I have to see how far this goes in my".</sentence><sentence id="1058">And so I contacted the authorities, the German authorities, and was very angry and said, "Now here's another work I have to do, and how would that work because I have soon had enough of it all."</sentence><sentence id="1059">And anyway I put my words in a way that they started to beg (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1060">They said, "Well, an order is an order, and you're the only person who can do it.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Couldn't you please help us out?"</sentence><sentence id="1062">I said, "Well, I don't really will so, but I will do it.</sentence><sentence id="1063">It will be my duty."</sentence><sentence id="1064">I said, "If that is what the authorities want, I will do it."</sentence><sentence id="1065">That was where it started.</sentence><sentence id="1066">From there on now, we had everything the way we wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="1067">To begin with, it was very amusing because these two pastors . .</sentence><sentence id="1068">.understand that these are two ministers very afraid of me.</sentence><sentence id="1069">And they mistrusted me.</sentence><sentence id="1070">I could very well understood this.</sentence><sentence id="1071">But it took about, I would say, 35 minutes, and they began to feel (laughter) . . .</sentence><sentence id="1072">they began to feel that this was alright.</sentence><sentence id="1073">From there on we started to do our work the following four years about.</sentence><sentence id="1074">We traveled first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1075">We saw first in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1076">But little by little, the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> were filled all the political prisoners from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Then we got the bombs.</sentence><sentence id="1078">We got <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> that were bombed out.</sentence><sentence id="1079">Little by little, they were all removed into all kinds of parts in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, away from where the main attacks were.</sentence><sentence id="1080">And so there it started now that we would have to travel from one <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to the other in the following years.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Officially, I was the supervisor of these two pastors who visited the prisoners.</sentence><sentence

class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, where she was a the first woman in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> took her full education, her full degree in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was very unusual at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1845">Fortunately, she met there the head of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and fell in love with him.</sentence><sentence id="1846">And that became my father.</sentence><sentence id="1847">So they married.</sentence><sentence id="1848">She never went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, which she actually had wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="1849">Don't forget, it was a different time.</sentence><sentence id="1850">My father very soon was called to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to a very prestigious <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there where he became the head.</sentence><sentence id="1851">Not only that, he also taught history and religion, and wrote the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which became a very important book and it's still read in the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">So that was a background I had.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I would say the ideas of Hitler were as far from our family as the moon.</sentence><sentence id="1854">And I remember so very well the very day, the 30th of January, when suddenly now through all the loud speakers -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span> we didn't have at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1855">Loudspeakers came "the Fuhrer has the power.</sentence><sentence id="1856">Adolf Hitler has come to power."</sentence><sentence id="1857">It was to us almost as somebody shook us and said "the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is on fire".</sentence><sentence id="1858">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1859">Especially we were four children.</sentence><sentence id="1860">I had three brothers, all one year</sentence><sentence id="1862">0 apart, and I was the young sister.</sentence><sentence id="1863">When my brother studied at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, I was still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">I remember as it had been today, although it was, I think, 200 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1865">Our parents assembled us all together at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and my father said, "From now on, things will be different.</sentence><sentence id="1866">Everything has changed."</sentence><sentence id="1867">And my mother added, "But one thing remains the same.</sentence><sentence id="1868">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, everything will be same.</sentence><sentence id="1869">We will be now one family who totally stands together.</sentence><sentence id="1870">But this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> has to become a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">Whatever you say <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, it has to be mainly in silence because somehow we have to try to survive."</sentence><sentence id="1872">And very well the next day we found out what she meant with it.</sentence><sentence id="1873">I woke up to a total dark room, although it was a light day.</sentence><sentence id="1874">I could not know what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1875">I saw at the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and a hush through the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And I saw all our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were sealed with swastikas, with paper, and darkened by that.</sentence><sentence id="1877">Because my father was a rather known educator in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who had written books about education and so they wanted to show us now what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1878">And if we didn't know, my father, of course, immediately was without a job.</sentence><sentence id="1879">He was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1880">At that time, he was already quite ill.</sentence><sentence id="1881">He had Parkinson's disease in a rather progressed shape already.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And I think that really saved his life.</sentence><sentence id="1883">He was so well-known a person that to begin with, the Nazis more or less tried to tread lightly.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And so they let him be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and let him die in peace.</sentence><sentence id="1885">A couple of months later, he was dead.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And now here my mother was with four children.</sentence><sentence id="1887">I was the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="1888">I was about 16 or 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="1889">I remember my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day.</sentence><sentence id="1890">The teacher, a wonderful teacher whom I adored, she taught us history.</sentence><sentence id="1891">She came into our <span class="BUILDING">class</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1892">She was very pale.</sentence><sentence id="1893">That is what I noticed immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And she said, "Well girls, I must tell you from now on everything will be different.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And the first thing I will tell you from now on whenever a teacher enters the class, you all have to get up.</sentence><sentence id="1896">You have to raise your</sentence><sentence id="1898">1 right arm and have to shout as loud as possible "Heil Hitler".</sentence><sentence id="1899">That's the way it will be."</sentence><sentence id="1900">I knew her well enough.</sentence><sentence id="1901">I saw the tears in her eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1902">I was disturbed by it.</sentence><sentence id="1903">Why would she even tell us that?</sentence><sentence id="1904">How could she tell us?</sentence><sentence id="1905">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1906">I was very upset.</sentence><sentence id="1907">I told my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1908">I saw they became very silent.</sentence><sentence id="1909">And somewhat later, they came to meant they said, "Well, what will you do?"</sentence><sentence id="1910">And I said, "Well, what am I to do?</sentence><sentence id="1911">What do you think I should do?</sentence><sentence id="1912">Give me advice.</sentence><sentence id="1913">I cannot raise my right arm.</sentence><sentence id="1914">I will not do this kind of thing."</sentence><sentence id="1915">And they said, "Well, I think we will all think about it somehow."</sentence><sentence id="1916">And so the next morning before I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, they came again to meant they said, "Now what have you decided?"</sentence><sentence id="1917">And I said, with tears in my eyes, "What do you think I should do?"</sentence><sentence id="1918">I was desperate.</sentence><sentence id="1919">It was probably one of the really most desperate days of my life, because my father looked very seriously at me and he said, "Hiltgunt, you must decide for yourself."</sentence><sentence id="1920">Totally in that moment, it was the first time that I really felt very alone.</sentence><sentence id="1921">So, I come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had my <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1922">It was a wonderful day in spring.</sentence><sentence id="1923">That was about when this order had been passed.</sentence><sentence id="1924">Simply for now on should all raise our and place our arm "hail Hitler".</sentence><sentence id="1925">The teacher enters the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>, the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open.</sentence><sentence id="1926">Now all these girls stood straight, raising their right arm.</sentence><sentence id="1927">Curious as they were and as much as these little girls were, they knew where I stood.</sentence><sentence id="1928">The heads all were bent to me.</sentence><sentence id="1929">What will she do?</sentence><sentence id="1930">And in my desperation, I took my left arm and I threw it through the open <span class="DLF">window</span>!</sentence><sentence id="1931">The glass fell, blood fell from my arm!</sentence><sentence id="1932">Here you see still the scar. (</sentence><sentence id="1933">laughter) I was rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to be sewed up.</sentence><sentence id="1934">And I must tell you, I still consider it the scar of my honor.</sentence><sentence id="1935">And from now on, I will tell you, nobody ever looked in my direction.</sentence><sentence id="1936">They simply left me alone.</sentence><sentence id="1937">And I stood there alone some down there and thought, well, well, but they didn't say anything, and just did nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1938">Really it was by the grace of God, or</sentence><sentence id="1940">2 maybe rather by the doubtless respect they had for my father who was really a known educator, that they simply overlooked me.</sentence><sentence id="1941">They let me be.</sentence><sentence id="1942">That was really the reason that I still was allowed to remain in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, that they simply ignored me.</sentence><sentence id="1943">That was the best they could.</sentence><sentence id="1944">The other way they would have simply would have to tell the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1945">They didn't do that, thanks to the reputation of my father.</sentence><sentence id="1946">I passed my examination and I was on my own.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2828">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2829">That was what I did because it's hard for you to imagine because even in this prison system here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, it certainly is not very comfortable because I have been visiting <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="2830">But certainly they get fed and, I mean, it's absolutely according to schedule and all this.</sentence><sentence id="2831">But there, it was really was so very little.</sentence><sentence id="2832">starved out.</sentence><sentence id="2833">I mean, they got rations.</sentence><sentence id="2834">It's hard for you to imagine.</sentence><sentence id="2835">Of course, don't forget you only hear about the people who survived.</sentence><sentence id="2836">You know, of course, of the2,000,000 of people who died.</sentence><sentence id="2837">And not only Jewish people, but many, many of our political prisoners from wherever.</sentence><sentence id="2838">Simply overstaffed finally, but there was a certain order in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> still.</sentence><sentence id="2839">It was a minimum.</sentence><sentence id="2840">A minimum of rationing, but it was so that they just could get by if they were strong.</sentence><sentence id="2841">So the young ones survived.</sentence><sentence id="2842">The older ones it was more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2843">And so what I felt I had to do when I was appointed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to this special situation, to supervise the visits my Scandinavian political prisoners got, I felt not only do I have to supervise there my way, that's not enough.</sentence><sentence id="2844">But I have also to give them help as much as I could.</sentence><sentence id="2845">And so I had a wonderful idea.</sentence><sentence id="2846">Everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was afraid of the air raids and that they would lose everything.</sentence><sentence id="2847">So, I had two very heavy pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2848">And each time when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, I filled my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> with bread, with vitamins, with anything possible to give them nourishment.</sentence><sentence id="2849">And I locked them in and that they never ask you to open it.</sentence><sentence id="2850">They couldn't because there again was the idea a very high position.</sentence><sentence id="2851">I was appointed directly by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2852">So whenever they even made a little ask what have you</sentence><sentence id="2854">5 there, I showed them my thing and they said, "Well, but all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2855">Why don't you leave it here?</sentence><sentence id="2856">We can keep it here."</sentence><sentence id="2857">I said, "Oh no, that goes right with me because if we are bombed, I will have my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2858">That is the last thing I have."</sentence><sentence id="2859">And they never dared.</sentence><sentence id="2860">And that is never anybody dared to say, "open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2861">Because one <span class="DLF">opening</span> they would have known what was in it, all these things for the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2862">Why did they not dare it?</sentence><sentence id="2863">Because I really had a very high position.</sentence><sentence id="2864">I was above them.</sentence><sentence id="2865">I came more or less as if you think your controller comes to control what you're doing.</sentence><sentence id="2866">So, that was really the tremendous blessing I had.</sentence><sentence id="2867">So isn't this awful how the one fooled the other?</sentence><sentence id="2868">That was the whole game the Gestapo played.</sentence><sentence id="2869">To some extent, they were afraid of me.</sentence><sentence id="2870">I was, of course, very much afraid of them.
