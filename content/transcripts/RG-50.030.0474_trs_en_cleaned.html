<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Now, explain why you say this is a Jewish Pope.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Because, at the time, the Pope in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avignon</span> protected the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="79">And they came to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avignon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">And that means that when the Germans asked about the Jews, you had to prove that you were a French Jew.</sentence><sentence id="81">And the French Jew had to have five generations.</sentence><sentence id="82">And five generations, you have to go way back to cover five generations, but it was easy for my mother because she was a Pope Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: She did work.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: So you felt secure at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Most.</sentence><sentence id="201">And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandparents is that my grandfather never allowed the name of his son pronounced in front of him the moment he left us, never.</sentence><sentence id="202">He... the mother was more tender-hearted and kept in touch.</sentence><sentence id="203">But he never would like to see the letters; he was not interested in ever hearing from that man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: So, did you think that your mother and her mother-in-law spoke about -- that her mother- in-law told your mother about what her son was doing?</sentence><sentence id="209">So she -- so your mother knew?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="212">Or do you think not?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: I don't think...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Oh, very much and intellectually.</sentence><sentence id="231">He -- my grandfather was for his job but extremely intellectual.</sentence><sentence id="232">He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times crossword puzzle.</sentence><sentence id="233">And then once a year, he would go -- he never went out; they were very sedentary.</sentence><sentence id="234">But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a competition and that made the money for the rest of the year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles.</sentence><sentence id="243">Either winning the competition -- that was a yearly thing -- or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them, for something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day.</sentence><sentence id="244">And that meant that he was encyclopedique.</sentence><sentence id="245">When he died, there was a fight over who would get his dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot.</sentence><sentence id="246">He trained us, he teached us in Latin, in French.</sentence><sentence id="247">He had groups of our little friends come every... once a week to study with him and he was great.</sentence><sentence id="248">I mean, they were just great.</sentence><sentence id="249">And it was very, very modest life.</sentence><sentence id="250">They did not have any hot water.</sentence><sentence id="251">They did not have any running water except in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucet</span> in the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see now, people collect them.</sentence><sentence id="253">But for us it was a necessity of life.</sentence><sentence id="254">You had to heat your water and then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: But not on a regular basis?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Oh no, it was not at all.</sentence><sentence id="281">Because the caste system is such in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that you live ina different part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, you never, never...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: So explain this caste system, as you understand it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Well, you have the working class; we had nothing to do with that.</sentence><sentence id="292">We were bourgeois poor, but we had a maid.</sentence><sentence id="293">We always had a maid.</sentence><sentence id="294">It was done that way.</sentence><sentence id="295">And she had what is now the <span class="INT_SPACE">students" quarters</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we used to live, because they had the, had the view.</sentence><sentence id="296">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">All that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was maids.</sentence><sentence id="298">And now it's all students and they all fight...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: Uh-huh, but you can wear other people's...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2654">8 Tape #4</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2659">Q: Nicole I, I don't want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942, because I'm not sure anybody's memory can be clear about when things happened.</sentence><sentence id="2660">But do you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you moved out from your mother, or was it... do you think it was later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2663">A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it.</sentence><sentence id="2664">Because I used not to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, as I told you, not to come back to that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, not to involve her, not to have her know about my activities.</sentence><sentence id="2665">And so... And also for the date, I know that what really shook me was that Vel d'Hiv... when the word came out, and it came out, not that I saw the inside of the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so close to were everybody lived.</sentence><sentence id="2666">And at that point, I thought I had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2667">But I just sort of had to do something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2673">Q: More than what you were doing? "</sentence><sentence id="2674">Cause you obviously were doing something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2677">A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2679">Q: Then that bothered you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2681">A: ... which was late, then I had to step in and do something.</sentence><sentence id="2682">Because I was in a unique <span class="NPIP">position</span> to probably be able to do something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2685">Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that they were going to take children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2687">A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had -- thanks again to the organization of the German -- an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the addresses of the specific raids.</sentence><sentence id="2688">And that's the way I knew where to go to get the children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2691">Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew?</sentence><sentence id="2692">Were they in some sense assisting with the Nazis?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2695">A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="2696">It probably was.</sentence><sentence id="2697">There was a point there where it was unhealthy.</sentence><sentence id="2698">But for my sake, it was practical.</sentence><sentence id="2699">I think after the war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the relationship that they maybe shouldn't have had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2705">Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2707">A: I guess that's the way I got it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2709">Q: You think that's the way it came?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2715">A: Because there was no other way I could get it.</sentence><sentence id="2716">And I know of what transpired after the war about the U.G.LF and how close they were with the Germans, because they knew of the German work as it took place.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2719">Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going to do something?</sentence><sentence id="2720">I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2725">A: Probably, probably.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2727">Q: But you don't...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2729">A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder.</sentence><sentence id="2730">You do it and then that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2731">I thought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never thought of it.</sentence><sentence id="2732">Definitely normal behavior.</sentence><sentence id="2733">What are we going to do?</sentence><sentence id="2734">Sit back and let it be.</sentence><sentence id="2735">So, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the type of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2736">And I was in an unusual position that I could do something.</sentence><sentence id="2737">Because of the way the French government was going to protect me, one way or the other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2747">Q: So you felt...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2749">A: Compelled.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2751">Q: [Coughs] I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2752">You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the French government would protect you, which didn't mean that you were totally protected because the Germans might do something, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2755">A: Well...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2757">Q: There was some danger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2759">A That came, that came -- for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that moment on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the <span class="DLF">compartment door</span>, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or whoever it was that I was transporting -- and it was a kid capable of talking -- had given out anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead -- I was just as good as dead at that point.</sentence><sentence id="2760">So, when I went into it, I didn't know the extent of the danger and most of the time, probably, I wasn't discovered, so there was no danger.</sentence><sentence id="2761">It worked well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2765">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2766">But now you're doing this in connection with the underground group that you...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2769">A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2771">Q: So, it's a different group.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2777">A: Completely different.</sentence><sentence id="2778">That had to do with the Jewish U.G.LF.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2783">A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2784">Because otherwise I would not know where they were to be had, to start with, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> being a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2787">Q: So this was a Jewish underground...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2789">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2791">Q: .. organization that you were connected with.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2793">A: It wasn't really underground.</sentence><sentence id="2794">It was the Jewish... administration of the Jews, at the time...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2797">Q: The U.G.LF.,</sentence><sentence id="2798">yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the Germans... You were not doing this openly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2801">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2803">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2805">A: And the only people that would have any inkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was the Jewish organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2807">Q: So your mother -- You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people you were going to be taken.</sentence><sentence id="2808">And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at once?</sentence><sentence id="2809">Or they were taking a few at a time that they...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2813">A: They came, they came individually.</sentence><sentence id="2814">They would come to your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and ring, and if the bell rang at four o'clock in the morning, you knew who it was.</sentence><sentence id="2815">And what happened is that after the Vel d'Hiv -- this is when the Vel d'Hiv come in -- they would not anymore -- I didn't see it in the book -- but they would not anymore tackle young children.</sentence><sentence id="2816">So, the Germans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands.</sentence><sentence id="2817">Because it created such an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would rebel against them.</sentence><sentence id="2818">So, in some ways, I was in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="2819">It was a sort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things.</sentence><sentence id="2820">It was some very shady participation there.</sentence><sentence id="2821">"Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that happened at the very specific date. "</sentence><sentence id="2822">Enough with the babies!</sentence><sentence id="2823">If there's one thing that we don't need in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, it's that problem."</sentence><sentence id="2824">And I stepped in and took that problem away from their hands.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2837">Q: Was anyone else doing it, do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2839">A: That I would...not that I know of.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2848">Q: Not that you know of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2850">A: I never mentioned it and nobody mentioned it to me.</sentence><sentence id="2851">It was rare... It could have been obvious, you know, all those people taking a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2854">Q: So, let's talk about the process, you get names, and you...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2858">Q: Addresses.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2860">A: Times, times, time, I guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2862">Q: These people did not necessarily expect you.</sentence><sentence id="2863">You're just, you're just as surprising as the Germans knocking.</sentence><sentence id="2864">For a different reason, but you're a surprise to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2868">A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal experience, do not give away their children.</sentence><sentence id="2869">So I had some persuading to do to them, which was the difficult part.</sentence><sentence id="2870">It was in two parts: first, "This is it, you are doomed".</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2874">Q: You would tell them that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2876">A: I don't know how I did, but I passed on that message. "</sentence><sentence id="2877">As far as you are concerned, let it be, there is nothing anybody can do.</sentence><sentence id="2878">But there's something that that German soldier is going to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child is safe."</sentence><sentence id="2879">And then I would get the child.</sentence><sentence id="2880">And the same day, he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, he or she, I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2886">Q: Did you usually have one child?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2910">Q: But how long would it take you to convince people usually?</sentence><sentence id="2911">You would sit there for an hour, two hours or much less?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2914">A: [Scoffs] No, much less.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2916">Q: You don't have that much time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2918">A: Much less, the Germans are not going to let me.</sentence><sentence id="2919">They don't have the message.</sentence><sentence id="2920">I have the message from the Germans at large; they don't.</sentence><sentence id="2921">So they are brutal.</sentence><sentence id="2922">They, they want the whole thing finished and also maybe they have some human feeling that the whole thing is ugly, so they want it over with.</sentence><sentence id="2923">So, I don't have much problem with them, I have the problems with the woman.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2930">Q: You don't have problems with whom?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2932">A: With the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2933">The Germans have been given the message: "No children, no dealing with children under the age of three".</sentence><sentence id="2934">So, I had no problem with the German at that point.</sentence><sentence id="2935">Iam in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in nowhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, usually a poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, not especially a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> and confronting a woman, and that's the woman that is the problem or could be the problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2940">Q: Is the husband usually there, or not...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2942">A: No, there were no men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2950">A: Women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2952">Q: So, would it be very often very quickly that the people would say, "Okay, take the child"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2954">A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germans come in, they had a feeling that... of the ugliness of it.</sentence><sentence id="2955">Even if they were uncultured and uninformed, they would sense the enormity of it and it wouldn't be a battle.</sentence><sentence id="2956">I don't remember a battle.</sentence><sentence id="2957">And then you would have to get the identity of the child in order to after the war to be careful to have kept track.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2962">Q: Of who the child was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2964">A: Of who the child was!</sentence><sentence id="2965">And at that point, he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, the child was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2966">And that's when another battle started with the Italians.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2985">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="2986">They would... all of the mothers would give a chance to the child.</sentence><sentence id="2987">Immediately... what happened was that immediately they realized that there was no chance for them... with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2988">There was no chance for them and if they took the child with them, I told them in no uncertain terms "That child will not save you.</sentence><sentence id="2989">The fact that you have a child even at the breast will not save you."</sentence><sentence id="2990">And the, the ugliness of the German soldiers was such that they felt it.</sentence><sentence id="2991">And that I came from the, probably, I don't remember, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was reassuring for them.</sentence><sentence id="2992">I had their identity, I had their card, and they trusted it.</sentence><sentence id="2993">And then they were, were in such a....state that they had to trust somebody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3003">Q: Did you, by this time, understand sort of what was happening, that these people would be killed?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3029">Q: You did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3031">A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the...because of the confrontation between the German soldier and the, and the women, I had the feeling that it was going to be very ugly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3033">Q: Now, do I understand you that the German was there with you sometimes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A: They, they were arresting the women.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3049">Q: Oh, oh, I see...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3051">A: Because otherwise, the kid would not be left behind in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> all by himself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3053">Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to the Germans, that you would try to beat the timing of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3054">So you're there just as the German...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3057">A: I wouldn't have had a chance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3059">Q: Because the mothers wouldn't do it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3061">A: They wouldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3062">But when they see -- saw the Germans come for the family and they're willing to let go of the child.</sentence><sentence id="3063">Then they realize the danger they were in, and they were willing to let go of the child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
