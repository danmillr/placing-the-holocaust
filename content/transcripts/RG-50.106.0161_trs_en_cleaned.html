<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: When you were a child, did you personally ever see Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Never saw him, but when we were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the Nazis would come by and make sure that we were sitting at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> in our best clothes, listening to the speeches.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: When you think back to your childhood, can you remember any personal experiences that you had with anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, things began to boil up very quickly after Hitler took power.</sentence><sentence id="18">The people who owned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, their o -- late teens to early 20's sons were among the first je -- to join the party.</sentence><sentence id="19">They paraded around in their brown shirts.</sentence><sentence id="20">Some of the children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> joined the Hitlerjugend, the Hitler Youth.</sentence><sentence id="21">And of course there was always the spectacle of the marches up and down.</sentence><sentence id="22">We lived on the corner of a main <span class="DLF">street</span>, and the spectacle of the parades up and down with the flags, the music, the torches, and get away from that <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">The atmosphere of fear.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Was there any explanation for this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: That was the way it was done.</sentence><sentence id="56">I was young enough not to know any real reason.</sentence><sentence id="57">The other <span class="NPIP">thing</span> was the so-called Winterhilfe.</sentence><sentence id="58">Once a week people were required to have a meal that was prepared in one pot, and the amount of money that was saved, presumably, by having a thick soup or something of that sort, was to be given to the poor.</sentence><sentence id="59">During the winter the Nazis would come knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, peek in the pots, and collect what you presumably saved.</sentence><sentence id="60">To this day I do not like to eat pea soup or lentil soup, for that reason.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Why was he fired?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: For being Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: When you think back to the events when Hitler came to power, do you remember some of the first signs that things were changing?</sentence><sentence id="84">Do you remember it <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in any way, or all of a sudden is it just in your mind as all around you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Once he decided it was time to go, what efforts did he make to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

And they invited my father to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, look around for a few weeks and see if it was possible to come and possibly make a living and then decide to apply for a visa.</sentence><sentence id="101">And they then signed an affidavit for us that permitted us to come into this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: How long did the process take from when he first decided to come until you got the paperwork all in order?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Probably something over a year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: During this time did anyone try to stop you or make it difficult for you to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: I don't really know about that, there are family members who said, oh don't just run off, it's going to stop, it will all be over.</sentence><sentence id="115">And my father said, I don't think it will stop.</sentence><sentence id="116">And he made up his mind and he is fortunate, some members of his family were fortunate to get out.</sentence><sentence id="117">Others were not so fortunate, were lost.</sentence><sentence id="118">Both my father's family and mother's family.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: I would say it was just more of the same.</sentence><sentence id="127">More of the marches up and down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, more of your child laughed at that -- a-a-at our man in uniform, you're gonna get in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="128">Or just watch very carefully where you walk, how you walk.</sentence><sentence id="129">Stay out of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="130">Just don't call attention to yourself in any way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: What was happening in your life during this time, before you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in that year, or a little more than a year from when Hitler came to power, until you left.</sentence><sentence id="137">What were you doing in your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: I was a school kid, and some of the families there were also hoping to get out.</sentence><sentence id="141">But o-others were still ready to tough it out and see what would happen.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: You mentioned before that you went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, did I hear you correctly?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="147">The <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were both burned down later on Kristallnacht.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: But while you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was there any problem with attending a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: No, it was not shut down until after I had left.</sentence><sentence id="153">And at that time my teacher made it her business to teach those children that were still there even after the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="154">She taught them in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Juden house</span> and then she began smuggling them, at great risk to herself, across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.418929" long="7.246707">Bochum</span> is not far from the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">And she managed to get out quite a number of -- of children, although she herself was later deported and died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
