<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, I entered <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> like all children at age six, and I think I hated <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from the first day I went there.</sentence><sentence id="53">It was made ever more difficult, because the teacher we had was even then a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="54">And I was a child that couldn't sit still, and had my mouth open probably all the time.</sentence><sentence id="55">And was punished for it a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="56">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="57">It did not improve my love for <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: Did you have friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="65">Were they Jewish friends?</sentence><sentence id="66">Christian friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I had a lot of friends in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">I think we were the only class, first grade class, at the time we were 24 children.</sentence><sentence id="72">Out of the 24, 12 were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="73">Fifty percent!</sentence><sentence id="74">It was an extremely high percentage.</sentence><sentence id="75">I think that was the only class ever that had such a high percentage of Jewish students.</sentence><sentence id="76">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until 1936 when Jewish children were no longer allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> unless their parent or their fathers were in the First World War and were in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">These were the exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="78">So I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in 1936, and I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until Easter of 1940."</sentence><sentence id="79">So I really didn't have a hell of a lot of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">And after, I would say 1938, after Kristallnacht", due to the fact that we had so many Jewish -- old Jewish teachers that were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for many weeks and months, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was every other day two hours for many months until everybody had come back and there was a semblance of a normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Would you tell me a little bit about after 1933, "34.</sentence><sentence id="93">How, besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, how did life change for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, I would first like to go back before 1933.</sentence><sentence id="97">We lived and had our <span class="BUILDING">business</span> next to a <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">This <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span> was a left-wing newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="99">And we had daily street fights, mob scenes, shooting, flag burning.</sentence><sentence id="100">These are the first of my memories as a child <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">It was a very violent <span class="DLF">street</span> we lived on.</sentence><sentence id="102">These are really my first memories and my mother or someone from the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> pulling me back from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and as soon as they turned their backs, my brother and I were back out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> watching what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="103">These are really my first memories.</sentence><sentence id="104">One of my other memories is the boycott of April 1933 where our <span class="DLF">show windows</span> were plastered with "Jew!" "</sentence><sentence id="105">Don't go to the Jew!"</sentence><sentence id="106">And so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="107">These are really some of my childhood memories.</sentence><sentence id="108">Family life was great.</sentence><sentence id="109">Outside the family, it was not so good.</sentence><sentence id="110">You were insulted in the <span class="DLF">street</span> many times.</sentence><sentence id="111">You were called "dirty Jew," things like that.</sentence><sentence id="112">For several years, I did have Gentile girlfriends and, of course, under the pressure of the Nazi time they could no longer associate with me, and I would not dare associate with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Were you taunted by your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mates?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: By some of them.</sentence><sentence id="133">And like my husband, I beat up one.</sentence><sentence id="134">And not only did I beat her, I actually tore her sweater to pieces.</sentence><sentence id="135">I was not standing, you know, not letting it happen to me all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: As the Nazi regime went on, what else happened to you and your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, as time when on, of course, there was Kristallnacht. []</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Tell me about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="147">" The interviewee later corrected this date to 1939.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="148">&gt; Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Kristallnacht, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> obviously, and something seemed wrong, yet I didn't know what.</sentence><sentence id="150">And when I came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I mentioned that I saw the fire engines standing in front of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and in the back of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span>, I was told, "Don't you know what's going on?"</sentence><sentence id="151">And I said, "No, I don't."</sentence><sentence id="152">She said -- this one told me, "My father was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="153">His father was arrested, and it was just a terrible situation."</sentence><sentence id="154">The teachers, other than the female teachers, did not come in.</sentence><sentence id="155">They were arrested.</sentence><sentence id="156">And they sent us <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I think, after about two hours.</sentence><sentence id="157">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all our <span class="DLF">show windows</span> had been smashed.</sentence><sentence id="158">My mother was sweeping up the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="160">To the taunts and harassment of the population or the people who were made to look like the population.</sentence><sentence id="161">Next to us was a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that dealt in oriental carpets.</sentence><sentence id="162">The <span class="DLF">show window</span> is gone.</sentence><sentence id="163">Ink thrown over the carpets.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was, it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="165">The only reason our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and business was not touched at the time was that they simply knew there was not a man to be arrested, so our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and our business upstairs remained in tact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: What did your family do after Kristallnacht?</sentence><sentence id="184">How did you mother manage?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Well, we managed first of all to take care of a lot of customers at the time because every Jew needed an identification paper.</sentence><sentence id="188">To these purpose, you had to have a picture.</sentence><sentence id="189">The picture had to show your left ear.</sentence><sentence id="190">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="191">So that every person had to be taken -- the picture had to be taken from this <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">Your ear was supposedly an additional identification mark.</sentence><sentence id="193">Another harassment.</sentence><sentence id="194">And so we were really very busy in the business until the very end, until we absolutely closed on the 31st of December.</sentence><sentence id="195">And, since I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I helped in the business as people drifted back or came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, many times their first stop was really with us because they were so afraid they had to get the identification paper, the photos and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="196">I saw many men with their ears frozen, their hands frozen.</sentence><sentence id="197">My mother would run pots of soup to feed these people first before they would go wherever they needed, you know, went.</sentence><sentence id="198">It was a very hard, very busy time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: What happened after that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Nineteen thirty-nine, the three sisters of my mother who also had to close their business moved in with us because we had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">Obviously, we shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">Half was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, half was business.</sentence><sentence id="216">So there were all these empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, so my aunts moved in with us because there was no more income so you had to reduce your living expenses.</sentence><sentence id="217">My grandmother had moved in with us after my brother left in 1937 because she was very old.</sentence><sentence id="218">She could no longer keep a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> of her own.</sentence><sentence id="219">And so here were six women in one <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">Not necessarily an ideal situation, but it functioned somehow.</sentence><sentence id="221">When the war broke out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was on the list of evacuation.</sentence><sentence id="222">In other words, most of the population, meaning people with small children and very old people, were evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="223">And so we evacuated my grandmother, of all <span class="NPIP">places</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">And many people went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.776443" long="9.179887">Stuttgart</span>, other <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could go; my mother decided she was not going to leave.</sentence><sentence id="225">And my mother's three sisters decided they were not going to go anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="226">We were going - - just going to stay where we were.</sentence><sentence id="227">My grandmother we sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> because it was very hard to move her in any emergency.</sentence><sentence id="228">She was 90 years old, and so she was away from us for maybe four or five months, and then we took her back because there was actually no war.</sentence><sentence id="229">There was war, but there was no shooting.</sentence><sentence id="230">There was nothing going on.</sentence><sentence id="231">So what then was called "Drdele de Guerre," and, and so we took her back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">This went, of course, until the day we were deported on the 22nd of October 1940.</sentence><sentence id="233">I would like to interject that in the spring of 1940 I was for four months in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, where my mother had sent me, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> if you wish.</sentence><sentence id="234">It taught agriculture and horticulture and all sorts of things and my mother sent me up there because she didn't know what to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="235">I was hanging around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">There was nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="237">I could not do any apprenticeship of any kind and so I was up there for four months and, I think it was four months, maybe five, and then I came back, I think, in August of 1940 because she was not feeling well.</sentence><sentence id="238">And so I came back.</sentence><sentence id="239">And then we, of course, were deported in October.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Would you describe the process of that deportation?</sentence><sentence id="268">How were you notified and what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: My mother went out shopping early in the morning, as a matter of fact, and she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a hurry and said, "I met someone in the <span class="DLF">street</span> who told me that we would be deported.</sentence><sentence id="272">Said everybody would be arrested and deported."</sentence><sentence id="273">She did not believe it and she went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, which was only two blocks away from us.</sentence><sentence id="274">And sure enough the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were closed, and then it dawned on her that there was something to this story.</sentence><sentence id="275">And she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she told me, "Well, I guess we better start packing."</sentence><sentence id="276">And before she had finished the sentence, the police was there and told us that we are arrested.</sentence><sentence id="277">No, the first thing she did was, "If we really have to go I have very good friends and I promised them certain items from our <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">Take them over there.</sentence><sentence id="279">Go over there.</sentence><sentence id="280">Take it, take it over there.</sentence><sentence id="281">Give it to them."</sentence><sentence id="282">And I went and it turned out that this lady's husband was really German underground.</sentence><sentence id="283">He was a lawyer, but he must have been busy in the German underground because he knew exactly where we were going to be taken.</sentence><sentence id="284">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="285">The man was later on the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> right after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: What's his name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: So he was, he was very clean.</sentence><sentence id="304">Was Mr. Veit.</sentence><sentence id="305">His name was Veit.</sentence><sentence id="306">They were very good friends of my mother.</sentence><sentence id="307">And so I took the items, and by the time I came back the police was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> telling us to pack and, and so my mother started.</sentence><sentence id="308">And the policeman knew my mother very well.</sentence><sentence id="309">He was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">precinct</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">And he said to my mother, "I will see if I can get your mother-in-law to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you cannot be moved out of your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> &gt; Funny war (French); The Phony War.</sentence><sentence id="311">until I come back."</sentence><sentence id="312">Now he knew very well that no Jewish people were accepted at this particular day in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">So he gave us two hours to pack.</sentence><sentence id="314">So I packed everything for my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="315">My mother packed for me and for herself and my aunts, of course, packed for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="316">And so six women were eventually guarded by 12 Gestapo and policemen.</sentence><sentence id="317">Six helpless women.</sentence><sentence id="318">Right!</sentence><sentence id="319">I was 16 and my grandmother was 91 and a half.</sentence><sentence id="320">Totally not comprehending what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="321">Not that she was senile.</sentence><sentence id="322">It was simply, it was something that was incomprehensible.</sentence><sentence id="323">And so we had to sign papers stating how much the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was worth.</sentence><sentence id="324">My aunt first refused and she was threatened that she would be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, and so she signed.</sentence><sentence id="325">And we had to leave and we were loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where everybody slowly was assembled.</sentence><sentence id="326">And I believe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> had some 930 or 950 Jews that were deported together.</sentence><sentence id="327">All together from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Palatinate</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">There were some Jews from the Saar that were also deported with us, only a few.</sentence><sentence id="329">It was 6,500 people, I believe, that were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="330">The ride to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> was horror.</sentence><sentence id="331">It was absolute horror.</sentence><sentence id="332">My husband has explained to you, each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> had a person in charge for each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and then someone was put in charge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">They really had nothing to say until the Germans turned us over to the French.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Why was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride a horror?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: It was a horror insofar as we had no food or barely any food was given to us.</sentence><sentence id="369">I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">For the first time we were given some sort of soup and maybe some bread.</sentence><sentence id="371">Two of the old people, my grandmother being one of them, lost their minds.</sentence><sentence id="372">Most probably due to hunger and the strain and stress and eventually, there was a doctor on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, the last doctor that I knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> and he gave me a handful of sleeping pills to give to my grandmother and I did.</sentence><sentence id="373">And it really meant, "Put her to sleep, let her go."</sentence><sentence id="374">She didn't.</sentence><sentence id="375">And at the end of the ride, when we came to Oloron-Sainte-Marie; because she was totally confused.</sentence><sentence id="376">So was the other man, a Mr. Weil.</sentence><sentence id="377">She was taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and disappeared for at least a week.</sentence><sentence id="378">We did not know where she was.</sentence><sentence id="379">My mother offered to go, asked if she could go with this old woman and was refused.</sentence><sentence id="380">And for at least a week or two we did not know where she was.</sentence><sentence id="381">We never knew where she was.</sentence><sentence id="382">All of a sudden we were told that she was in the next <span class="DLF">block</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">She must have been in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or someplace because when she came back, she was okay.</sentence><sentence id="384">She knew us.</sentence><sentence id="385">She could not understand her <span class="NPIP">surroundings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">Obviously, who could?</sentence><sentence id="387">But she was okay.</sentence><sentence id="388">She was no longer confused.</sentence><sentence id="389">So you can understand that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, aside from everything else, was horror.</sentence><sentence id="390">My mother's sisters were -- the oldest was very ill and had diabetes, was in her 70s so the ages were great and having two people in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, not in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> going -- losing their minds the same way was a little tough.</sentence><sentence id="391">When we arrived in Oloron- Sainte-Marie, as my husband mentioned to you before, it rained buckets.</sentence><sentence id="392">It rained.</sentence><sentence id="393">It was incredible.</sentence><sentence id="394">We were loaded mostly on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when we atrived, it was evening and, of course, total bedlam and confusion.</sentence><sentence id="396">And the adults, and we were teenagers at the time, were totally traumatized and in shock and functioned barely.</sentence><sentence id="397">And so it was on us, the young, to get some semblance of -- you can't say order -- but there was a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they were giving out straw.</sentence><sentence id="398">So we ran to get straw so the people at least could sleep on straw.</sentence><sentence id="399">My husband was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="400">He had even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> or whatever he called it.</sentence><sentence id="401">Later on, we were given stuff to put the straw in to make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">But the first few nights we had straw and not even enough of that because some people really did sleep on the bare <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">And for the very old people it was just awful.</sentence><sentence id="404">A young person can always shift, but very old people, it is very hard.</sentence><sentence id="405">So it was the young people who had to function first and did function first.</sentence><sentence id="406">And slowly, you know, things started to fall into a pattern.</sentence><sentence id="407"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> full of mud.</sentence><sentence id="408">It was clay.</sentence><sentence id="409">When it rained, you sank into the clay up to your knees.</sentence><sentence id="410">The first persons we lost, or one woman we lost really choked to death in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="411">She went at night to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="412">She fell.</sentence><sentence id="413">She could not extricate herself and she died.</sentence><sentence id="414">So our experiences were horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="415">It is not -- I would not say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but it was what they called "the Little <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> before the Big One," meaning <span

are Jews?</sentence><sentence id="853">We don't know what that is, but would you rather have a glass of wine."</sentence><sentence id="854">And we in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> hoped they would say no, because it was a little bit tight in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armoire</span> and so eventually they left and we could come out.</sentence><sentence id="855">So we were very, very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="856">And four weeks later, we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="857">The razzias had stopped for the moment and
