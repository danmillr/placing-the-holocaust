<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And will you now give us a little background of your childhood, growing up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, I...in 1914, when I was 7 years old, my father and five children were already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and they sent passports to my mother and the other four children, including me, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">Because of the war we could not go into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so we were stuck.</sentence><sentence id="11">By early 1915, as the Germans approached our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we had to flee for our lives.</sentence><sentence id="12">So I recall how the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we left on an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal car</span> in the rain not knowing where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="13">We came to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> and there the whole...other people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were marched to the central square...square where there were three <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">We spent a few nights in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> which were filled with refugees and what few belongings they had, and my mother find a relative and we moved into a crowded, small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we stayed for at least 6 months or longer because I recall I went to <span class="BUILDING">Cheder</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">When things got so bad that we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for a piece of black bread with Zeppelins overhead, my courageous mother took her four children and we started a journey in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">I don't...I'm sure she didn't know where we're gonna end up, and the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> took us across <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, and into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ha Binh</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbin</span>" at least for 4, 5 months.</sentence><sentence id="18">We finally made contact with the family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and once contacts were made through an uncle of mine...he who was one of the founders of the UJA, very prominent in Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">A man named Abe Edelberg.</sentence><sentence id="20">Uncle Abe arranged for us to try to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbine</span>, and we then traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbine</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>, and then we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> for a little while and then we sailed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> on February 12, 1917.</sentence><sentence id="21">From there, we traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to...overnight stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span>, <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>, where we joined my grandparents and my family.</sentence><sentence id="22">So that my first years, my early life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> where I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">In 1930...uh...in 1926, I entered Franklin and Marshall College, graduated in 1930, was admitted to the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, which is no longer in existence.</sentence><sentence id="24">And at the end of my first year, I was offered a job with the Jewish Board of Guardians, which was then the largest <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Psychiatric Clinic</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25">I spent 6 years with the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">In 41, I took a civil service exam for parole officer, started as a parole officer by "41.</sentence><sentence id="27">I had to beat everybody in the state, and was appointed to the position of executive case supervisor, and I had that job "til "43.</sentence><sentence id="28">In 1943, one of my brothers was involved in very important war work.</sentence><sentence id="29">Sol, I left the division and went to work with him, and at the end of the war in "45, the American Jewish Joint Distribution "located approx.</sentence><sentence id="30">800 km north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pyongyang</span> in the <span class="REGION">Heilonjiang Province</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchuria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">Committee issued an appeal for social workers to work <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">So I got a job with the Joint, as it was known, and after a month's indoctrination or so, I was sent to Europe and I was member of the first group of Jewish social workers that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work with the survivors of the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: When you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, originally I understand my orders were to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">I might say that when I got to Europe, we spent a week or so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and nobody really knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> where I was supposed to work, but reports came in that there were hundreds of Jews in trouble and needing food, clothing, and so forth in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">So I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">I found these Jews and they needed...they weren't registered with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>"".</sentence><sentence id="65">So it was a question of getting them jobs, getting them food, and getting them registered and later on helping them to meet their needs.</sentence><sentence id="66">So I began to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">And slowly, I discovered Jews were living in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> so I began traveling to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and there again I found an interesting thing that in a number of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, the handful of Jews living there were the survivors of the infamous, what I call infamous, death marches.</sentence><sentence id="68">The Germans at the end of the war marched thousands of Jews through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And at the end when they decided to leave, they killed half of the survivors and those that survived dug <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> and got into the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">So as I got into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> I found the Jews living in the old <span class="BUILDING">barns</span>, over <span class="DLF">manure piles</span>, and <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and my job was to get them <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and food and shelter, clothing and...I had Eisenhower's...General Eisenhower's orders in my pocket for the Germans to provide decent housing for them so I was able to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="83">And what happened...what happened then when you started working with these people?</sentence><sentence id="84">What were some of your experiences?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Well, I had many experiences.</sentence><sentence id="89">It should be noted that almost 95 or 99 percent of these Jews were Polish Jews and apparently they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> used to organized life, so one of the first thing they did wherever they settled, they formed their own organizations, so I worked through an organization so I had somebody to talk to, committees who wanted food, clothing, money; who needed help.</sentence><sentence id="90">They had trouble with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, with the United States Army.</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh...I left my wife and two <span class="BUILDING">children home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">I'll never forget one of the first experiences was being from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burglengenfeld</span> where I met a little, small child named Ruthie.</sentence><sentence id="94">Ruth Fleischer, who had been in hiding...hidden with a Polish family.</sentence><sentence id="95">Her father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="96">Her mother lived in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">She went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and found Ruth.</sentence><sentence id="98">And when I met Ruth, I'll never forget the little one said to me, "Mr. Levine," in Yiddish, "I am 10 years old and I don't know how to read and write.</sentence><sentence id="99">Please help me go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="100">First thing the child asked me.</sentence><sentence id="101">But at the beginning, as I said, we had Jews coming and going.</sentence><sentence id="102">There were Jews drifting in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">There was always the question of &gt; The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</sentence><sentence id="104"><span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for these people.</sentence><sentence id="105">At one point, not too long after I came, we had to open a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span>...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> near the city of Cham, C-H-A-M. I want to digress for a moment to say that I was...God was good to me because on the first day of my work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>, in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where Jews hadn't lived for...maybe never lived, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was built in the 1400s.</sentence><sentence id="106">I met a young man named Moshe, M-0-S-H-E, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rechnitz</span>, R-E-C-H-N-I-T- Z. Moshe was about 21 or 22 years old.</sentence><sentence id="107">He spoke a number of languages.</sentence><sentence id="108">He came from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I employed him right there.</sentence><sentence id="109"><span class="BUILDING">Moshe</span> was my driver and my assistant almost like my son.</sentence><sentence id="110">Wonderful young man, so I was...he...he was really my right arm.</sentence><sentence id="111">And while I'm talking about Moshe, I might say that he himself spent...was in 5, 6 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">His mother was killed in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, <span class="BUILDING">munitions plant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> and he was on one of these death marches.</sentence><sentence id="114">And one morning he and I were driving through these beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bavarian hills</span> when we came to beautiful <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">He stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and he asked me to follow him, went down a little... little brook and there I saw shoes, odd shoes laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and he told that he was...when he was on a death march, when they came to this little...this <span class="REGION">area</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamsreid</span>, the Germans killed half of the handful of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="116">And he was one of the living on these people the survivors dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> and Moshe was freed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamsreid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">Now, I traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because these where Jews were organized and these people needed money for food for programs that they ran, and the Joint really financed most of their stuff.</sentence><sentence id="118">I worked mostly with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, which provided food and clothing, and the United States Army, so I ended up being the spokesman for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="119">I had a simulated rank of lieutenant colonel which meant nothing except that it gave me entree to top <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">I dealt with the generals in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, general 4th Armored Division, so that I had no trouble there.</sentence><sentence id="121">Now, many...of course, I have many memories of a lot of things happening.</sentence><sentence id="122">I want: to describe some of them.</sentence><sentence id="123">One morning I was in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> when two men came in.</sentence><sentence id="124">One of them turned to me and said, "Levine, you and the Joint are doing a good job providing food, clothing and shelter, but we need something for the Geist."</sentence><sentence id="125">I think this happened later in the year.</sentence><sentence id="126">At any rate, this incident happened.</sentence><sentence id="127">I said, "What do you mean by Geist?"</sentence><sentence id="128">He said, "Something for the spirit of the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="129">I looked at the man and I said, "What are you talking about?"</sentence><sentence id="130">He said, "We need a <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish newspaper</span>."</sentence><sentence id="131">I might digress for a moment to say that I was fortunate to have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, shortly after...after my arrival and was at that <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> when the first copy of the...called Unser Weg, the Yiddish paper, came off the press, and I brought a copy to give to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">So there's a man who wants a paper published in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">So I asked who he was, and he says, "My name is Silverberg,and I was the editor of the Moment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, which meant nothing to me, but I later learned that the Moment was the New York Times of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">And he said, "What you need is a newspaper."</sentence><sentence id="135">I thought the guy was crazy.</sentence><sentence id="136">I had visions of, you know, what's involved in printing a paper.</sentence><sentence id="137">So I said, "How are you going to print a paper?"</sentence><sentence id="138">So he then told me that before the war, he dealt with a firm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> that supplied types for <span class="REGION">European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">He was confident that even though the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was bombed...it was bombed, he knew where in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> he'd find Yiddish type.</sentence><sentence id="140">Then the said, "If...if you pay for this thing, and pay the expenses...this man introduced me, and now I will go around...we're gonna find hand typesetters."</sentence><sentence id="141">I said, "Fine.</sentence><sentence id="142">What are you going to print it on?" "</sentence><sentence id="143">Oh," he says, "I've already found a local German printer and made arrangements where if we pay him, he'll print it."</sentence><sentence id="144">I said, "That's fine.</sentence><sentence id="145">What about a paper and ink?"</sentence><sentence id="146">He said, "That's where you gotta come in.</sentence><sentence id="147">We already located a German who has a lot of paper and ink hidden.</sentence><sentence id="148">You'll have to get the requisition to...through the United States Army.</sentence><sentence id="149">I believed I involved Rabbi Gene Lipman in this deal.</sentence><sentence id="150">At any rate, the paper finally came out called Der Najer Moment.</sentence><sentence id="151">And a interesting thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="152">Shortly before I left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I got...received a telephone call from an excited Jew, claiming that there were hundreds of Jews at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">And that the commotion, couple of them were shot and there was trouble at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">So I grabbed the man, Abe Cohn, he came to replace me and we jump in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and I had one of the UNRRA men drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and I don't think any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> ever cut across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> faster.</sentence><sentence id="156">Lucky we weren't killed.</sentence><sentence id="157">When I got to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and found six hundred Jews.</sentence><sentence id="158">Apparently, these people were being transported I later learned from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> broke down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">So when J arrived Jews are sleeping on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, some in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, couple tried to make fires to light something.</sentence><sentence id="161">On the far end, there were railroad and German police surrounding young kids, and I understand one young kid was shot in the legs and now...a day later brought him back from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">I learned that these six hundred people --this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> --were given a couple hours notice to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chaplains</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was a shameful thing.</sentence><sentence id="165">They were given a couple slices of meat and bread and no water.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I learned that at night some of the young G.I."s shot their guns in the <span class="DLF">air</span> so the Jews in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> thought they were killing Jews so he told me this story.</sentence><sentence id="167">At any rate, as soon as I learned all this I had all my food I had in my litlle <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> sent over.</sentence><sentence id="168">Emptied my <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">Got a hold of the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, which sent me huge cans of soup and bread and they finally fixed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span>, and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out I wished at that moment that every [American] Jew could have been with me as these Jews, American Jews who made all this possible, as they waved, thanking me.</sentence><sentence id="170">Then I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in order to get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, spent a hour on the telephone just to be connected.</sentence><sentence id="171">I reported this to my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">A day later checked... made arrangements and in the future no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> went out without a chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="173">Now, I didn't get into my pajamas until about 12 o'clock at night when I received a telephone call from Silverberg, the editor of the Moment, asking that I come to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> immediately.</sentence><sentence id="174">I was exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="175">Said something very important happened.</sentence><sentence id="176">I tushed to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and he introduced me to two men who escaped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> who knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silverberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlomober</span>!</sentence><sentence id="178">Berlinsky, who was supposed to have been one of the leading novelists in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and a man named Mendel Mann, who was one of the rising Yiddish poets in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">He introduced me and he wanted me to meet them because these men had no identification.</sentence><sentence id="180">They had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="181">To make sure the next morning I could take care of them so they wouldn't be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="182">While we were talking, Silverberg told me that he would like to print something by these two men to let the world know that they are alive, but he said this presents a problem because I've got the paper set for publication.</sentence><sentence id="183">And it would cost money to reset the paper.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I said, "Go ahead and do it.." Well, to make the story short, the paper came out and shortly thereafter, I was driving to Silverberg's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where outside I saw two young men, one of whom I recognized and he recognized me.</sentence><sentence id="185">Was a member of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutz Nahum</span>, it was a kibbutz about 20 kids, Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir", and I &gt; Hebrew: "the Young Guard"; a collectivist and utopian Zionist youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="186">Mostly active was like their substitute father.</sentence><sentence id="187">And the kids rushed over to me, and the strange kid held the Moment like a hot coal in his hand.</sentence><sentence id="188">And the kid that knew me asked me, "Where did...where does the editor live?"</sentence><sentence id="189"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silverberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">So I said, "What's the excitement about?"</sentence><sentence id="191">He said, "Let him tell you."</sentence><sentence id="192">This kid told me that before the war, he and his mother and sister and, I think, and father, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> [or] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>; either of the two.</sentence><sentence id="193">At any rate, while his father was awlay seeing his publishers, he and his mother and sister were put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">He lost his mother and sister, never saw his father, and he said that after the war he and another buddy decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to look for their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="195">They came to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.891919" long="10.896558">Bamberg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, and from there they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">He told me how he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> looking for his father.</sentence><sentence id="197">He knew his mother died and sister.</sentence><sentence id="198">He came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.891919" long="10.896558">Bamberg</span> and went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that night, got up in the morning and found our paper, the Moment, which was distributed.</sentence><sentence id="199">He took the Moment, and there's an article about his father.</sentence><sentence id="200">He said, "Where is my father?"</sentence><sentence id="201">So that night we reunited father and son, if did nothing else with the paper.</sentence><sentence id="202">Well, at any rate, that's the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="203">A number of other interesting things happened.</sentence><sentence id="204">For instance, in "46 most of...for all these Jews, for almost all of them, it was the first free...I mean it was the first time they could observe Pesach as free man.</sentence><sentence id="205">You know, the war is 39, 46 and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="206">So for days, the Joint sent me in a shipment of matzoh and wine and I spent my travel money to make arrangements with communities to come in and pick up their requisitions.</sentence><sentence id="207">And for a week or two Moshe and I spent time doling out matzoh and wines and Haggadot and they gave them money to buy fish.</sentence><sentence id="208">And several things happened.</sentence><sentence id="209">When I...after I got through meeting with the last delegation, I went up to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and I reported that everything was distributed.</sentence><sentence id="210">They then asked whether I gave...distributed wine or matzoh to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Deggendorf</span>...1200 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="211">So I told them they hadn't sent it...they didn't send me anything.</sentence><sentence id="212">I felt so wonderful and suddenly the bottom fell out.</sentence><sentence id="213">No wine for 1200 people.</sentence><sentence id="214">So I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> and they were smart.</sentence><sentence id="215">They made their own wine, and they baked their own matzoh.</sentence><sentence id="216">Well the reason I tell this story is that at that time the chief medical officer for the <span class="REGION">area</span> which had 300,000 DPs...there were only a very small number of Jews, like I don't know many thousands...4 thousand, 5 thousand, where the Jewish doctor, woman doctor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> a Dr. Anna Monatov (ph).</sentence><sentence id="217">I remembered her.</sentence><sentence id="218">I also had working with me a nurse sent by the Jewish Agency, Becky Lyons, who is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="219">She is now...she has a doctorate, which she is now a world authority in hospital administration.</sentence><sentence id="220">Lectures all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="221">And then there was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> major from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span>, a kid named Badian.</sentence><sentence id="222">And I invited these three to be my guest, you know, for seder to join the people I was with.</sentence><sentence id="223">After the service in the <span class="BUILDING">makeshift synagogue</span>, oh, yes, and the president of the Gemeinde, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> was the man named Jacob Gottlieb, who unfortunately was my age but his hair was white because I was told he watched his wife and two children thrown in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">At any rate, so we went to the first seder...to seder with the kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and it was heartbreaking for me because there were 20 kids, no mother, no father, no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="225">We had a comparatively short service.</sentence><sentence id="226">No meat of course, just simple seder, but what we lacked in food the kids made up in spirit as they did all...every time I was with them, their singing and their dancing, and they singing like they're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">Wonderful singing.</sentence><sentence id="228">When I...we left the kids about 10 o'clock at night, my guests and I walked toward the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span> is a <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is a thousand years old or more.</sentence><sentence id="231">So as we approached...it was a moonlight night, and as we approached the...the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center building</span> which, incidently, was in the shadow of a hugh <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> built 4 or 5 hundred years ago, we heard noises coming from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">And came to the <span class="BUILDING">Center</span> and we found that they had a community seder on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">They cleaned out all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, put up these wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and as we walked in, they had just finished their meal and I saw a sea of men and women and this little child and they weren't happy.</sentence><sentence id="234">But as soon as they saw us, they began to sing and then sang another song.</sentence><sentence id="235">Suddenly, they were not alone.</sentence><sentence id="236">Within a few minutes four guys ran downstairs and they brought up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">This was a seder.</sentence><sentence id="238">The guy began...one of of the men sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, began to play.</sentence><sentence id="239">The other was singing.</sentence><sentence id="240">Then two or three couples got on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and began to dance.</sentence><sentence id="241">While this was going on, I saw one man throw...they had huge <span class="DLF">windows</span>, <span class="DLF">German windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">He threw them out as if to let the world know that the Jews are still alive and they sang as loud as they could as if to let the Germans and the world know that they were alive.</sentence><sentence id="243">At any rate, this seder went on til about another hour or so, then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and wrote a letter to my wife describing that.</sentence><sentence id="244">That was the first seder.</sentence><sentence id="245">I think it's important to describe the first Hanukkah.</sentence><sentence id="246">The first Hanukkah, this is in 45.</sentence><sentence id="247">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">The Jews had no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> there so I got a...requisitioned an old <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> which...when the Germans stopped using a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, you can imagine what condition it was in.</sentence><sentence id="249">But the Jews cleaned it up, repainted the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, and had the section put up...the section for a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and the rest was for a <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I got military permission --there was a curfew-- for the Jews to stay out late that night, and we had our first Hanukkah light lit in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">makeshift synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">It happened that at that time...first I got to say that before this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>...before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>, our service, I might tell you that I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> with a bunch of mail and letters and so forth, and while I was...came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of the President Schwarzfuchs, I noticed a gentleman sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="252">He was a bearded man sitting like this.</sentence><sentence id="253">He suddenly turned to me and say, "Was fiir ein Joint ist da?"</sentence><sentence id="254">The Joint is our organization.</sentence><sentence id="255">So I turned to Schwarzfuchs, I said, "Who is this man?"</sentence><sentence id="256">He says, "He is a Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="257">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>."</sentence><sentence id="258">Survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">So I said, "Was meint ihr?</sentence><sentence id="260">What do you mean?"</sentence><sentence id="261">He says, "Wo ist die Mikvah fiir die <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Weiber</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="262">You know the mikvah.</sentence><sentence id="263">I'm in this stinking little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">"Und wo sind die Hanukkah-Lichter ftir Hanukkah?".</sentence><sentence id="265">I didn't realize Hanukkah was in another week.</sentence><sentence id="266">So I went down...so within a few days I went to a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, <span class="BUILDING">military warehouse</span>, in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walhalla</span>, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>, not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">And when the supply man wouldn't give me any candles...I figured I'd get

long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">Took me an hour to get through.</sentence><sentence id="270">And the man in charge gave me...gave this guy permission to give me some cases of candles.</sentence><sentence id="271">So my driver and I then went back and we were cutting candles in half when I got phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and advising me that the Rabbi, Chaplain Gene Lipman, had been to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, brought back Palestinian candles, and holders, the Menorahs, and was on the way and within a short time Gene came with his assistant, Si Pava, and the four of us were sorting bundles of candles and we distributed them to the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">Now let me go back to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> So the first Hanukkah light I thought I'd spend it with the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">It was my own...almost just like my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And this Rabbi was still there, so he gave a address.</sentence><sentence id="275">He spoke about a half an hour, and then there was joy and we had kegs of beer and we celebrated.</sentence><sentence id="276">I spent...went a few other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> for different <span class="BUILDING">Hannukahs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">But the Jast Hanukkah candle lighting and I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> was not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">And the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> was man named by Steven Schwartz, who was an engineer.</sentence><sentence id="280">Wonderful gentleman.</sentence><sentence id="281">And I took with me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>, I think I brought the Rabbi, Joseph Glazer, who...later we gave him the title of Oberrabbi, Chief Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="282">He's alive and lives in <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">I walked in to a magnificent, newly painted <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">I learned that during...the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was built in 1907.</sentence><sentence id="286">During the war the Germans turned it into a <span

class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> they would find the original plans for it, and sure enough in a case they found the original, you know, architectural and drawing plans.</sentence><sentence id="290">And there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> major and they forced the Germans to redo the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as it was.</sentence><sentence id="291">So Steven Schwartz used that...used this oocasion of the last candle almost like a rededication of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I'll never forget Steven had a huge Menorah built in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he had huge candles in it.</sentence><sentence id="292">Must have been stolen from some <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">On the Bimah, he had covered with velvet, he had this beautiful, little, hand carved Menorah I bought...you know, the Gene Lipman from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and Palestinian candles were lit.</sentence><sentence id="294">Can you picture the scene?</sentence><sentence id="295">In the audience were the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>, a few Jewish Gls, and Schwartz arranged a program which included music by the first musical group in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Deggendorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">And as I listened to them, there were tears down my eyes to think that thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews with that kind of talent were burned in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">I was the last speaker, and I'll never forget looking into these sad faces.</sentence><sentence id="298">And when I got through, it was like a wind came in and slowly they drifted out.</sentence><sentence id="299">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I sat down and wrote my wife a letter and I, of course, realized what do they have to be happy about?Hanukkah, the joyous moment.</sentence><sentence id="300">So that was the Hanukkah.</sentence><sentence id="301">I went one later on, but I missed my first great experience and I better tel] it now, and that is my visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">On October 6, 1945, the day before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>, I heard there is a camp at <span

class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">And the driver, this man was in back of me...I believe there was a German guide.</sentence><sentence id="312">I can't say for sure.</sentence><sentence id="313">At any rate, we walked into what I learned was the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> were covered with blood.</sentence><sentence id="315">Now, it's beautiful, painted white if you go there.</sentence><sentence id="316">It's a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">From the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, I walked into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">I recall turning back and looking at this man's face.</sentence><sentence id="319">It was green.</sentence><sentence id="320">And mine...mine must have been the same way.</sentence><sentence id="321">I walked into a third <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was lined with shelves with small earten jars.</sentence><sentence id="322">And I looked down and in front of me were two barrels of human ashes.</sentence><sentence id="323">My blood must have been frozen.</sentence><sentence id="324">I turned to my right and I wanted to grab the first thing I could and there was a barrel with these earthen jar covers, which I brought.</sentence><sentence id="325">And by that point I wanted to get out into the sunlight.</sentence><sentence id="326">And I didn't want to see anything of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">And we walked to the far end of the <span class="DLF">lot</span> and we got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">And the man turned to me and said, "Levine, look what you got in your hands?"</sentence><sentence id="329">The jar covers were just almost like glued.</sentence><sentence id="330">So we finally calmed down, both of us and I might say that as we were leaving, we saw Germans playing FuBball, soccer.</sentence><sentence id="331">They were guards who were prisoners of the United States army.</sentence><sentence id="332">They were being fed 4,000 calories a day as prisoners, while the Jews were getting 1700 calories a day from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and the military, most of it potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="333">At any rate, as we left, we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">We both calmed down.</sentence><sentence id="335">And after 5 minutes or so the man turned...said to me, "Levine, did you notice that I was reluctant to drive you?"</sentence><sentence id="336">I said, "Yes." "</sentence><sentence id="337">So, I'll tell you why."</sentence><sentence id="338">He says, "I was on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>...last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">The Americans were

long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">Almost half of the people dropped dead or were shot on the way.</sentence><sentence id="344">And before the Germans ran away...this was the pattern...they'd shot half of the survivors."</sentence><sentence id="345">And he said, "I was among the living and I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">That's why you found me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>."</sentence><sentence id="347">Then he said, "Who would have thought that I who was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> to be exterminated would walk through and come out alive."</sentence><sentence id="348">So that's; just one of the incidents.</sentence><sentence id="349">I want to say something about my dear friend, Chaim Diamond.</sentence><sentence id="350">Chaim Diamond was a young man who, with his younger brother, were survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">Chaim was the president of the little community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">He later became active and was a member of the Central Committee.</sentence><sentence id="353">And I left him in "46.</sentence><sentence id="354">We renewed friendship in "56 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where he is a successful businessman and we've been friends ever since.</sentence><sentence id="355">And while talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaim</span>, I can also talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> because this is an example of what kind of work I did.</sentence><sentence id="356">For instanae, one day I received a telephone call from the UNRRA Director, who was a gentlemen from <span class="REGION">Virgin Islands</span> named Johnson.</sentence><sentence id="357">He called me up.</sentence><sentence id="358">I'd never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> but he called me up and told me the story that there were Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> under horrible living conditions and that there was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>...I thought he said it was owned by a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="359">At any rate, which is about to be turned over to the Germans by the town major, and he suggested that I try to come down and maybe try to get the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="360">So I drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> and I had my notes <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I took inventory of how Jews lived.</sentence><sentence id="361">Six people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, five people in one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">twin bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">It was horrible conditions.</sentence><sentence id="363">So I talked to the Jews, came back, saw the colonel in charge of this department for the army, gave him the report at 9 o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="364">By 4 o'clock in the afternoon he sent over a message to me, "You can have the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>."</sentence><sentence id="365">So they arranged for the Jews to move into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">That wasn't all.</sentence><sentence id="367">After the Jews settled, the delegation came to me, "We need a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span>."</sentence><sentence id="368">So we found an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">building</span> not...almost a block away from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and I got that from the military.</sentence><sentence id="369">And the Jews again cleaned it up, painted it, so forth.</sentence><sentence id="370">I took some people with me for the...on the official opening, and what a Joy it was to walk into this newly-painted <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">The fixtures were made by a man who was in the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, and they made the fixtures from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>...parts of parts of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, and there were Jewish musicians singing and dancing until about 4 o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="372">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> where Chaim Diamond was one of the leaders.</sentence><sentence id="373"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> has to be mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="374"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> was a camp of 400 Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, mostly German Jews who were rescued from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> and Chaplain Lipman had a lot to do with them coming there.</sentence><sentence id="375">And I must say that I met Gene Lipman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and he said, "We'll get together."</sentence><sentence id="376">Two days after I was in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span>, Gene Lipman appeared with his assistant, Si, Simon Pava, P-A-V-A, wonderful Chaplain's assistant.</sentence><sentence id="377">And he said, "Joe, what did you bring with you from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="378">Can you take it with you?</sentence><sentence id="379">We're going to a birthday party."</sentence><sentence id="380">And, of course, I was there only one day, so I had stuff that I brought from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">Canned stuff to give away.</sentence><sentence id="382">Put it in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the Jeep</span> and we <span class="DLF">road</span> to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terschenreuth</span> (ph) where there were four sisters whom Gene helped to live.</sentence><sentence id="383">He realled saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="384">We had a wonderful party.</sentence><sentence id="385">That night I slept with Gene in a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">At 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by Gene.</sentence><sentence id="387">He said, "Joe, we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span>," which meant nothing to me.</sentence><sentence id="388">And it was my first four hour ride in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">Almost killed my insides.</sentence><sentence id="390">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> and when people saw Gene and his assistant, it was almost that noise like a messiah came.</sentence><sentence id="391">Hundreds of people suddenly began approaching.</sentence><sentence id="392">See, Gene was one of the saviors.</sentence><sentence id="393">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was well- organized.</sentence><sentence id="394">A woman named Kitty Rothschild ran it til the end.</sentence><sentence id="395">At any rate, what happened...I'm telling you the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> because when Gene appeared he carried bags of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="751">The Jews returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and there was antisemitism and they killed a number of Jews, so Jews fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="752">And this was already in "46 and I got to tell you a story how I was

The Kielce Pogrom took place on 4 July 1946.</sentence><sentence id="755">Forty-two Jews were killed, and the incident initiated a mass migration of surviving Eastern European Jews to the

id="770">He said, "While you were gone, the General and I discussed the problem of housing for the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="771">You see the Army was responsible for a lot of this.</sentence><sentence id="772">And they wanted efficiency and they then told me...so he then said, "We decided we found a way to solve the problem."</sentence><sentence id="773">I said, "What do you have in mind?"</sentence><sentence id="774">he said, "Well in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span> (P-O-C-K-I-N-G) down near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span>, southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, we have a camp where there are four thousand Hungarians and two

it?"</sentence><sentence id="781">I talked to these Generals and I said, "Are you guys crazy or nuts?"</sentence><sentence id="782">I said, "Number one, you'll have to take every Jew and carry him

long="13.277661">Pocking</span>, and we found these Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="792">It was maddening for me to see these beautiful, well-dressed women with beautiful expensive fur coats.</sentence><sentence id="793">The Hungarians worked for the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="794">And there were Poles there, but we found that this was a huge <span class="DLF">air base</span>, used by Hermann Goring, with hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that had been bombed Installation of 1O or 15 thousand people were with <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, <span

id="803">And then we began shipping Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="804">Shortly after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> opened, the General again sent a message to me: wants to see me.</sentence><sentence id="805">He said, "Joe, we'll having trouble with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">The Jews are burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, which is presenting a problem to the military.</sentence><sentence id="807">Go down and see what's what."</sentence><sentence id="808">So I went down and I...sure enough when the Poles left they took all the wood and the saws and everything else that the Jews were supposed to get, the Gls sold them on the route, and the Jews were freezing so they burned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="809">And they complained; well, we took care of that.</sentence><sentence id="810">I might say that two

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: Now during this trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span>, I recall several things happened.</sentence><sentence id="823">Number one, if I haven't mentioned it, I want to say that I took along with me...I brought to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> Becky Lyons, the nurse who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> sent by the Jewish Agency.</sentence><sentence id="824">I called a meeting of all the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to explain to them that I was working with the military and will see that they will get whatever they need to make life more comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="825">As we were waiting for this group to get together, I found myself sitting next to a man and little son, about 10 or 11 years old, and I got in a conversation with the man and he told me that he was a partisan.</sentence><sentence id="826">You know, through most of the war he lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with his son.</sentence><sentence id="827">His wife was killed.</sentence><sentence id="828">And I turned to the little boy and I said, "What did you do?"</sentence><sentence id="829">He said, "I was a partisanchik."</sentence><sentence id="830">I was a little partisan.</sentence><sentence id="831">And then he said, "The other two kids who were there with me used to join me and at night we'd sneak into the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to steal food."</sentence><sentence id="832">And then in Yiddish he said, "If we had to shoot, we shot."</sentence><sentence id="833">This was a little kid.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: How old about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: About Il, 12 years old.</sentence><sentence id="849">And then his father said to him in Yiddish, "Show them where they shot you."</sentence><sentence id="850">And the kid picked up his sleeve, and he slowed me where he had been shot through the arm.</sentence><sentence id="851">This is a little kid.</sentence><sentence id="852">At any rate, I still remember standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> with Becky Lyons with me, and when I introduced Becky as coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, the symbol, a living person from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where they wanted to go, I saw a sea of smiles as she said "Shalom."</sentence><sentence id="853">Just that one word, shalom, lit up the faces of the whole crowd.</sentence><sentence id="854">Another thing that happened that day, I remember, was I found that: there was a transport of about 20 children, the first transport.</sentence><sentence id="855">Later on there were hundreds of children brought in.</sentence><sentence id="856">I'll tell you where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="857">And I walked into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where these kids were sleeping on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">I spoke to the leader called Amadrich, a young girl about 18 years old and I'll never forget when I asked her what I could provide that the kids needed most, and her reply was, "Get me paper.</sentence><sentence id="859">Get me pencils.</sentence><sentence id="860">Maybe books.</sentence><sentence id="861">These children have to learn."</sentence><sentence id="862">This was the first thing she asked me for.</sentence><sentence id="863">Well, to end the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span>, I might say that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span> grew to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with about 6 or 8 thousand Jews.</sentence><sentence id="864">You see, Jews were fleeing from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and other parts of Europe into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United States Zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="865">Since they had not been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, you know, this was better than sleeping <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">Children appeared because the Jewish Brigade boys brought them.</sentence><sentence id="867">You know, people don't know the story that after the war, members of the Jewish Brigade in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> volunteered to go into Europe to find children, and they went into <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they found Jewish children that were living in <span class="BUILDING">monasteries</span> or whatever, and they brought them into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United States Zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">And that explains why there were so many children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span>.</sentence><sentence id="869"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> threw a large team into 3 Pocking, a Jewish member of the Joint named, I think the first name was Ruth, Fisher.</sentence><sentence id="870">F-I-S- H-E-R, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> was the Joint worker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span>.</sentence><sentence id="871">At any rate, that's the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span>, and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I have the figures of population....I'll turn it over to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span>...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.370794" long="13.277661">Pocking</span> by the end of the time I left.</sentence><sentence id="872">And one unforgettable thing that happened...I don't know whether I gave it to her for...to show here, but I brought it with me is the story of the Barhovich siddur.</sentence><sentence id="873">Now Moshe Barhovich was the head of the Vad Hadati, extreme organized Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">I worked with Moshe.</sentence><sentence id="875">To give you an example of the kind of work he did, when a Polish young man whom I helped to become a director opened up a small camp in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where they took over the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where Hitler trained some of his toughest men for murder, a small camp was opened.</sentence><sentence id="876">And I went on the day when the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> arrived, and Tony did a beautiful job of fixing the <span class="NPIP">place</span> liveable, and within 10 minutes a delegation came to me, saying, "The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is fine, but where is the <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="877">So Tony, as a Polish Catholic, didn't think of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">The army didn't think of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and I didn't mention it.</sentence><sentence id="879">So I had quite a job to convince the Jews that I'm going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span>, and I'll see that everything was sent up within a day or two for a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">When I came back to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, Moshe...I mean this man Bohovich, was waiting for me, and he wanted to know what about the <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="881">So I told him the problem I had.</sentence><sentence id="882">I found there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, but we gotta go out and buy the pots and pans, and we'll do it.</sentence><sentence id="883">He said, "You give me the money and I'll go out and get it."</sentence><sentence id="884">Three hours later.</sentence><sentence id="885">I looked out of my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I saw a sight I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="886">This fellow, Bohovich, and two men with him apparently rented a hugh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span>, one of the big ones.</sentence><sentence id="887">I looked out of my <span class="DLF">window</span> and there is Bohovich sitting in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, surrounded with pots and pans, came to tell he that he was on the way to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="888">That night they had their <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">They made a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">Well, at any rate, I think it was Purim, where I went to the services in the makeship <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="891">Moshe showed up with his two young boys.</sentence><sentence id="892">He had maybe 13 or 14 year-old boys.</sentence><sentence id="893">We had few siddurim, prayer books, and as the service started, Moshe pulled out a siddur, a book.</sentence><sentence id="894">And I was sitting next to them, and the three of them, all of them doven, prayed, from this one book.</sentence><sentence id="895">After the service I examined the book and I found that it had...I later counted them...148 pages of a hand- printed siddur.</sentence><sentence id="896">So as to the story of the siddur, which I asked him later to write out, which I have here in Yiddish and I ought to translate into English.</sentence><sentence id="897">And the story was that he and his family lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="898">The Germans entered....captured the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and the Poles worked with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="899">He recalls how the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed, Torahs they ripped up, and how....he describes in this letter how his daughter and wife and sister and children were killed, mentioned to me that he thought he was among only a handful of survivors of 15,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="900">He had been a partisan, but when the wrote the siddur, he said he was living in hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of a Pole, who also took advantage of him he said.</sentence><sentence id="901">At any rate, being a former..a pious Jew who worshiped three times a day, fearing that he may die and his boys would not have prayer book to doven, he said I didn't even have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stand up because I got...somehow he got paper and ink well and ink and from memory he wrote this siddur, Bohovich siddur.</sentence><sentence id="902">So I cabled <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I got the proper paper and I got a hold of a German who made several copies.</sentence><sentence id="903">I have one copy.</sentence><sentence id="904">I gave Rabbi Lipman the small copy which the German first experimented and I had another copy which I gave to the archives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, so that it is now in the Yad

collection of rare books.</sentence><sentence id="907">Now this was all in.... Now, after the war when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I made efforts and I contacted a number of these people: Americans, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="908">I kept on a correspondence and I began looking for Moshe Bohovich.</sentence><sentence id="909">And one day I wrote to Yivo, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and asked them if they heard about it, and they told me that in the memorial book on Zelechow, you know, after the war there were hundreds of memorial books published by groups to memorialize their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>...the pictures of the dead.</sentence><sentence id="910">And they told me if I went to the memorial book on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span>, there is something by Moshe Bohovich.</sentence><sentence id="911">And then they said...they suggested I write to a guy named Kaplan Cohn in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">So I wrote to Cohn, and within a week I got a letter from a guy.</sentence><sentence id="913">He said, "I'm Moshe Bohovich.</sentence><sentence id="914">I understand you're looking for me.</sentence><sentence id="915">I live at <span class="DLF">233 Grand Street</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="916">Within a short time, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I met Moshe.</sentence><sentence id="917">Now because he had two chiLdren, he was among the earliest ones I helped to get the heck out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="918">Of course, I...when he left I assumed he was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="919">When I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, he told me that he and his children ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Jose</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="920">He started an <span class="BUILDING">export business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="921">By that time, his two sons were grown.</sentence><sentence id="922">He had a son with 4, 5 children who was running the business.</sentence><sentence id="923">He spent 4 months in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>, 4 months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span>, and 4 months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="924">Goodness.</sentence><sentence id="925">His other son, Bernado, graduated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, got a degree from <span class="BUILDING">University of Barcelona</span>, was one of the leading attorneys in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>; still practices under the name of Baruch Bohovich Abstein.</sentence><sentence id="926">In <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>, was represented <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
