<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1290">A: Well, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1291">I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in <span class="NPIP">places</span> where, especially where they had the trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, it's somebody's fantasies.</sentence><sentence id="1292">And I'm here to tell you that it did happen.</sentence><sentence id="1293">And I guess that's probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history.</sentence><sentence id="1294">And if you don't learn nothing, you don't learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1295">That was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russians weren't that much better than the Nazis were.</sentence><sentence id="1296">They had the <span class="INT_SPACE">gulags</span>, they had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1297">May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings.</sentence><sentence id="1298">That's basically what decided, probably the only force in the world 17</sentence><sentence id="1300">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 18 during this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces.</sentence><sentence id="1301">And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service.</sentence><sentence id="1302">I served in the Israeli Army.</sentence><sentence id="1303">I fought in the <span class="REGION">Sinai Desert</span> in "56.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And so I've been through the wringer.</sentence><sentence id="1305">But that wouldn't affect <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, doesn't affect the world.</sentence><sentence id="1306">And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the U.S. Armed Forces.</sentence><sentence id="1307">So, that was my main motivation of joining the Service.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1328">Q: Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, did you, I'm trying to think of how to form the question.</sentence><sentence id="1329">But I'm wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution.</sentence><sentence id="1330">Did you have any understanding of what...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1334">A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that's the only thing that... you know.</sentence><sentence id="1335">And then as I got older and I read.</sentence><sentence id="1336">I'm not educated very well.</sentence><sentence id="1337">I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> GED and I got some <span class="BUILDING">college</span> behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours.</sentence><sentence id="1338">But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically... I don't blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do.</sentence><sentence id="1339">They always kept them outside of the mainstream society.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things.</sentence><sentence id="1341">So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them.</sentence><sentence id="1342">And then the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> teaching basically demonized them.</sentence><sentence id="1343">So, I don't think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn't, didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Because it's supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they're teaching.</sentence><sentence id="1345">But I guess that wasn't what, what actually happened.</sentence><sentence id="1346">I've seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1347">Kill him.</sentence><sentence id="1348">And what human being would do something like that?</sentence><sentence id="1349">And then they go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to pray?</sentence><sentence id="1350">I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion.</sentence><sentence id="1351">Take a look right now.</sentence><sentence id="1352">Sudan, got a Muslim against the Christians.</sentence><sentence id="1353"><span class="REGION">Northern Ireland</span>, Catholics against the Protestants.</sentence><sentence id="1354">You go to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span>, you got the... <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span>, you got one sect fighting another and again it's religion.</sentence><sentence id="1355"><span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>, Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims.</sentence><sentence id="1356">So every <span class="NPIP">place</span> you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion.</sentence><sentence id="1357">That's my view.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1386">A: Well, that's something different, because if there was an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the Second World War, before... this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1387">Because I'm not looking at it as religion, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1388">I look at it as a homeland for a people.</sentence><sentence id="1389">Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people.</sentence><sentence id="1390">And I'm Jewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every people need a homeland.</sentence><sentence id="1391">And that's what motivated me.</sentence><sentence id="1392">But I always consider myself American, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was American, so I considered myself American.</sentence><sentence id="1393">And he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in 1906.18</sentence><sentence id="1395">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0014 19 And he always told me that he is American and one of these days we're going to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1396">So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> himself and everything, that in "59 I came and joined him in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="REGION">south part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3452">Plus we had Air Force up there, who were relaying instructions to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-52 Bombers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3453">So we're sitting on a seven thousand foot <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> all the way around us.</sentence><sentence id="3454">Charlie was down there.</sentence><sentence id="3455">We lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3456">We got attacked by <span class="BUILDING">mortars</span>, you know, and that kind of that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3457">We didn't have no direct confrontation.</sentence><sentence id="3458">Then from there I moved to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Phu Ti Valley</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3459">which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nha Trang</span> and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division.</sentence><sentence id="3460">That is an Infantry Division, who were actually doing the combat.</sentence><sentence id="3461">We were supporting them and going out to, when they went out for a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communication.</sentence><sentence id="3462">So, we got shot at, but we weren't involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job.</sentence><sentence id="3463">The Koreans did that.</sentence><sentence id="3464">So, but I was running <span class="DLF">Highway One</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ban Me Thuot</span>, and every morning before you even got on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the <span class="DLF">mines</span> out of there.</sentence><sentence id="3465">So you never knew from one minute to the next when you're going to get on a <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3466">And then the Vietnamese had this nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>-type <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi cabs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3467">And you would come around with your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down, like ina curve.</sentence><sentence id="3468">And you had to stop down to not run over them.</sentence><sentence id="3469">And when you slowed down, they would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side.</sentence><sentence id="3470">So what you define "combat"?</sentence><sentence id="3471">In <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> there wasn't any really... no, I wasn't in the infantry unit.</sentence><sentence id="3472">But in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base camp</span>, we got attacked.</sentence><sentence id="3473">We killed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph)charged us.</sentence><sentence id="3474">One of them was our base barber that we killed.</sentence><sentence id="3475">He was a Viet Cong.</sentence><sentence id="3476">So you never knew who your, I mean who was your friend, who was your enemy.</sentence><sentence id="3477">It was a weird kind of a war.</sentence><sentence id="3478">There was no <span class="DLF">front line</span>, like in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> or Second World War.</sentence><sentence id="3479">You didn't know who was your friend or who was your foe, besides your own buddies in your own unit.</sentence><sentence id="3480">Because all Vietnamese could have been Viet Cong.</sentence><sentence id="3481">We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3482">What they would do if you didn't have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a rubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3483">Then the gas would eat away the rubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereens.</sentence><sentence id="3484">So, you had to actually lock down with a lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn't stick nothing in there.</sentence><sentence id="3485">Children were, they would hawk on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3486">They would try to sell you coke.</sentence><sentence id="3487">Well if you're stupid enough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it.</sentence><sentence id="3488">If you drank that stuff it tore your guts up <span class="NPIP">inside</span> with shreds, slivers of glass. [</sentence><sentence id="3489">Laughing.]</sentence><sentence id="3490">So it was a different kind of war.</sentence><sentence id="3491">It wasn't the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="3492">But no, I wasn't... you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans.</sentence><sentence id="3493">I took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> from the seven thousand-foot <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> down to the <span class="DLF">air field</span> about twenty miles away to pick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3494">We got ambushed periodically on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="3495">Well, you call that combat?</sentence><sentence id="3496">I would call that combat, but I wasn't one of those guys that were crawling down those <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, tunnel rats or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="3497">I wasn't in the Infantry outfit fighting.</sentence><sentence id="3498">I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was Special Forces.</sentence><sentence id="3499">He was on long range patrol.</sentence><sentence id="3500">They went out to search Charlie.</sentence><sentence id="3501">Now I would say he was in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> more than I was.</sentence><sentence id="3502">I just reacted when Charlie attacked me.</sentence><sentence id="3503">He went <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0014 40 out looking for him, that's different.</sentence><sentence id="3504">But I did whatever was assigned me.</sentence><sentence id="3505">I came to "Nam.</sentence><sentence id="3506">I was supposed to go to a direct support unit.</sentence><sentence id="3507">Not even get close to where the combat was.</sentence><sentence id="3508">I was supposed to work on repairing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3509">I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cam Ranh Bay</span> and they said, "Eh, you are now, guess what.</sentence><sentence id="3510">You are now a 6-3 Charlie.</sentence><sentence id="3511">You are a motor sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="3512">You are going up in the <span class="REGION">Central Highlands</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3513">Instead of staying right there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nha Trang</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3514">Believe me, two years in "Nam and I never seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3515">I don't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> looks like.</sentence><sentence id="3516">I never been there.</sentence><sentence id="3517">All my time was up in the <span class="REGION">Central Highlands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3518">I took two R&amp;R tours, one I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and one I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3519">Get away from it to relax.</sentence></p></dialogue>
