<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: What did you see in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, you didn't see too much on the surface except that the things were highly regimented.</sentence><sentence id="61">By the time I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the consolidation of power by the Nazis had well taken place.</sentence><sentence id="62">However, I did get there in time to have a big tour of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span>, because one of the German students, his father was the Director of the Gutehoffnungshuete asked me to visit with their family and so on.</sentence><sentence id="63">And then I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> for the Goering- Sonnemann wedding.</sentence><sentence id="64">He married...Goering married a movie actress by the name of Sonnemann, Emmy Sonnemann and I went and stood on the curb side behind four rows of storm troopers and saw Hitler lead the parade and Goering down to the Dom, where he was married and back from the Dom and I took a picture upside down which I still have, which shows Hitler in the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> behind Goering and Sonnemann.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: How did...from the Labor Board, how did you come involved in...as the war drew...drew closer in the war itself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Well, actually the work at the <span class="BUILDING">Labor Board</span> I was in the Trial Section which I wanted to be in, and I was sent around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on first easier cases and then more difficult ones.</sentence><sentence id="89">And I got a lot of trial experience.</sentence><sentence id="90">And then I wound up finally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at the time the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="91">I enlisted and since I had been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, they shipped me right to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a Sergeant without any basic training or anything like that and assigned me to the Inspector General.</sentence><sentence id="92">Traveled all over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="REGION">Northern Ireland</span> for up until after the invasion, the Allies invaded <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And then like a good Inspector General, I came down a month "German: <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">Referring in this instance specifically to the <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">later and spent the next nearly the next year in <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span> inspecting installations.</sentence><sentence id="96">And from there, I worked into OSS, which is another story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Tell us a little bit because it is relevant...a little bit about what you did in OSS.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Well, my...an old friend from the Labor Board was Gerhard Van Arkel, and he was one of the assistants of Arthur Goldberg, who was then a Major and the head of the German Labor Desk of OSS.</sentence><sentence id="110">And Van Arkel came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oran</span> which is my base in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>, and tried to persuade me for some time to come with OSS as a training officer.</sentence><sentence id="111">Well, we finally worked it so that I could get there because I...my boss didn't want to let me go.</sentence><sentence id="112">And when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> and I worked with about 12 or 13 Germans who had fought in with the Loyalists in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> against the Dictator Franco, or the upcoming Dictator Franco, and of course, that helped solidify too my feelings and about things in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and gave me more information about how OSS operated.</sentence><sentence id="113">I met Wild Bill, General Wild Bill Donovan" at that time, but never knew him well.</sentence><sentence id="114">And at a certain point Arthur Goldberg asked me to come back and be the Director of Training for the German-Labor Desk in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">I did that and when the...looked like the war was winding down a good deal, I moved over to the Labor Branch of the Department of the Army because there were tremendous manpower shortages in various industries: aluminum, forge and foundry work, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="116">And while I was working on that along came VE Day and Justice Jackson, meanwhile, had been appointed Chief of Counsel for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>* and I came back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and he made his first report to President Truman.</sentence><sentence id="117">I was terribly impressed by what he'd...what he reported on and I made up my mind that somehow I was going to get on Justice Jackson's staff.</sentence><sentence id="118">I didn't know Justice Jackson, but I did know David K. Niles, who was an assistant to the President, and he sent a ...a letter recommending me to Justice Jackson, but nothing ever.</sentence><sentence id="119">Meanwhile, I thought that might be the case, so I went back to OSS, to the General Counsel's office", and told him that I would like to work on the trials, and he told me that OSS was actually furnishing most of the data for Justice Jackson because the Department of Justice had very little and our War Department had very little.</sentence><sentence id="120">And he said, "But in our files, the research and analysis here, we have something about practically everything that's happened in Nazi Germany."</sentence><sentence id="121">I said, "Fine."</sentence><sentence id="122">And so for the next month or so, I just studied those files like a trooper.</sentence><sentence id="123">A professor by the name of Franz Neumann wrote a book called Behemoth", was there and he gave me some tips on different things to do and when he found out I was interested in the Trade Union Movement, he gave me a book in which the Nazis bragged *The Head of OSS.</sentence><sentence id="124">Information supplied by interviewee. *</sentence><sentence id="125">Justice Robert Jackson was appointed represent the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the <span class="BUILDING">War Crimes Tribunal</span>.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Why don't you pick it up from there and tell us about indeed going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and beginning the first research in the first work before the trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in July of 1939 -- I'm sorry, 1945, and met some of the staff.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I could tell that a lot of them had gotten so accustomed to being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> that they weren't anxious to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">But Colonel Storey(r), the head of the Documentation Division, had already established <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">And I tried...I persuaded them to let me get there as soon as possible.</sentence><sentence id="170">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in July of 1945, the Rosenberg files had just been brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rue de Pressbourg</span> which was the headquarters of the <span class="BUILDING">OSS office</span> there and now became the head of the Chief of Counsel War Crimes office."</sentence><sentence id="171">So here I saw all these volumes.</sentence><sentence id="172">Some of them had still had hay sticking out of them or straw.</sentence><sentence id="173">Uh...Rosenberg had buried these files behind a <span class="DLF">double wall</span>, but some German had seen him do it and reported it to an Allied officer, an American officer and the American officer told us, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="174">So they were brought in there.</sentence><sentence id="175">There were few people to work on those files.</sentence><sentence id="176">And Colonel Storey didn't speak any German and he had gotten from the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> and so on, a few people who are...spoke German, and they'd begun.</sentence><sentence id="177">But he said out of the Rosenberg, what they producing out of the Rosenberg files is a tremendous number...amount of materials on slave labor and spoilation and the stealing of art treasures and all this kind of thing, but they haven't produced anything that directly ties them to aggressive war.</sentence><sentence id="178">I wish you'd tackle that.</sentence><sentence id="179">So that was my first day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And that night after dinner, I came back and gazed at this files.</sentence><sentence id="181">And they were all thick Leitz Omers(r) about 3 inches thick, except one which was about an inch thick or so.</sentence><sentence id="182">And that had on the back of it Norwegen APA--<span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Foreign Political Office</span>, Auslandspolitischesamt, and I just figured that was easier to tackle than any big volume.</sentence><sentence id="183">So I pulled it down.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I started to think.</sentence><sentence id="185">Now, let's see, there was a Quisling.</sentence><sentence id="186">And Vidkun Quisling, and he became a collaborator.</sentence><sentence id="187">Let's see when was <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> invaded?June 1940.</sentence><sentence id="188">So I went to that period in this file, and I looked before it and here there was memos about Vidkun Quisling bringing 12 Germans in to see Rosenberg in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and eventually Quisling had been introduced to Hitler in a brief conversation and that then you go in back and had helped in the invasion...the Nazi invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">I immediately went degColonel Robert G.

(</sentence><sentence id="193">Information supplied by interviewee.)</sentence><sentence id="194">in to Story the next morning and told him, "Here's what I've got."</sentence><sentence id="195">And I had already written a very brief one-page memo on this.</sentence><sentence id="196">And I said, "Now my German isn't very good, so I'm not going to be able to vouch for all these, but I think you might just take this file to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>."</sentence><sentence id="197">He was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> the next day on Justice Jackson's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">private plane</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that the Amny had assigned him.</sentence><sentence id="198">He took that file back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and, of course, immediately it was on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> of everybody with respect to what had been found.</sentence><sentence id="199">And this is how I made my first impression on Jackson.</sentence><sentence id="200">And then I also showed him this brief that I had done and told him that it needed filling in as soon as I could get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And he said, "Well, I think we better hurry you along."</sentence><sentence id="202">So, well, meanwhile I had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but I hadn't gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> because we didn't know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was going to be the head of the trials in July.</sentence><sentence id="203">But I had gone in and made a few contacts and knew that some contacts that would be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="204">On August 15th, by that time the London agreement had been signed establishing the Tribunal and Office Chief of War Crimes as the main representative of the American...the Americans and so on.</sentence><sentence id="205">And then Major Baldwin, who is Colonel Storey's deputy, and I flew in in order to open the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">And we came into this bombed and shelled, huge <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span> as it was called out on the <span class="DLF">Fuertherstrasse</span>, and the first thing we had to do is the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had been broken in from shelling and bombing.</sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> itself was only had been hit in a couple of <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">It wasn't too badly full of debris except in one or two <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">But the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had come in and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were all dirty, and there was dust on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="210">And what I did was get a bunch of SS men from a nearby <span class="BUILDING">incarceration spot</span> or <span class="BUILDING">detention center</span> and we used these OSS men in order to clean up the <span class="BUILDING">Palace of Justice</span>, in order to make room for the trials.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: When did you start begin...to begin the interrogations and the preparations for the trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262">How did that begin?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well, I began preparations for the trial back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because of the materials that OSS had.</sentence><sentence id="264">And that would have been in...in June of 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: But here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="268">By the time you got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, you were doing what now?</sentence><sentence id="269">You had opened this <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">What were you doing there?</sentence></p></dialogue>

separate <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which is connected by a small <span class="DLF">passageway</span> was the place where the Trials were going to be held.</sentence><sentence id="369">An architect whose name I forget now, who worked for OSS, was pushed in very early and he immediately came up with the design and it required knocking out some <span class="DLF">walls</span> and to make the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> larger so there'd be room for the press and for visitors.</sentence><sentence id="370">And he did a terrific job on this, and also made <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> for the photographic apparatus that would be used and for the sound equipment.</sentence><sentence id="371">Every bit of the Trial was recorded on tape, so that there could never be any argument about what was said and also it helped the interpreters when they went back to check whether ...whether they'd interpreted quite accurately or not.</sentence><sentence id="372">It helped them a great deal to have this recording.</sentence><sentence id="373">The <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span>...as you entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> through the main <span class="DLF">door</span>, immediately to the left was the <span class="DLF">dock</span>, which is made up of two rows of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> where the defendants sat.</sentence><sentence id="374">And at the back of the <span class="DLF">dock</span>, there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> that went down four" floors to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> which then led over to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by a <span class="DLF">passageway</span> that had been built, and covered with with an awning so that they wouldn't get wet in case it was raining.</sentence><sentence id="375">Immediately beside the...the <span class="DLF">prisoners" dock</span> was the interpreting section which had about eight interpreters in it.</sentence><sentence id="376">And that was walled in by glass.</sentence><sentence id="377">And behind it there was this simultaneous interpretation equipment whereby if a person were speaking in German...that would be on <span class="BUILDING">Channel 1</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">Channel...we had a simultaneous interpreting system which is...I should go into perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="379">But Channel | was always a voice being spoken either in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> or wherever.</sentence><sentence id="380">And the interpreters would get this voice and translate it into the other three languages.</sentence><sentence id="381">If English were being spoken, it would be translated into German, French and Russian, and if Russian were being spoken, it would be translated into the other three languages, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="382">And these were very key people, and they were very good.</sentence><sentence id="383">A man by the name of Colonel Doscert, D-O-S-C-E-R-T had recruited the initial interpreters and helped train them in using this simultaneous translation equipment, which was very new.</sentence><sentence id="384">It had never been used before except for the <span class="BUILDING">International Labor Office</span>...I think, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> had tested it out.</sentence><sentence id="385">But when the...when <span class="BUILDING">IBM</span> heard that there was going to a four-power trial, they sent someone in to see my friend, Charlie Horsky, from

Charlie Horsky informed him about this system, and Jackson immediately became *Correction of Interviewee: Three floors.</sentence><sentence id="387">utterly impressed by it because during the...the negotiations for the London agreement, which was signed on August 8, 1945, they'd had to have interpreters in there translating from the American to the French to the Russian and so on.</sentence><sentence id="388">And it had been...slowed down the process very much, whereas if you had simultaneous translation, you could speed up the process by at least one half, by at least one-half.</sentence><sentence id="389">Well, to get back to the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>, after you got past the interpreters, went around, you came to the <span class="DLF">witness box</span> on the, also on the east side of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="390">Then on the south side of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>, there was a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> which had been built and behind that sat the eight judges, the four principal judges and their four...four alternates.</sentence><sentence id="391">Incidentally, in the construction of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, this architect first had the idea of sitting the alternate judges down just a little bit lower than the principal judges.</sentence><sentence id="392">And when Judge Parker"(r), the alternate American judge, saw that, he immediately screamed and, of course, Judge Biddle"", the American judge took it up with the American authorities, and they immediately corrected that particular error.</sentence><sentence id="393">The...in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">judges bench</span> were the official court stenographers and the persons representing...you might say the court officers representing each of the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">There was an American, a Britisher, Englishman, and the French, who would take any instructions the judges had or do any errands that the judges had and who would fetch witnesses and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="395">Then coming around a little bit further was the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> of the prosecution which faced toward the east and the judges were on the right and the defendants were on the left.</sentence><sentence id="396">The distance between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and the first judges maybe 12 feet between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and Goering in the corner was about 12, 13 feet, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="397">Behind the prosecutor were five...the <span

the...the prosecution, one to each of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">delegations</span> and one to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> so they could have their deputies sit there if they wished.</sentence><sentence id="399">Then behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">prosecution tables</span> was a... one row for people on the staff and and behind that was the press, a little rostrum and no one was supposed to from the press, was supposed to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that.</sentence><sentence id="400">And then up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>...they'd built a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> on this thing with oh, about 12 or 13 rows for VIPs, Very Important Persons, or for visitors or for those who didn't have passes to the main section, if they couldn't get in, they could watch the trial from up there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="440">A: The principal pressures that were on us were the pressures created by language, too few translators and an awful lot of prosecutors and judges who didn't understand the German language at all.</sentence><sentence id="441">So this slowed us down a great deal, and the fact that I knew a little German...I'd had 3 and a half years at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>, and I'd traveled over there a little bit...helped me a great deal and so I was able to help other attorneys and make suggestions to them as to how they can move a long a little bit faster.</sentence><sentence id="442">There was hardly any of the trial counsel who later appeared in <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, for the Americans, who spoke German, hudge John Parker.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: Well, the first defendant I prosecuted was Baldur von Schirach, actually, although I'd begun to make preparations on the Fritzsche case first.</sentence><sentence id="460">But since Fritzsche was the last man on the <span class="DLF">dock</span>, he was also the last person about whom we made a presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">Baldur von Schirach was in the second row of the <span class="DLF">dock</span>, but about the third man in.</sentence><sentence id="462">And so, a case against him was made a couple of weeks before the case on Fritzsche was made.</sentence><sentence id="463">And we were told, as we prepared our briefs, we were told to try to shorten them up a bit so we wouldn't take too much time.</sentence><sentence id="464">And most of us managed to get our presentations in in 2 hours against the individual defendants.</sentence><sentence id="465">Now before that, a tremendous amount of material had been put in about the development of the Nazi regime, about each of the invasions, about the War Crimes, and Crimes against Humanities practiced against had applications to civilians in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as well as outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span>, the slave labor, the Jews, the Gypsies, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="466">Actually, there was no presentation on Gypsies separately, which I think was a great mistake, and I have developed a chapter on that for my book which I'll bring you next time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: Can you tell us...actually before we go into the von Schirach prosecution, something of the controversy as you were involved in it or if you were involved in... particularly on the Crimes against Humanity charge and the whole question of the Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: Well, the...the Count One, the conspiracy to wage aggressive war, was alleged in very broad terms.</sentence><sentence id="478">Uh...Justice Jackson had this notion that the conspiracy reached way back even to the times of the Munich Putsch when Hitler formed the party program and so on.</sentence><sentence id="479">Now, of course, a lot of the defendants didn't become attached anything having to do with Hitler until sometime later.</sentence><sentence id="480">And we had the idea that under the Master Race doctrine, the Nazis had seized power, they had consolidated power.</sentence><sentence id="481">They had persecuted first Germans and then they'd persecuted Jews within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="482">And then, of course, they'd marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> where they really stepped up the persecution of minority people and particularly the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="483">And then after the war began, the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the press was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you might say, and there was a real iron curtain established.</sentence><sentence id="484">That is when Hitler really began to let loose with his doctrines of evacuating and eventually exterminating the Jewish people, Gypsies, even talked about Poles and Slavs as being of an inferior race that ought be cut down and their numbers used as slaves to the master race.</sentence><sentence id="485">After the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September 1939, Hitler held a conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> which was attended by a quite a number of people, including the head of the Abwehr, the counterintelligence who was actually never very much for Hitler, and later on turned against him, and was executed after the attempt on Hitler's life in "44.</sentence><sentence id="486">But he came out of that first meeting that Hitler had after the conquest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and told a witness that we had about how Hitler had said that when we go into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we don't come in order to establish a very efficient government and to please the Polish people and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="487">We came to put them in 0 their <span class="NPIP">place</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="488">And he spoke of...at that point, of exterminating Jews and evacuating them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="489">And actually, of course, the tremendous number of Poles and Jews were exterminated just after that campaign.</sentence><sentence id="490">But the...the main exterminations, of course, didn't take place until the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when you had the so-called Eintsatzgruppen of Himmler.</sentence><sentence id="491">The SS sent in four different uh..battle groups to follow behind the invading Germans and to liquidate all the people they considered enemies, and these, of course, were particularly Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="492">And altogether, my guess would be that a million people were executed well before the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, which a lot of people take as being the kind of the beginning of the Final Solution.</sentence><sentence id="493">In my opinion, that's entirely wrong.</sentence><sentence id="494">That Wannsee Conference actually brought in more departments, the economics department and a lot of others that hadn't been directly involved in any great extent and...and indicated to them that this Solution was going on and that they were expected to be a part of it, and that this meant there was a lot of assets that could be absorbed, etcetera.,</sentence><sentence id="495">etcetera.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="515">Q: How was this case developed during the trial?</sentence><sentence id="516">How did the lawyers for the prosecution develop the case against the case to prove that there had been a deliberate plot to exterminate the Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="519">A: Well, there was a whole group...I think it was first under a Major Walsh"", which worked on this subject in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and long before actually, OSS people had worked on developing papers on what was happening to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="520">But Major Walsh had this team. (</sentence><sentence id="521">Clearing Throat) And when they came...when we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, we found that the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of the...Julius Streicher, the main Jew-baiter of all time, were reasonably well intact and that and we captured a full set of the Stiirmer, the Stormer, which was his official publication.</sentence><sentence id="522">Now some copies of that, of course, had been available before hand outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had been kept and in some cases they hadn't.</sentence><sentence id="523">But this now offered a tremendous well of additional information.</sentence><sentence id="524">And the case against Streicher was relatively weak because we couldn't prove that he knew about the extermination of the Jews until some information came in the war through the Stiirmer, that he was talking about the Israelitische Wochenblatt, a weekly published by Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">And in there, the editors of this newspaper had said some history about the extermination of the Jews, and Streicher in the Sturmer published some of this and underneath, it said, "This is no Goddamn Jewish lie."</sentence><sentence id="526">And so that is what when we found that out, we had some additional materials.</sentence><sentence id="527">And that was not used until his cross examination by the British, and it was used very effectively.</sentence><sentence id="528">And got him into a real bind and made him obviously appear to be...having lied all the way through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: Tell us more about the cases in which you were directly involved during this first trial?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="541">A: When I was assigned to work on the case of Baldur von Schirach, the Youth... Youth Leader, another attorney and some other and some of his people helping him, Major Hartley Murray had developed considerable amount of materials on the Hitler Youth and on Baldur von Maj or William F. Walsh, Assistant Trial Counsel, U.S.A. Information supplied by interviewee.</sentence><sentence id="542">1 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schirach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">And really Major Hartley Murray should have been assigned that case, but I think they somehow wanted to throw me an easier case than the Schirach"* case and so I was assigned to it.</sentence><sentence id="544">Baldur von Schirach had formed a Nazi group or the youth group about 1925 or so when he was himself in...in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="545">And Hitler heard about it and asked him to come for an interview, and Hitler made him the Hitler Youth Leader.</sentence><sentence id="546">Also Hitler's main photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, had a daughter by the name of Henrietta, and Hitler introduced Schirach to Henrietta Hoffmann and they began...they were married.</sentence><sentence id="547">So that was another thing which brought Hitler...Schirach into fairly close proximity to...to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="548">He developed the Hitler Youth before Hitler came to power to a very substantial group.</sentence><sentence id="549">And they got songwriters to write some marching songs for them and it became a group which was put into the parades that the Nazis put on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> every November to celebrate the Nazi Putsch of 1923.</sentence><sentence id="550">And Schirach was more and more brought to the fore in connection with these things.</sentence><sentence id="551">As soon as Hitler...as the Nazis came to power, Hitler appointed Schirach to be the National Youth Leader and he was given such power that he was able to destroy the youth organizations of the opposition which were fairly strong actually.</sentence><sentence id="552">And finally, he even took over the Catholic youth organizations and forced them into the Hitler Youth.</sentence><sentence id="553">After more indoctrination of various kinds and so on, he made agreements with Htler...or with Himmler, the head of the SS, that some of the Youth members, Hitler Youth members who had shown great promise would be put directly into the SS.</sentence><sentence id="554">And also he made an arrangement with the head of the Armed Forces that Hitler youth would get some preferences about indoctrination into the Armed Forces.</sentence><sentence id="555">So he was well involved in connection with having polluted the mind of young people.</sentence><sentence id="556">When the war came along, he continued in this work until Hitler called him down to (clearing throat) Berchtesgaden one time and told him that he wanted him to become the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>...that he wasn't...hadn't been satisfied with the earlier leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and he had alienated an awful lot of Austrians and wouldn't he accept that position.</sentence><sentence id="557">Of course, a request from Hitler is like a demand and Von Schirach went and became the Gauleiter and the rank governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">Actually, by the time... uh...Schirach got that position, most of the Jews had already been pushed out of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and there probably weren't...in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which had a half a million Jews, there probably weren't more than a couple of hundred thousand left at that time.</sentence><sentence id="559">But Schirach had the idea of having a Youth conference of the youth...of leaders of youth from various <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> in September of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="560">And while addressing them, he said, "If I have sent thousands upon thousands of Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> of the east, then I consider it a contribution to European civilization."</sentence><sentence id="561">Now that speech was published the next day in the Voelkische Beobachter, which is the official Nazi paper in in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, as well as in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">And, of course that was used very early in the briefs that Hartley Murray and others had prepared.</sentence><sentence id="563">And it is what I use as my perovation, my last words, in making the case against von Schirach.</sentence><sentence id="564">I said, "And in closing, your Honors,"...and then I just repeated those words that he had stated.</sentence><sentence id="565">I was very surprised that he didn't get a sentence of more than 20 years because he had done a lot of things, but I think one of the reasons was his behavior in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> during the trial.</sentence><sentence id="566">He became very open and he made releases to the press, and Correction of Interviewee: Fritzsche.</sentence><sentence id="567">2 he indicated that Hitler had betrayed the German people and he'd betrayed him.</sentence><sentence id="568">And that he wanted to make amends, as far as he could, although he realized that was not possible and so on.</sentence><sentence id="569">And I think this influenced the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="570">I don't know, but I think it did.</sentence><sentence id="571">Otherwise, I think they would have sentenced him to death, which is what I had expected he would get.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the case was largely developed...uh...on a subject by subject basis to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="616">And it was only later that it was broken down to be directed against individual defendants.</sentence><sentence id="617">So for example, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, in July and August, a large number of German documents had been found.</sentence><sentence id="618">British Foreign Office documents and the Rosenberg files that I mentioned before and a group that was working on...for instance, the (clearing throat) occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in March of 1938, they would have gone back into these files and dug up documents that had to do with that.</sentence><sentence id="619">They would have gotten keys to newspaper articles about it.</sentence><sentence id="620">The Austrian case, of course, was rather out in the open because that was a case of marching in.</sentence><sentence id="621">But on the other hand, what happened at the conference where Schuschnigg, the Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, was brought into the Berchtesgaden and a lot of pressure applied to him, that we wouldn't have known about until we got a summary that had been made by someone who was present, a German assistant to Hitler, one of his adjutants or someone else who made a summary of the conference, and how the pressure was put on or...Now we did have interrogations made during this preliminary period of all, not only of the prospective defendants, but other people about how things had happened.</sentence><sentence id="622">I observed a lot of those interrogations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">But we never...we seldom used that interrogation material in the actual trial because we had better materials by that time.</sentence><sentence id="624">Now in a few cases, they did in order to confront witnesses on cross examinations. "</sentence><sentence id="625">Now during your preliminary interrogations you did or you didn't admit this.</sentence><sentence id="626">Why didn't you admit it?</sentence><sentence id="627">Or didn't you say something different?</sentence><sentence id="628">Uh...That gave us quite an advantage which you often don't have where the defendant, prospective defendant can claim the right against self- incrimination.</sentence><sentence id="629">Now, we were charged into the Charter"*...the prosecution of this charter, with the obligation of interrogating possible defendants before they were interrogated...before they were indicted.</sentence><sentence id="630">So there's...there's a little different approach there than there would be an Anglo-Saxon law.</sentence><sentence id="631">Uh...So there's a whole group that was working on the various aggressive war charges, the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="632">And with their research analysts these lawyers would scan documents and the research analysts would write what was called the Staff Evidence Analysis, an SEA.</sentence><sentence id="633">And at the top of that it would give the name of the document or what the document was about, what defendants were mentioned in the document what other leading Germans were mentioned in the document...before it even went into what was shown by the document.</sentence><sentence id="634">And then there would be a brief analysis in there as to what the document showed.</sentence><sentence id="635">Now at this point the document had not been translated so that anybody in English could read it.</sentence><sentence id="636">These were German-speaking research analysts, most of them refugees from the Nazi regime who were given briefings as to what we were looking for, and then they would go into the documents and they would write these SEAs and they would come to mostly English speaking lawyers and English speaking "4The Charter of the International Military Tribunal.</sentence><sentence id="637">Information supplied by interviewee.</sentence><sentence id="638">4 lawyers say, "That's good.</sentence><sentence id="639">That doesn't belong" to anything," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="640">And then they would...we would either have a good document translated or we would say, "Look, see if you can find some other documents around that document that bear on the same subject which are even more telling in their...of...in the proof they give."</sentence><sentence id="641">So we had these various kind of subteams of the prosecution team who worked on these things, and actually the British and the Americans mixed some of the teams so we had on some of the teams Peter Calvocoressi who is a British commander, wrote a book"(r) on the Nuremberg trials later.</sentence><sentence id="642">He was...he worked with Telford Taylor in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in counterintelligence during the end of the war, and he came right over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> when Taylor came over.</sentence><sentence id="643">So we had some...some very close collaboration there.</sentence><sentence id="644">The staff tended to divide between those who were working on aggressive war, those who were working on the maltreatment of people in the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span>, including...and then we had a separate group working on the persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="645">But they worked very close together with the group working on the total mistreatment of civilians and minorities in the...well, majorities in the case of the Soviet Union" in the...the occupied countries.</sentence><sentence id="646">Now the Germans were tremendous document keepers and very few documents were destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="647">Orders were made to destroy the documents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> themselves, but in some cases this wasn't even done, or in some cases the Russians advanced so quickly that they...they still found lists of people who had been exterminated or some of the documents about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> after they'd occupied it.</sentence><sentence id="648">And there is a death book, I think from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, which used to be...which was...I've seen it not only over there, but I saw it in the archives and I think it's now been taken out to __*(r) You might want to see it sometime.</sentence><sentence id="649">But in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> you have a listing of people who were killed each day, and this was partly kept by a Kapo, a Kapo, a...one of the prisoners, one of the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> himself.</sentence><sentence id="650">And using a certain amount of imagination, he listed the name and the number of the inmate and under cause of death he put each case "Herzschlag"-- heart...heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="651">So here you have...and then what he did was enter | every minute throughout the day or if that...more people had been killed than that, he'd enter a number at this point.</sentence><sentence id="652">But he did everything kind of alphabetically and to the extent he could and in these groups of these time groupings, so that anybody who got this book could tell that something was going on besides people just dying of natural causes.</sentence><sentence id="653">And that book you might be interested in getting hold of.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="720">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="721">So tell us more now about...you're building a case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: Well, all these Staff Evidence Analysis were passed to all the lawyers and we all read them and so we had a general idea what is happening.</sentence><sentence id="725">Then a very important person at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, Commander Whitney Harris, who wrote the Tyranny on Trial, is a good friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="726">He and I decided that we ought to organize some briefings at night of all the prosecutors just generally about what was the nature of the Nazi regime and what was developing in these various study groups.</sentence><sentence id="727">And so we held... up until the time that indictments were going to be issued, we must have held about 18 of this nightly meetings.</sentence><sentence id="728">We didn't hold them every night, but maybe two a week, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="729">And for instance, I presented an organized presentation on the "Fuehrerprinzip", the leadership principal.</sentence><sentence id="730">How in the Nazi party, theoretically, you had the leader at the top and the passing down of the orders and all that.</sentence><sentence id="731">Now actually it turned out that things didn't work quite the way the Nazi organization book specified but at least that was the theory then, and that was exchanged at these meetings.</sentence><sentence id="732">So that helped us keep abreast of each other, and I think Whitney Harris and I are both very proud of having done that.</sentence><sentence id="733">Jackson came and spoke to one of them.</sentence><sentence id="734">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Storey</span> held weekly staff conferences.</sentence><sentence id="735">And at those staff conferences, the people in the Documentation Division would report on various things.</sentence><sentence id="736">And as they began to develop rough preliminary trial briefs, these would be available if you wanted to see them, but normally speaking they weren't exchanged...that it was felt that this is getting out material that wasn't particularly thoroughly checked yet.</sentence><sentence id="737">It might get into the wrong hands, the press and so on.</sentence><sentence id="738">But I could go and find out what was the status of the brief in another <span class="NPIP">section</span> or they could come and say, "What's the status of the brief on destruction of the trade unions and the creation of the <span class="REGION">German Labor Front</span>," and I would show them everything I had.</sentence><sentence id="739">So these briefs were created in advance of the trial, and from them Jackson while even while they were in preliminary shape, Jackson began to draft the indictment.</sentence><sentence id="740">And so David Maxwell-Fyfe"", later Lord Kilmuir, the Lord...the Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> came over to see what Jackson was doing because between the time of the London Agreement on August 8th and the issuance of the indictment on about October 17th, or something like that, of 1945, there was a great deal of work had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="741">And the...the French and the Russians didn't come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> until, oh, sometime in late August or September. (</sentence><sentence id="742">Clearing Throat) Well, and...and certainly not even until September or early October.</sentence><sentence id="743">And Jackson didn't know very much about the two...about one of the defendants the Russians wanted to have indicted and who was indicted, Fritzsche.</sentence><sentence id="744">Or even about Raeder, who was the Grand Admiral of the Navy, but who'd kind of fallen out with Hitler in 1943, and kind of become inactive.</sentence><sentence id="745">So these became things that had to be quickly developed into some kind of a form degdegMr.</sentence><sentence id="746">David Maxwell-Fyfe, Deputy Chief Prosecutor, <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="747">6 so that Jackson could help draft his brief and so we could have materials to put in the brief on these other subjects.</sentence><sentence id="748">Now the Russians insisted on putting in a lot of materials about what happened in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, including the Katyn business within... The French brought in a lot of things, including that 7 and a half francs were stolen by someone on the <span class="DLF">street corner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">It was a tremendous detail that the French brought in about what had been purloined and spoliated in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">And they insisted on some of this being put into the indictment, which made the indictment overly long.</sentence><sentence id="751">In my view, it was overly long even from what we put into it, but you put in additional amounts of the French and the Russians...and the Soviets insisted on putting in, and you got too long an indictment.</sentence><sentence id="752">Uh...The Americans...(clearing throat)....it was just understood that since Jackson had pushed for the trials and had been the main leader in negotiating the London Agreement, that the Americans would take the conspiracy count, Count One, and present most of the materials on that.</sentence><sentence id="753">After we presented a fair amount of materials on that, it became so clear that the British had a lot to do because they were working on Count Two, which was the waging of aggressive war, that we better combine some of these so actually we had some presentations during that aggressive war part by British counsel in addition to American counsel.</sentence><sentence id="754">And the British and the Americans got on extremely well together in the trials.</sentence><sentence id="755">I think we had...there was a mutual admiration at the top as well as down in the ranks.</sentence><sentence id="756">Uh...a lot of mutual respect.</sentence><sentence id="757">The British had only Sir David Maxwell...Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, and about six barristers.</sentence><sentence id="758">But they were superior.</sentence><sentence id="759">They were terrific.</sentence><sentence id="760">And they...on cross examination, for example, did better jobs on the whole than we did.</sentence><sentence id="761">Now Jackson was not a good cross examiner.</sentence><sentence id="762">Uh...That was not his <span class="BUILDING">fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">He was a great advocate.</sentence><sentence id="764">He knew how to express things in the English language with a flavor and a...uh..stirring vocabulary which no one else had.</sentence><sentence id="765">Sir Hartley Shawcross, who was the main chief British prosecutor in the...in a tribute to Jackson, after Jackson died in 1954, said that there was no...no one among the British staff that equaled him in terms of his capacity to use the English language, which is rather interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: You've started telling us about some of the...the defense team.</sentence><sentence id="810">Would you tell us more about the people involved some more about Jackson and Storey and some of the others?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="814">Justice Jackson had gotten to know a man by the name of Sidney Alderman very well because of Alderman's presentations before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="815">He was the General Counsel of the Southern Railroad, and he asked Alderman to become one of his top deputies and to assist him.</sentence><sentence id="816">Uh...I first met Alderman when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="817">Uh...Alderman was a...had an incredible capability to read an awful lot of materials that were submitted to him to digest them and to make a coherent, relatively succinct statement out of them.</sentence><sentence id="818">Jackson relied on him a great deal in terms of aggressive war counts, to go over the materials that had been found, to stimulate the attorneys to find more materials, and then to make the final briefs and then for Alderman to make almost all those presentations with several exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="819">And several of those exceptions were British who were brought in and made presentations on aggressive war.</sentence><sentence id="820">And I'm not sure who the American would be that made some as well, but I think there was one.</sentence><sentence id="821">Colonel Storey had done work during the war that had come to the attention of Justice Jackson, and he'd been a...gone abroad for OSS on a thing or two.</sentence><sentence id="822">And Jackson thought he'd be a good man to head up the Documentation 7 Division, and brought him in and shipped him directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="823">And...the amount of materials that few of us...few research analysts and a few others found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was so much greater in terms of volume and relevance to what was being found by the Joint British- American team in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> based on the documents they had, that Jackson began to insist on bringing more people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="824">And a lot of them didn't like...or into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and most...lot of them didn't like to come because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> life was very nice and they didn't think Paris life was so great.</sentence><sentence id="825">But he did finally bring a group into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and within 2 or 3 weeks, got them to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">And Colonel Storey was then made Executive Trial Counsel, and after the indictment was in the last stages, he was through his deputies and associates, was probably contributing more toward what went into the indictment than any single person so it became logical for Jackson to appoint him Executive Trial Counsel.</sentence><sentence id="827">And what Storey did was first prepare a basis for informing the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as to how we'd captured these documents, to how we'd process them, and so on so we didn't have to prove in each case the document source and it would have delayed the trial tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="828">So a major by the man of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coogan</span>, Major Coogan, had been appointed the person to go and search out files in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">Actually, he didn't speak German, so he had some assistants who actually helped him a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="830">And he brought....he with the man who helped find the...or bring back the Rosenberg files, and a number of other files to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then take them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="831">Then he left the staff, and he never presented the case or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="832">Major Baldwin, later Colonel Baldwin, became (clearing throat) Storey's assistant and he and I became quite close and he asked me to or we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> together to open the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> you might say...if I would like to share a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with him, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="833">And when it came to presenting cases I'm sure he put in a good word for me.</sentence><sentence id="834">And he'd presented the case against Hans Frank, the Governor-General of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and before our presentations why we'd critique each other back in our little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we stayed so as to try to perfect our presentations.</sentence><sentence id="835">Baldwin was extremely valuable to Storey because he took a awful lot of administrative detail, and this gave Storey legs you might say to work more on getting materials in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="836">Another very important person was Colonel Leonard Wheeler, Jr. of whom you have a little letter in there that he wrote about to me.</sentence><sentence id="837">He became...he's the head of the Documentation Division in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">And when they...he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, he was made Storey's deputy.</sentence><sentence id="839">And either Jackson or else Storey made the decision that they should sit together almost back to back in the head...in this central large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of the Documentation Division so as to prove that these two staffs had merged on the one hand and on the other hand to show that there was complete trust about exchanging materials.</sentence><sentence id="840">And they worked very well together.</sentence><sentence id="841">Storey decided to present to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> some of the cases against the criminal organizations, and Wheeler presented the case against suppression of the <span class="BUILDING">Christian churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="842">Then both of them left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in January of 1946, along with a lot of other people who were there and left behind only about four or five of us who had developed materials and cases and so on to assist Jackson and tie him down.</sentence><sentence id="843">That's kind of how the staff developed and how it worked.</sentence><sentence id="844">There was a tremendous number of lawyers who were a little unhappy about how things went and if obviously they didn't...perhaps didn't get as big a title as they wanted or something like that, an awful lot of them wanted to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="845">They'd been overseas or one thing or another, and some of them that I'm sure could have done very good work had they stayed on left as soon as they'd made 8 their presentations and a lot of them who weren't assigned to make a presentation before the Tribunal immediately left, so that left the rest of us with more research analysts than we'd had before and a smaller staff.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: What was the atmosphere like in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> while these trials were going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: Well, that varied a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="882">When we first came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> which hadn't been shelled and so on, life wasn't too bad except that an awful lot of people from the main part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, which had been bombed, were moved out to these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">And so <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were filled up in many cases two and three times what they normally had been before, so there was an awful lot of crowding in this sense.</sentence><sentence id="884">The downtown part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, had been bombed to a fare-thee-well.</sentence><sentence id="885">There were very few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> standing.</sentence><sentence id="886">There were one or two where part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was standing and I recall having gone into those...uh..a time or time either to get witnesses or because somebody local was holding a party and...uh...knew that if we were invited we'd be able to bring some whiskey or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="887">During the first days, you could hardly walk during parts...into parts of the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="888">The fact is you couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="889">The court photographer by the name of Ray D'Assasrio, has developed a book called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuermberg</span>:Damals/Heute: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, Then and Now.</sentence><sentence id="890">And this has gone through a number of editions in...uh...in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="891">He took a tremendous number of pictures of various important places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> then and now.</sentence><sentence id="892">After they're rebuilt, he took it and he has these on opposite pages.</sentence><sentence id="893">And he's made a small fortune out of this book.</sentence><sentence id="894">Incidently, I have a copy of it if you...if you don't.</sentence><sentence id="895">But you should get a copy of that book because it shows the circumstances in which the trial, you might say, in which the trial grew.</sentence><sentence id="896">The <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was standing in most cases, but in some cases some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turrets</span> had been blown of on it, and some of...much of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was pockmarked by explosions, either from bombs or from shells.</sentence><sentence id="897">And there were...some cases you...even when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> 20, 25 years after the trial, you could see how...where these parts of the old <span class="DLF">city wall</span> had been bricked up and fenced over because they had a different sheen than what the...the old <span class="DLF">wall</span> had.</sentence><sentence id="898">Uh...The <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> when we first came there, which became the center for most of the visitors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> passing through.</sentence><sentence id="899">We were there for the first week of our stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in August.</sentence><sentence id="900">And the front part of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to the right of the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was still...a bomb had fallen and just blown it to smithereens.</sentence><sentence id="901">And by the time we got there they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffolding</span> up and were beginning to repair it.</sentence><sentence id="902">And when we went up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on the fourth floor we had to walk on little planks holding onto guide rails as we crossed part of this <span class="DLF">chasm</span> that had been created by this bomb.</sentence><sentence id="903">Uh... The amount of effort which was put into restoring that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span>, and some of the other...the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> was incredible.</sentence><sentence id="904">I mean whole battalions of engineers were sent in.</sentence><sentence id="905">Materials were flown from all <span class="NPIP">over</span>.</sentence><sentence id="906">Of course, we lacked glass, and there was very little glass made in German, so we took over the <span class="BUILDING">Belgium glass market</span> for a few months in order to put <span class="DLF">windows</span> throughout the <span class="BUILDING">court house</span> as well as into the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were bombed out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: Well, mostly the...the Germans were so shell shocked from the process of the bombings and all... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had been bombed incredibly and a tremendous number of people had been killed.</sentence><sentence id="938">I don't know, I think next to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had gotten a big a hit as almost any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="939">Well, that's not quite true.</sentence><sentence id="940">There was some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> that had got it as well.</sentence><sentence id="941">But people were on very poor rations.</sentence><sentence id="942">You could see it in their faces.</sentence><sentence id="943">You could buy anything for a few packs of cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="944">There was quite a traffic in...whatever people had been able to save from their <span class="NPIP">bombed out places</span>, they'd trade it off with farmers, peasants around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in order to get enough to get enough to barely pass eating.</sentence><sentence id="945">Actually, the Americans sent in rations and the Germans were...the rations were fortified by the Americans for some time.</sentence><sentence id="946">One reason we were able to attract so many of the people around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> who spoke both languages to help us in the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> was that they immediately got a different ration.</sentence><sentence id="947">And one reason the defense counsel were delighted after they were put on a list, the defense counsel on which the defendants could choose.</sentence><sentence id="948">One of the things they were very happy about is that they got a very good ration.</sentence><sentence id="949">Now their ration wasn't up to ours, but they did get an inferior brand of cigarettes and they got a mild amount of whiskey I think, probably an off-brand, but they also got a basic...food rations.</sentence><sentence id="950">And who...with whomever they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> they would share this, of course, and then at lunch, we built a defense counsel mess.</sentence><sentence id="951">And they would stack up on food in the defense counsel mess, but for breakfast and for dinners they ate in their own...in the lodgings they'd found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="952">A couple of the defense counsels came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, including Streicher's counsel.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: Would you tell us about that, and about how you dealt with that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="975">A: Well, I had known from my work with OSS and from contacts I made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and elsewhere that there were Germans who'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and who had survived who would make supposedly pretty good witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="976">So, for instance, one witness by the name of Matthias Lex, L-E-X, was the head of the Shoemakers" Union of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">And he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>"!</sentence><sentence id="978">steadily from 1933 until 1938, 5 years.</sentence><sentence id="979">In the process, he had seen happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> tremendous number of things.</sentence><sentence id="980">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, he'd seen the opposition come in, and he'd made an affidavit for me in which he'd listed by name, 40 people including a bishop whose name I forget right now, but he listed various top leaders who'd been confined in roughly the periods that he'd recalled that they'd been confined in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">And then he included...then he told about how, after a certain period of time, Jews were begun to be brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> after Goering had begun his nefarious work in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="982">And likewise he mentioned that the Bibelforscher, the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="983">"Correction of Interviewee: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camp Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">0 Bible Students, that there were 150 of them which had been brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and about 150 Gypsies that were there at a certain time.</sentence><sentence id="985">So all of this I put into this affidavit.</sentence><sentence id="986">And this led to other people following up on those leads to get a lot...a lot of further materials.</sentence><sentence id="987">I don't mean to say that this is the only thing.</sentence><sentence id="988">It was one of the things that helped a lot.</sentence><sentence id="989">And there had been some indications that what we should do is put on some of the former leaders of the Weimar Republic as to tell what had happened to them and that we should put on some of the leaders of the Jewish organizations outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to talk about what had happened.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="990">This was pretty much voted down on the theory that we had better evidence on the one hand, and number two, that these people would be long winded, if not garrulous, and that it would prolong the trial a lot more.</sentence><sentence id="991">So what we did was use the information we got from these people and those cases in which it was useful to help us with leads and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="992">And on the whole the trial was based on contemporaneous German documents or upon (clearing throat) witnesses who had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or who'd been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="993">Now in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we got the commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> who was not captured until about April of 1946, and he wasn't there during the early part, but we got him, and the British sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and the American's interrogated him.</sentence><sentence id="994">And he just laid it out in black and white as to how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> was made, how it was organized, and how many people were exterminated there, and the whole story on the Gypsies... which and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="995">His name was Rudolph Hoess, H-O-E-S-S, and after he was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where he was tried, convicted, sentenced and before he was executed, he wrote a book called "Commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>."</sentence><sentence id="996">And that book has in it...some of the materials on the Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="997">Actually, I was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="998">He didn't give the material on the Gypsies while he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> because he was not asked unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="999">But when he was...in this book he wrote the full story on what happened to the Gypsies and on these materials, people like Martin Gilbert and others later found a lot more materials, and that whole case on the Gypsies had developed a lot more than it ever was developed at the Nuremberg trials, unfortunately.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1011">A: I talked to people who did talk to him.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And suggested some questions, but I didn't...I was not in the Interrogation Division, and by the time he came the... Actually, he was called as a defense witness by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the top SS man on the <span class="DLF">dock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1014">But we'd interrogated him as well during the cross examination of him.</sentence><sentence id="1015">We just put in this affidavit and asked him if he would like to correct any part of it, and he said 1 no.</sentence><sentence id="1016">And then a few of the highlights were brought out for the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and that was that.</sentence><sentence id="1017">There was some incredible German witnesses as you may know from reading the judgment.</sentence><sentence id="1018">One was a man by the name of Graebe, G-R-A-E-B-E, who had been the leader of a <span class="BUILDING">German factory</span> that was established in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1019">I forget the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1020">But he talked about how he was required to release Jews who were working in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and that he heard about how they were being exterminated and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1021">So one day he just went out to where he heard they were being shot and put into <span class="DLF">trenches</span> actually and buried in <span class="DLF">trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And he went out there and before the SS prevented him, he was able to watch a whole sequence of this go on.</sentence><sentence id="1023">So he became a witness and testified at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and quite a bit of his testimony is reproduced in the actual judgment of the Tribunal, as indicating how these Einsatzgruppen worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1024">And of course, we had tremendously impressive evidence on that subject from Otto Ohlendorf, who was the head of one of the four Einsatzgruppen himself.</sentence><sentence id="1025">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohlendorf</span> was not as the big boss at the top of that group in the same position to talk about what had happened in a specific extermination of a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, that Graebe was able to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="1026">So you see we have this combination of materials, contemporaneous documents, a few German witnesses on whom we had materials.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohlendorf</span>, he knew that he eventually was going to be tried and that he'd get the rope, he talked quite freely.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And then we had people like Graebe who talked quite freely or talked very freely without any reservation.</sentence><sentence id="1029">And if I'm not mistaken Graebe and if not, someone like him, found it very uncomfortable living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> just after the war and went to...to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and that a <span class="DLF">street</span> is named for him and a statue has been erected for him.</sentence><sentence id="1030">Now if it isn't 1 can check up on who that is, but it's one of...someone like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: The witness I'm trying to think about, whose name escapes me unfortunately, was our our first witness and he was the deputy to head of the Abwehr", and he'd been on the list to be extermin...to be executed by Hitler's hangman after the attempt on Hitler's life.</sentence><sentence id="1054">He was our first witness and was able to give tremendously impressive testimony.</sentence><sentence id="1055">But it took so much time.</sentence><sentence id="1056">It took, you know, nearly a day by the time the defense was done cross examining him.</sentence><sentence id="1057">Now actually he was not cross examined by the defense as much, to show that things were wrong that he said, as he was questioned in a couple of cases to try to bring out materials that helped particular defendants.</sentence><sentence id="1058">For instance, Schacht was able to...Schacht's attorney was able to use him to indicate that Schacht had nothing to do with this and that and the other thing, and that Schacht was also suspected...was known to be a part of the opposition, but he didn't dare show his face very much and therefore, he wasn't very obvious as some of the others were.</sentence><sentence id="1059">I'll bring a note on some of the leading witnesses at the next time if you like.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: What else would you like to tell us about that first trial before we move on or the first set of the trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1069">*degGeneral Erwin Langlesen.</sentence><sentence id="1070">Information supplied by interviewee.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1072">A: Well, after we'd presented...developed the case on a subject basis, such as I've described, the different invasions, persecution of minorities, persecution of the Jews, spoilation, stealing of art treasures, Germanization, and so on, the next thing was _____ defendants!</sentence><sentence id="1073">names has been mentioned in these documents, but it hasn't been pulled together.</sentence><sentence id="1074">The <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> has a very small staff.</sentence><sentence id="1075">We'd better be sure that the...this is pulled together for the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> and for history.</sentence><sentence id="1076">So Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe indicated to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> that the prosecution at a certain stage would like to make individual presentations, gathering together this evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1077">This had already been done in December before the Christmas holidays with respect to the slave labor case, with respect to Speer, defendant Speer, and the Defendant Sauckel.</sentence><sentence id="1078">And I'm sure that this had impressed the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that that those two men were brought in in dramatic colors.</sentence><sentence id="1079">So Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe said to the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span>, "We'd like to do a similar thing with respect to other individuals."</sentence><sentence id="1080">So some of us were assigned different things and Commander Albrecht from the Navy presented the case on Goering, and the British presented the case on von Ribbentrop and, so on it went.</sentence><sentence id="1081">And I managed to get two out of the 22 presentations that...which I thought was pretty good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1092">Q: Tell us about those two presentations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1094">A: Well, I had partly discussed them in the case of Baldur Von Schirach, the Youth Leader, and the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> earlier, and of course, Hans Fritzsche who was the radio propagandist.</sentence><sentence id="1095">And I gave you a bit on that before too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1098">Q: The first set of trials as they wound down, the Nuremberg Trials you began to prepare for subsequent trials.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1100">A: You said set of trials.</sentence><sentence id="1101">There was only one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1105">You're right.</sentence><sentence id="1106">As the Trial wound down, you began...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Actually, when the trial was...the prosecution was still putting on his case...people who had developed different materials were either going to leave or they were going to be used for something else, and so I made this recommendation to Jackson that we start to think about subsequent trials and he immediately made me Director of the Subsequent Proceedings Division.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And from that time on, which was already in the same month the Trial opened, November of 1945, from then on we...a small group of us started to prepare materials and watch for materials that people on the main case found which would lead toward possible trials later on.</sentence><sentence id="1112">And for instance, on experiments on human beings, medical experiments...Now there was early materials that had been found on that during the first trial, but they weren't terribly extensive, but they were sufficient enough so that they were made a part of the case in chief and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1113">I suggested to Alexander Hardy that he might want...when he came over at about April of 1946 that he might want to get in on..in on the medical cases that I thought he...it was the kind of thing that would interest him.</sentence><sentence id="1114">He took it over and developed a tremendous case which led to the materials that are now reproduced in the green volumes, volumes | and 2, about all the various medical experiments, a lot of which weren't 3 touched at all in the main trial.</sentence><sentence id="1115">The second case...second subsequent proceedings was against Milch, which I thought was a mistake because it used up a whole Tribunal of three judges for one man and...but he was involved in medical experiments because as the deputy of Goering for material Air Force procurement, he'd had under him this research and they thought maybe some of these experiments would have some...some use to the air forces...the high altitude experiments, cold water experiments, etc.,</sentence><sentence id="1116">etc.</sentence><sentence id="1117">So Milch was tried on that count plus the use of slave labor because he was on the Central Planning Board, along with Speer and Sauckel, the head of the Plenipotentiary for Labor Recruitment.</sentence><sentence id="1118">And that those materials from the labor recruitment was plainly done at a time when there was obvious tremendous number of slave labors were being used, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates were being used, etc.,</sentence><sentence id="1119">etc.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Now the details of a lot of those cases were not developed until the secondary trials, the next 12 trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1132">Q: Can you talk a little more about how these cases were developed?</sentence><sentence id="1133">The people you've brought in...you've mentioned some...to develop them, and what the atmosphere was, political pressures and otherwise, as you develop them...a very different atmosphere.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1136">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1137">Before the first trial was over, tensions were already developing between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1138">Telford Taylor, General Telford Taylor who succeeded Jackson, had hoped very much to arrange at least one more international trial with the four powers working together and the judges representing the four powers, four Allied powers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1139">This quickly disappeared as a possibility because of this tension.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And the Russians after the first trial left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1141">They left a liaison person or two behind, but they absolutely cleared out, including taking some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that we supplied to them and all their files and all the rest of this business.</sentence><sentence id="1142">Which is...they were certainly entitled to take their files.</sentence><sentence id="1143">But they weren't very cooperative with respect to any later trials.</sentence><sentence id="1144">So we decided to go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Now actually the French were in such bad shape from the occupation by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they could not afford to do very much and they tried an awful lot of collaborators and French people and the few Germans that they got their hands on, but an awful lot of French justice was, I'm afraid, hanging people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or shooting them right on hand without trial.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And later on, as things quieted down, and they wanted to hold trials they really were short handed.</sentence><sentence id="1147">One of their people, a fellow by the name of Charles Gerthoffer, was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and was a liaison to the economics cases.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I helped him prepare the case against Roechling, which was one of the fourth largest enterprises in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it had been very active in using slave labors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurttemberg</span> and in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>, what later became the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1149">So we did help the French in that respect with a trial or two.</sentence><sentence id="1150">The British became so involved in reconstituting things that they conducted very few trials except those involving British officers.</sentence><sentence id="1151">And the one involving von Manstein, which was a...who was a leading German marshall in the invasion of the Soviet Union as well as several other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and he was prosecuted, actually, by Major Elwyn Jones, who was on the British Delegation during the first trial, who later prosecuted him.</sentence><sentence id="1152">He was the only Labour Member of Parliament who was in the...permanently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1153">He went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after this trial and got into the labor government on two different occasions and became the Lord Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1154">And his title is Lord Elwyn Jones.</sentence><sentence id="1155">He wouldn't 4 take another name.</sentence><sentence id="1156">He was originally a Welshman.</sentence><sentence id="1157">Well, that's a digression, but that indicates a little something there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: In these trials you were dealing particularly with things such as medical experiments, crimes against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals...those kinds of things to a level of detail.</sentence><sentence id="1181">Can you tell us about that and tell us about some other witnesses?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1184">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1185">Well, I think I might just go down the list of the cases.</sentence><sentence id="1186">The first trial, first subsequent trial involved the medical experiments.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And incidentally in that trial, one of the defendants was a woman.</sentence><sentence id="1188">And the only woman" who was tried in the Nuremberg trials.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And she received a sentence for a term of years.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I forget what.</sentence><sentence id="1191">The second trial was against Erhard Milch who is Goering's deputy and he was sentenced to a life in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1192">The third trial was the so-called Justice case and it was a case against people who'd been...the chief judges of <span class="BUILDING">peoples courts</span> or the prosecutors in <span class="BUILDING">peoples courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1193">And the film which was later done with Spencer Tracy on the...Justice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> involved that trial and a very small part of that trial if you will recall and that trial was the main prosecutor in that underneath General Taylor was a former Republican Congressman by the name of Charles LaFollette.</sentence><sentence id="1194">As far as I know the only former congressman that appeared in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1195">The fourth trial was a so- called...the fourth trial was, I think, the Einsatzgruppen case, which was tried by Benjamin Ferencz as the main prosecutor under Taylor, and he's written a book since called, Less than Slaves.</sentence><sentence id="1196">After he'd presented this case against the main Einsatzgruppen leaders who had gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and killed so many people, he became head of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization.</sentence><sentence id="1197">And built up enough case so that the German Government, although not accepting the theory of collective responsibility which I also do not accept, they agreed that it is right that recompense be made to all survivors that could be found, number one, and that where the survivors couldn't be found, the equivalent amount of money for a person killed would be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, which did help in the reconstitution or the getting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on its feet to a greater extent.</sentence><sentence id="1198">Well, that was the, I think, the fourth case.</sentence><sentence id="1199">The fifth case was the first of three industrialist cases.</sentence><sentence id="1200">The first one was against Friedrich Flick, and involved a relatively small number of defendants about eight or so, including the Papa Flick himself.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And they were tried on slave labor using large numbers of slave labors, using <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates, and going into <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span> as <span class="BUILDING">Flick Enterprises</span> and...and profiting from using the property of occupied people against the laws of war.</sentence><sentence id="1202">They got relatively short sentences.</sentence><sentence id="1203">I forget just what they were.</sentence><sentence id="1204">The sixth case is I.G. Farben where, the case of I.G.Farben industry, where I was chief of the trial team.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And we indicted a total of 23 leaders of the Farben concern.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Now by this time I should say the gentle notion was developing that the...lot of these industrialists and so on were very capable people and should be drawn into the industry that was being reconstituted in the <span class="REGION">western zone</span> as well as in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, <span class="REGION">French zone</span>, and so there's a tendency to encourage us to hurry up with the trials number one, and number two later on, there was a which I can cover at another time, there was Correction of Interviewee: Mr. Sprecher states that there were in fact two women tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1207">He is referring in this instance to Frau Herta Oberheuser.</sentence><sentence id="1208">5 tremendous pressure about reducing the sentences of some of these people.</sentence><sentence id="1209">They were convicted.</sentence><sentence id="1210">Now General Taylor would have none of this reducing sentences and he was backed up by General Clay.</sentence><sentence id="1211">So there was none of the reduction of sentences during the four years that I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1212">Well, to go on from the I.G.
