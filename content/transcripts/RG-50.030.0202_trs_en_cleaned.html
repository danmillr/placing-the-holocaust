<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Well, my parents, uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Their names first.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My parents, Leo Sauvage and uh Barbara Sauvage--whose maiden name is [Sucholosky (ph)]--were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell.</sentence><sentence id="16">My mother being a Polish Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>; my father being a French Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lorraine</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">And uh they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> at the fall of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>--it's [in the] south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>--and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the fall of 1943.</sentence><sentence id="18">My mother being pregnant at the time with me, and uh that is where I had the good fortune to be born.</sentence><sentence id="21">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 2</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Uh in their case they uh heard about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> from a friend, who suggested it to my father.</sentence><sentence id="35">My father had a particularly uh hard task, because not only did he have to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would be safe--my mother being particularly vulnerable as a foreign Jew.</sentence><sentence id="36">And, of course, the French were focusing uh much of their collaborative efforts in terms of turning over Jews on the foreign Jews.</sentence><sentence id="37">So my mother was particularly vulnerable.</sentence><sentence id="38">Uh, but in addition she had a problem pregnancy; and apparently the only chance she had of bringing the baby safely into the world was if she had as much peace and quiet and food as possible, which is a bit of a tall order for Nazi-occupied Europe.</sentence><sentence id="39">Uh, and this friend uh suggested <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">He...he knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span>; and my father went there and found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to rent, and uh went back to uh get my mother.</sentence><sentence id="41">And they came on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam engine train</span> that uh brought many Jews there, as we know.</sentence><sentence id="42">And uh...uh it was uh singularly fortunate, because I'll uh...I'll also mention that uh the doctor who took care of my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> was exactly for me the right doctor in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">Not only did he happen to be a whiz of a doctor who had trained under Albert Schweitzer in <span class="REGION">Africa</span>, dealing with all sorts of problems and apparently had a reputation as a bit of a medical genius, but in addition he was a a committed Christian--one of the first uh of the <span class="REGION">area</span> to be committed to non-violent resis...resistance against the Nazis--and had a special stake in my mother's situation and this baby that she wanted to bring into the world.</sentence><sentence id="44">I don't think that uh she would have gotten better medical attention if I had been born in the most modern <span class="BUILDING">American facility</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="47"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 3</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: So you were, or your mother was, brought to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="65">Where...where...the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that your parents rented, uh from whom did they rent it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: They rented it from a peasant couple in a uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> which is a part of <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> called <span class="BUILDING">La Fayolle</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="67">| Uh, I was known as the baby that used to wake up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> early in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="68">Uh, they uh...uh, well as I mentioned in my film, "Weapons of the Spirit," I...I...my parents didn't remain in touch, actually, with the farmers who rented that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">But I tracked them down.</sentence><sentence id="70">And the widow of the farmer who did rent the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is in my film.</sentence><sentence id="71">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="79">Where...where did your parents go after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: They went to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> for a year--which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>--where my father was a journalist.</sentence><sentence id="83">My father was already a journalist.</sentence><sentence id="84">He had been a journalist before the war.</sentence><sentence id="85">And then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Let's stay a minute [in] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> for that year.</sentence><sentence id="91">Uh, they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, for how long?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: They were there from the fall of 1943 "til the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="95">I don't know exactly when they leave, come to think of it... when they left, come to think of it.</sentence><sentence id="96">But it...I think it was around uh August of "44.</sentence><sentence id="97">Something like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: You talk, obviously, a lot about this in your film.</sentence><sentence id="103">Uh, but for the purposes of this interview, would you tell me more about the people with whom your parents came in contact, as they</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="109"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 4 told it to you?</sentence><sentence id="110">You were, of course, an infant.</sentence><sentence id="111">And did they know your parents were Jewish, and what that meant?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: (Pause) I've got to go about it... It's complicated, because there...there are presuppositions in the question that I have to actually address.</sentence><sentence id="113">That's the uh... I was not raised with stories about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, I was uh not raised with stories about the war, with stories about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="115">I was raised by parents who wanted to put all that behind them.</sentence><sentence id="116">So, much of what I've come to know about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>--although I've since spoken quite a bit about my parents, and I've gotten certainly information that is relevant.</sentence><sentence id="117">Uh, but it's not uh...a lot of my information is really information that I got as an adult, uh talking to people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="125">Then we'll do this, as it were, at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="128">And let's talk about uh... And we'll talk about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>, as such, at the end.</sentence><sentence id="129">Uh tell me where your parents went.</sentence><sentence id="130">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, you said.</sentence><sentence id="131">Uh, what did they do there and for how long were they there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: Well, they were there "til uh after the war.</sentence><sentence id="133">They were "til 1948, when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">Uh, my father, among other things, edited a uh intellectual weekly called "[La Rue (ph)]," which was uh quite prominent, had very prestigious uh writers--uh, including uh Sartre, Camus, and Raymond [Quenot (ph)]--and people like that contributed articles to it.</sentence><sentence id="135">But uh it was a very difficult time to launch a...a publication and there were all sorts of restrictions, including paper restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="136">And uh ultimately it had to fold after about ten or twelve issues.</sentence><sentence id="137">And uh my father uh had to find work; and ultimately he decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where he shortly thereafter became the correspondent of</sentence><sentence id="139"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 5 Le Figaro--a French daily--which he was for twenty-five years.</sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, [he was] also writing a number of books and also uh contributing to a number of other publications.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, uh by the time you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or were about to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, you would be four years--or close to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Do you remember anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Oh, I think I have a few uh memories that must go back to that time.</sentence><sentence id="159">But I'm really stunned by how much difficulty I have remembering much of my childhood; and I think that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised with memory being uh bad.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh, I was discouraged from...from remembering.</sentence><sentence id="161">I was discouraged from asking questions.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I think that's tampered with my ability to remember.</sentence><sentence id="163">And maybe that's what's given me a...a compelling need to...to document precisely, because I don't trust memory.</sentence><sentence id="164">Or maybe even to tell stories such as I do.</sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, so I remember uh startling little.</sentence><sentence id="166">In fact, the most startling thing I...I've thought about sometimes is that uh--particularly I have a two and a half year old daughter now--and...and is that I realize I was four when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I cannot until then... Obviously, I did not speak English.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I cannot remember ever... cannot remember the experience of having been in a <span class="REGION">foreign land</span> and not speaking the language.</sentence><sentence id="168">I have absolutely no recollection of it.</sentence><sentence id="169">And that, to me--and...and I can't imagine that that wasn't a traumatic experience, and I cannot connect with it.</sentence><sentence id="170">I cannot remember it.</sentence><sentence id="171">And I realize that four is already not, you know, it's not a baby anymore.</sentence><sentence id="172">So uh I...1 do view myself as a...as a product of a uh...of a traumatized childhood.</sentence><sentence id="175"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 6</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Well, let's talk about that, and talk more about that.</sentence><sentence id="196">Uh, when you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, uh what do you remember about those yearly, early years and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Very little.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Opposed to what you were told?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Very little.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Very little?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Very little, very little.</sentence><sentence id="208">Uh, as I get older I remember more, of course.</sentence><sentence id="209">But uh I...uh I think that the fact that uh my parents withheld from me vital information as to my identity-- as to who they were, as to why we were there, as to uh why they were who they were--uh really uh confused all my...all normal relationships with the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Who did you believe your parents were?</sentence><sentence id="214">How did... They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">You were with them.</sentence><sentence id="216">You had no memory of before.</sentence><sentence id="217">Did you believe you were Americans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="224">I knew that uh... No.</sentence><sentence id="225">In fact, I was raised very French.</sentence><sentence id="226">Uh, the uh...1...1 now believe that part of the reason I was raised so French was that it was a way of obliterating the Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">French school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">We spoke French at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; although I shouldn't</sentence><sentence id="230">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 7 overstate that, because there was also my...my mother.</sentence><sentence id="231">Even though she was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had a great love of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">By the way, she spoke French uh impeccably; and that had something to do with her survival during the war, too.</sentence><sentence id="233">She was able successfully to impersonate a Frenchwoman.</sentence><sentence id="234">I have uh come from a family with great linguistic skills.</sentence><sentence id="235">Uh, my sister later became an actress in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span>, uh playing Mexicans on the screen, you know.</sentence><sentence id="236">And as anyone who knows about acting knows, there's nothing more difficult than that.</sentence><sentence id="237">So it's...it's like, it's funny how you see these things follow through.</sentence><sentence id="238">Uh no, but we...I didn't...I knew we weren't Americans.</sentence><sentence id="239">I knew that we were...we were uh... In fact, interestingly, uh although I wasn't uh...I didn't know I was Jewish, we...I always knew we were different.</sentence><sentence id="240">We were foreign.</sentence><sentence id="241">It's almost a way in which my parents prepared me to...to then absorb the truth.</sentence><sentence id="242">If they had been people who completely assimilated, I certainly would have been a different person.</sentence><sentence id="243">They never did.</sentence><sentence id="244">Uh, just by remaining French, by remaining different, by not even being immigrants...my parents, I...they never really identified them[selves] as immigrants.</sentence><sentence id="245">I always had the feeling in the back of my mind that one day we would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">My father was a correspondent.</sentence><sentence id="247">You know, that this was not necessarily, you know, the...the final move.</sentence><sentence id="248">I never viewed them as like part of the, you know, immigrant flow into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">Uh, very strange.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: What about <span class="BUILDING">religion</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Uh, no religion.</sentence><sentence id="282">Uh I remember we...uh I was what might be called a "nothing."</sentence><sentence id="283">In other words, when I'd ask my parents, "What...what are we?,"</sentence><sentence id="284">they'd say, "We're nothing."</sentence><sentence id="285">And then they would move on; try to, you know, dismiss...dismiss the question.</sentence><sentence id="286">Uh, not long ago my sister mentioned, by the way, that she was not the only "nothing" in her class.</sentence><sentence id="287">Uh, you know, there...there are people who...who find themselves in... in that situation.</sentence><sentence id="288">Uh, but no.</sentence><sentence id="291"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 8 We were not...we were not Christians.</sentence><sentence id="292">I never assumed that, although it was confusing.</sentence><sentence id="293">I guess I assumed that uh... (Pause) I guess I must have assumed that we were uh, you know, originally Christian; but my father was violently anti-religious, as was my mother, in fact.</sentence><sentence id="294">And uh that meant nothing.</sentence><sentence id="295">I mean, there was nothing Christian about us.</sentence><sentence id="296">Uh we were nothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: How did it feel to be a nothing, to be of no religion and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Well, at the time uh I thought that was fine; or I...I thought ...I thought that was fine.</sentence><sentence id="317">Uh, I've come to feel very differently about that.</sentence><sentence id="318">But that's uh...I uh, you know, people often uh ask me--since I've mentioned the fact that I only learned I was Jewish when I was eighteen-- uh, "How did it...2" And what happened is that my parents sat me down and told me.</sentence><sentence id="319">I was about to go off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to study, and uh was going to be staying with a cousin of mine, uh who happens to be a survivor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">To compound the irony, a rather prominent gentlemen at that, Samuel [Pisar (ph)].</sentence><sentence id="321">And uh people will sometimes say, "Well, was it a real shock?"</sentence><sentence id="322">You know, "How did you react?"</sentence><sentence id="323">And L..they're surprised that it --I don't even remember exactly how I reacted.</sentence><sentence id="324">And basically the information never really got through to me, but the facts got through to me.</sentence><sentence id="325">But when you are raised with taboos, the taboos are so internalized that you don't fully absorb the information even when it is given to you.</sentence><sentence id="326">You...your...your filtering mechanisms keep working.</sentence><sentence id="327">Not only was I in the course of...of maintaining this...this lie about who we were, part of what that entailed is that I was completely cut off from almost all of my family.</sentence><sentence id="328">Uh, it was a great...except for a few members who joined in this conspiracy of not, of keeping the secret from the children.</sentence><sentence id="329">Uh, but uh it's still stunning to me to realize that my mother had aunts and uncles in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> whom I never knew, because they couldn't be counted on to maintain the secret of our</sentence><sentence id="331"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 9 being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="332">And now as I reconnect with those family members, I still...there's a part of me that finds it very difficult to absorb their identities and their names.</sentence><sentence id="333">It's like I...I'm...I still feel this is information I'm not supposed to have, and I have to fight to to have it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: When did you start... Let's keep going with this.</sentence><sentence id="355">When... when you went uh to your...your relative uh Samuel [Pisar (ph)], what was that like?</sentence><sentence id="356">Did the information become a little more internalized for you?</sentence><sentence id="357">What happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: No, it really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="363">It really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="364">It took a long time.</sentence><sentence id="365">And uh I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ten years, and I had no interest in...in any of this.</sentence><sentence id="366">Uh..-uh Sam at the time was uh uh...(pause) like many survivors, uh concerned with building his life; and he's an ambitious man.</sentence><sentence id="367">And focusing on...on that, uh although he would he would tell me stories.</sentence><sentence id="368">I think the...the main effect of that was he...he...he... Although he doesn't really remember it, uh he...he did tell me stories about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and about his experiences.</sentence><sentence id="369">And uh they had a profound effect on me.</sentence><sentence id="370">Uh but I still didn't really...1 couldn't even...I'm not sure I could define what it was.</sentence><sentence id="371">L...I still...No, I didn't uh...uh I had no Jewish identity when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">None.</sentence><sentence id="373">Uh, and no Jewish involvements.</sentence><sentence id="374">And uh...uh L...that really only started... The key influence in my life, in that respect, was my wife--whom I married uh not long after | moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> in 1971-- who's a uh Los Angeles native, uh uh very Jewish if one can speak in those terms, and very comfortable being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="375">And uh who worked on me for years and years and years.</sentence><sentence id="376">And uh...and then the most decisive influence of all was ultimately having children and realizing that I wanted them to have a very secure and comfortable sense of identity.</sentence><sentence id="377">And uh we uh...my wife wanted to send our son to a <span class="BUILDING">Reform day school</span>, which is where he goes now and where he thrives.</sentence><sentence id="378">And uh that has had an influence on me as well.</sentence><sentence id="381"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 10</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: As you began to discover your own identity and who you were, did you discuss this with your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: Yes, we...we had uh a number of discussions uh over the years.</sentence><sentence id="407">Uh, this was a very difficult subject for my father.</sentence><sentence id="408">My father died in uh October of 1988, not long before my film on Le Chambon--"Weapons of the Spirit"--was released.</sentence><sentence id="409">Although he did see it uh before he died, and the whole process that I was involved in was a very difficult one for him and a very scary one for him.</sentence><sentence id="410">Uh, after all, he had built his whole public persona on not being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="411">And uh...and as a journalist this was, you know, sort of a compounded irony.</sentence><sentence id="412">Not only was he a journalist, he was a good journalist; and he was also a crusader for truth and had been all his life.</sentence><sentence id="413">Uh, with this one big lie in his life.</sentence><sentence id="414">And here he had bred, as these things sometimes happen; this increasingly public Jew - not only a Jew, but somebody who was even insistent on being quite public about it.</sentence><sentence id="415">And uh I'll never forget one day uh in the early "80's, uh and I had this French film director who was visiting in L[os] A[ngeles] and we had dinner or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="416">And I talked about myself, and just coincidentally he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> shortly thereafter and he met my father.</sentence><sentence id="417">And uh in a phone conversation the following Sunday, my father said, "Why did you say that I..."--that my father--"was Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="418">I thought, "What...what was he talking about?"</sentence><sentence id="419">And I said, "I... didn't talk about...I don't even remember talking about you."</sentence><sentence id="420">And then he said, "Well, I met this director.</sentence><sentence id="421">And he mentioned...".</sentence><sentence id="422">And then I realized I had talked about myself; but talking about myself exposed my father.</sentence><sentence id="423">And I'll never forget that conversation.</sentence><sentence id="424">This was my...my dilemma, and it was in fact my dilemma in making the film - to preserve their privacy, their right to have some control over how they led their lives, which I basically believe was my obligation.</sentence><sentence id="425">At</sentence><sentence id="427">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 11 the same time, not to allow that to cripple my own ability to lead my own life and uh pass a healthy heritage on to my children.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: The question of my Jewish identity is such an...my Jewish identity is such an evolving one that it really changes; not only from year to year, but probably from month to month.</sentence><sentence id="661">And I have no idea what exactly that identity will be uh five years from now.</sentence><sentence id="662">Whether it will be a</sentence><sentence id="664">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 16 very pronounced one, or whether I will decide enough of this and this really doesn't matter to me that much.</sentence><sentence id="665">L...[ really don't...I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="666">I know that uh I felt a need to have an identity, that the only identity that it made sense for me to have was the identity of my ancestors.</sentence><sentence id="667">Uh, and that I have indeed become increasingly comfortable with it, that I realize that a lot of who I am is indeed uh wrapped up in...in Judaism and uh its influences on my family.</sentence><sentence id="668">You know, the influence...the influences exist whether they're identified or not.</sentence><sentence id="669">The fact that my parents uh never acknowledged being Jewish doesn't mean they weren't, in very fundamental ways, very Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="670">Uh, and uh and that influence was probably there.</sentence><sentence id="671">Uh, but uh... (Pause) You know, it's interesting how these things work.</sentence><sentence id="672">I think the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> made me more Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="673">They... First of all, I came to believe that at bottom, when you've cut through all the specifics of why they did what they did or all the conjecture--one can do all the factors that come into this--uh at bottom everything flowed from their own inescapable sense of their own identity.</sentence><sentence id="674">Their own sense of comfort at being who they were, at having no questions about who they were.</sentence><sentence id="675">And everything flowed, almost inescapably, incredibly naturally and very spontaneously, from that.</sentence><sentence id="676">That sense of identity.</sentence><sentence id="677">And if one derived strength from that, that rootedness, uh well then I had to try to aspire-- particularly as a parent, and wanting to be able to raise strong children--had to aspire to a similar rootedness and had to find my roots.</sentence><sentence id="678">And my roots were in being a Jew, so that was the only way to go.</sentence><sentence id="679">In addition, when I was making "Weapons of the Spirit," I realized that the way in which the film would be most effective would be if it was a Jewish film in praise of a group of Christians.</sentence><sentence id="680">It couldn't be a...a neutered film...wouldn't go anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="681">And that forced me to ...to absorb and understand as much as I could, to...to really be as Jewish as I could be in the making of that film.</sentence><sentence id="682">But that it's...it had to mirror, in a way, the...the reunion that took place in <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> between Jews and Christians, that it had to emb...embody it.</sentence><sentence id="683">As best as I could, as ignorant as I am still about so much of Judaism, it had to be uh Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="686">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 17 And I'm very touched, by the way, when uh orthodox Jews are responsive to the film, as indeed the few who have spoken to me have been.</sentence><sentence id="687">Uh, that means a lot to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: How do your parents react to your being Jewish, openly and publicly Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: My father was very uncomfortable with it.</sentence><sentence id="721">My mother, particularly since my father passed away, has uh really jettisoned a lot of the past taboos.</sentence><sentence id="722">In fact, she's probably made changes faster than I've been able to accept her changes.</sentence><sentence id="723">Uh, that often happens that way.</sentence><sentence id="724">Uh, I'm almost locked into my image of her; and she probably is far readier to change than than I am ready to accept her changes.</sentence><sentence id="725">So she really, I I must say, now is...is...seems to be quite comfortable with all of this uh...and uh loves the film.</sentence><sentence id="726">Has a tape of it which she looks at periodically, and uh very, very supportive and uh uh uh...and uh apparently quite comfortable with all of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

(Pause) If I may, I'm...I'm tempted to...to interject real quickly that we really live in a sexist society, uh one form of which is to discount often the...the female influence.</sentence><sentence id="782">You know, when it comes to rescue in particular, when it comes to rescuers, uh I'm convinced that women played a far more important role than men.</sentence><sentence id="783">It was often the woman who would be literally at the <span class="DLF">door</span> if somebody knocked on it.</sentence><sentence id="784">It was in...often into it in the <span class="BUILDING">mother's home</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="785">When the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> is told, you know, one tends to focus--when...when it's talking about leadership-- on Pastor Trocme, who was an extraordinary figure whom I...L..1 admire inordinately.</sentence><sentence id="786">A brilliant, brilliant man.</sentence><sentence id="787">Uh, but really, that...that combination of Pastor Trocme and Magda</sentence><sentence id="789">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 19 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trocme</span> was an extraordinary combination.</sentence><sentence id="790">She is the most direct, uh efficient, uh focused person I have ever known.</sentence><sentence id="791">Uh, she uh...

You know, Trocme--Pastor Trocme--was a...a thinker.</sentence><sentence id="795">Uh, some of that thinking ended up producing tremendous results; and he would...he did things.</sentence><sentence id="796">But uh Magda Trocme is truly a...a doer.</sentence><sentence id="797">You know, "What do you need now?</sentence><sentence id="798">What has to be done now?"</sentence><sentence id="799">You know, "How are you going to solve that problem?"</sentence><sentence id="800">It...it....

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1161">Q: What would you like to add for the purposes of this film we have done ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1163">A: Well, I'd like to say something about righteous Christians, such as the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, to which I am increasingly devoting part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And perhaps particularly this: as we come to attach more importance to them, and we are doing that, we must not fall into a trap.</sentence><sentence id="1165">The old trap used to be to dismiss them, to ignore them, to consider that all this was so uh...they were so few in number that they're not important.</sentence><sentence id="1166">Because they were few in number.</sentence><sentence id="1167">And, of course, they were few in number.</sentence><sentence id="1168">But that's precisely what makes them important.</sentence><sentence id="1169">Uh, and that somehow focusing on them will whitewash that period, that somehow it will make...give the world an excuse to feel better about itself.</sentence><sentence id="1170">Well, that's not the way it works.</sentence><sentence id="1171">On the contrary, they make us accountable.</sentence><sentence id="1172">They prove that it was possible to care.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And that is what is necessary.</sentence><sentence id="1174">If we hand on only a memory of...of...of bitterness and hopelessness, then the world is off the hook.</sentence><sentence id="1175">If the world ends up thinking that it is not possible to combat evil, that it is not possible to stand up, then...then it's off the hook.</sentence><sentence id="1176">Then it's not possible to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1177">So that that...all those things we will quickly come to understand.</sentence><sentence id="1178">But the...the...the <span class="DLF">trap</span> is that we not, in focusing on them, start idealizing them.</sentence><sentence id="1179">That we not put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pedestals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1180">That we not make heros of them.</sentence><sentence id="1181">Of course, they appear to us unusual because they weren't many and there's something inescapably moving about them.</sentence><sentence id="1182">But it is crucial that we take their word for it, that what they did came naturally to them.</sentence><sentence id="1183">It was normal.</sentence><sentence id="1184">It was no big deal.</sentence><sentence id="1185">That these people are no different from us.</sentence><sentence id="1186">That what they did is...we are capable of doing.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Uh, that uh they acted out of emotions and attitudes that were not heroic, larger than life uh...you know, emotions;</sentence><sentence id="1189">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*202 27 but just very small normal emotions.</sentence><sentence id="1190">Uh, there were...there were hero-types also during the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1191">There were people like Raoul Wallenberg or Andre Trocme.</sentence><sentence id="1192">These were people who had a...a compelling need to make their mark, to...to.... These were heros.</sentence><sentence id="1193">Most rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust were not that sort.</sentence><sentence id="1194">They were very ordinary people, who simply responded appropriately to the challenge that they faced.</sentence><sentence id="1195">And they are the most relevant to us.</sentence><sentence id="1196">Very few of us are going to be Raoul Wallenbergs.</sentence><sentence id="1197">All of us, every day, are faced with choices that involve recognizing that there is a need to help, uh a need not to turn away, a need to realize that we are responsible for something that is going on around us.</sentence><sentence id="1198">That we can influence positively.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And we need to know--in a way, in the most selfish...for the most selfish reasons--that responding to that need will make us feel good, will make us feel uh peaceful, happy, uh will prolong our lives.</sentence><sentence id="1200">Uh to care about other people is fundamentally to care about yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And that is part of what I hope uh people will derive from contact with...through <span class="BUILDING">museums</span>, through books, through films, will derive from learning about the righteous gentiles of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And the righteous Jews of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1203">Because they existed, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1259">A: I think it is no coincidence that somebody who was raised to forget ended up making a documentary record of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1260">I think that uh maybe people who</sentence><sentence id="1262"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 28 are raised with stories all their lives sometimes take them for granted.</sentence><sentence id="1263">Uh, people who trust their memory often have maybe less of a need to document.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Because I have such a precarious memory, because it's such a challenge for me to...to...to remember things, I only feel secure if it's in some way recorded.</sentence><sentence id="1265">To me, it only exists when it's recorded.</sentence><sentence id="1266">And uh I think that may have been a big part of this compulsive need to document uh the story of Le Chambon and--forgive me for saying so, but--to really document it as accurately as I possibly could.</sentence><sentence id="1267">You cannot footnote a film, but I love history.</sentence><sentence id="1268">Uh, I love academic research. [...</sentence><sentence id="1269">1 really wanted this to be as uh accurate as it possibly could be; bearing in mind that any film has to have a dramatic flow, even a documentary.</sentence><sentence id="1270">So, you know, you...you tell; but at the same time--and that was part of the reason that it took so long and was such a challenge, in terms of putting it together--to both respect the history, respect all the details, have every detail right, and yet not have it be boring.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Which was my primary obligation as a filmmaker.</sentence><sentence id="1272">It had to...the film had to work.</sentence><sentence id="1273">I think that uh my traumatized upbringing probably had a lot to do with my need to tell the story, and probably had a lot to do...certainly had a lot to do with the effect that the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> had on me.</sentence><sentence id="1274">Uh, you know, the amazing thing to me, as I've come to reflect on this a little bit, about the influence of the story of Le Chambon on my life is that it really uh...it happened twice.</sentence><sentence id="1275">It happened at my birth; but it happened when I was an adult and I came back there and met these people again, and was so heavily influenced by them that it really changed my life.</sentence><sentence id="1276">And I really feel that they rescued me twice.</sentence><sentence id="1277">And perhaps it is that second form of rescue-- the rescue of me as a lost, rootless, depressed adult--that gives "Weapons of the Spirit" something of a universal message.</sentence><sentence id="1278">Because I do believe that many of us, even though my case may have been exteme, that many of us do have a need for positive stories to hold on to.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Legitimate, real realistic sources of hope.</sentence><sentence id="1280">And that I had that need.</sentence><sentence id="1281">And... and the film--</sentence><sentence id="1283"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*202 29 the making of the film and the film itself--responded to that need.</sentence><sentence id="1284">And maybe that it's how to give the story whatever universal ramifications it may have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
