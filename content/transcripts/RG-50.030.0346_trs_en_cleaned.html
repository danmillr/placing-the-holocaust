<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: What kind of <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: If somebody is familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Silk Shop</span>, which used to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, it was very similar.</sentence><sentence id="201">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wools</span>, and lace, and buttons, and gloves, and hats, and -- I mean, all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="202">And it was in existence for a very long time, until the Germans took the keys away.</sentence><sentence id="203">And so my father's family was more religious than my mother's family.</sentence><sentence id="204">But we celebrated all the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="205">And our Passover was just fantastic.</sentence><sentence id="206">It was so beautiful and -- it was so beautiful, I remember that we -- I used fall asleep finally, because it lasted so long.</sentence><sentence id="207">But all the -- it was just beautiful.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism or you just weren't around it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Oh, we felt it.</sentence><sentence id="260">Somehow we did feel it.</sentence><sentence id="261">We knew that it exist.</sentence><sentence id="262">We felt it much more before -- after Hitler came into power and after the death of Marshall Pilsudski.</sentence><sentence id="263">That really felt it and I remember one program.</sentence><sentence id="264">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> all the father, I and Lolick (ph) and when we came back my mom was petrified, terrified standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span> because she had a feeling which I will always remember because she knew there is a program and -- but we were able to somehow safely reach our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">And there was some times such a underlying fear of certain things which I as a child could sense and it had much to do with anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="266">That .... did that answer your question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes, and it, your question actually right now is how it was before the war?</sentence><sentence id="278">See, that</sentence><sentence id="280">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 6 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was going to was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and I started the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from the first grade and then I was maybe fortunate because I gained one year to graduate and they -- I had my papers graduation papers.</sentence><sentence id="281">I thought they were very important.</sentence><sentence id="282">Dave, my husband, saw them and when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I thought it would be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="283">I put it in my stocking.</sentence><sentence id="284">But of course, it wasn't helpful.</sentence><sentence id="285">I could get a copy, I think, if I would write to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, but it's not -- not really important right now.</sentence><sentence id="286">So it was -- it was actually a good life.</sentence><sentence id="287">It was a Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="288">We also had very high morals and ethics.</sentence><sentence id="289">And I remember that when the Germans came and we had to wear the yellow star I was, nothing to it as I was concerned, but I had a friend, Genya Finkelstein (ph), who was from a little bit more assimilated <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she didn't want to go out I said, "Genya, they're doing it to us.</sentence><sentence id="290">They are the perpetrators.</sentence><sentence id="291">Let them be ashamed.</sentence><sentence id="292">Why should we be ashamed to wear the star?"</sentence><sentence id="293">And it had something to do with the upbringing I received in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we knew much about charity.</sentence><sentence id="294">My father used to always to say "It's not enough to give.</sentence><sentence id="295">It's important how you give."</sentence><sentence id="296">I know when there were some relatives not close relatives who needed help.</sentence><sentence id="297">There was always help ready for them and every Friday night my father was bringing from the <span class="BUILDING">House Of Prayers</span> a guest which is called the orrach, and he was sitting with us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and when we finished the meal he was given a bag of food to take with him and nobody asked him any questions.</sentence><sentence id="298">It was a charitable atmosphere in our family.</sentence><sentence id="299">For instance, my grandmother one time somebody stole silver spoons and her daughter says, "Don't let him in anymore."</sentence><sentence id="300">She says, "Look, if he wouldn't have needed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">spoons</span>, he wouldn't have taken them."</sentence><sentence id="301">So considering the high ethics and high morals it was inconceivable for us to think that such atrocities which followed later on are possible that we had to prepare ourselves, but there was no way to prepare ourselves anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="304"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*346 7</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="336">Q: One more question about before the war.</sentence><sentence id="337">Were you involved in any political or Zionist organizations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: I knew of their existence.</sentence><sentence id="341">I knew of their existence.</sentence><sentence id="342">However, in -- in retrospect I know that it was -- actually the right thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="343">Because if you have an idea, no matter how impossible it seems at the certain time what should actually follow it?</sentence><sentence id="344">Because the first there is an idea always and there are deeds following it.</sentence><sentence id="345">But because of the background and because of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was not involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="346">I remember a certain time somebody wanted to -- to -- me to join, but I didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: What do you remember about the day when the Germans came in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: Yeah, it was a very, very frightening thing.</sentence><sentence id="357">They put up some --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: What was the, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="361">What was the date, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: It was in 1939 and it must have been already in September.</sentence><sentence id="365">And some gallows were put on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and some Jewish men were hung and they were very much interested that as many as possible people would see it.</sentence><sentence id="366">When they entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> they somehow wanted to harass and abuse the Jewish men, so there were, let's say, a knock in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they wanted my father.</sentence><sentence id="367">People who were taken to so called work were not taken actually to</sentence><sentence id="369"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*346 8 actual work.</sentence><sentence id="370">Some people were, for instance, bringing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> up the set <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and the others were suppose to take it down and so on.</sentence><sentence id="371">It was just shear harassment.</sentence><sentence id="372">Shear torment.</sentence><sentence id="373">Shear like they wanted to demoralize us and what was happening was my father was still going to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I was afraid that he'll be picked up and harassed, so I was going with him and he called me his angel.</sentence><sentence id="374">I had long brown hair and somehow I was very often able to talk the German out of letting him go.</sentence><sentence id="375">I remember that one time we -- they brought us into a <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and they left.</sentence><sentence id="376">And -- but it was a very frightening time because it was a very unsure time because -- and what was so tragic about it the Germans actually could not recognize who is a Jew and who is not, but there were Polish children standing on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and pointing out to the Germans who is Jewish and considering that they were just having been occupied by the Germans and why did they do it?</sentence><sentence id="377">You know, very often I'm thinking about it.</sentence><sentence id="378">Where does all this, I mean, it's -- it's based on -- on the teaching unfortunately of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> which I hope is being changed.</sentence><sentence id="379">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it will take a very, very long time until it would be changed.</sentence><sentence id="380">I heard somebody saying that he got this feeling of a stygmatism with the milk of his mother.</sentence><sentence id="381">Because -- and as I understand, that the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, the -- anyhow the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> since Pope the 23rd, is realizing that the roots, a lot of the roots of this tragedy actually started with the people of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">Because it can teach hatred and there have been changes in their liturgy and their changes are -- are going on.</sentence><sentence id="383">I'm sure there are many, many Christians of very good heart and I'm glad that there is from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vatican</span> some directions now to change the liturgy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="407">We were talking about how the Polish people would -- would turn you in.</sentence><sentence id="408">What</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="415">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 9 else was happening on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: It was especially -- for instance, it was so dangerous that my parents decided to send Lolick, my brother, to a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where his closest friends were living.</sentence><sentence id="417">In the hope that he would be spared, but he came back after awhile because things were just as bad there.</sentence><sentence id="418">There was also much more difficult to get fuel.</sentence><sentence id="419">Much more difficult to get food, so we were living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in order to save fuel.</sentence><sentence id="420">We could sometimes -- of course we couldn't get the amount of food which we needed, but we still could get some food.</sentence><sentence id="421">It was dangerous to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="422">It was dangerous to be in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they were just coming in and pulling you out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Were there any bombings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: The bombings were in the short period before the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="433">In fact, we went to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">We -- you know, there were <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> where people were keeping the food to keep it cold and we were hiding there because there were some raids.</sentence><sentence id="435">That was in the period, the short period, before the German army actually entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="460">Q: So, did you stay in most of the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: We must have stayed in, but they were also coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="463">I remember one time when they came and we hid my father in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, but it didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="464">We had to show them where he is and they pulled him out.</sentence><sentence id="465">And he wasn't -- he was very spiritual and he was very learned, but he wasn't a strong man, a very strong man physically.</sentence><sentence id="466">But he actually survived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="469"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*346 11</sentence></p></dialogue>

think about the time we were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="662"><span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> was the Kriminal Polizei.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="755">Now, the problems in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were hunger, lack of fuel.</sentence><sentence id="756">But the worse of the</sentence><sentence id="758"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*346 17 worse was, the constant, deportations.</sentence><sentence id="759">And you could never be sure that, what is not being deported.</sentence><sentence id="760">And -- but there was one deportation, in particular, which was done by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="761">The other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">deportations</span> -- when they hit somebody, of course, it was very tragic.</sentence><sentence id="762">So we really did not know for sure what was happening to us, and nobody thought that we were going to <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they would gas us in some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">In the beginning, they are telling us, they are taking people to work.</sentence><sentence id="764">And there was a small number of people who were deported from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the purpose of working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or in the <span class="REGION">territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">In fact, one of my cousin, who was pretty husky, came back one time from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working

class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="768">Very likely, yes.</sentence><sentence id="769">But it was torturous work.</sentence><sentence id="770">So we did not know.</sentence><sentence id="771">We actually had no inkling that a deportation means being taken to death, or gassed, or murdered.</sentence><sentence id="772">And this Germans were master of deceit.</sentence><sentence id="773">Before they -- the deportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="774">And I don't know who, in particular, it was.</sentence><sentence id="775">But it was people.</sentence><sentence id="776">And they were assuring us that we should take everything we possibly can with us, because we are going to a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="777">And I remember that my brother was working very hard to pack everything possible.</sentence><sentence id="778">They say, "Take pots and take pans, because you are going to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span>" -- and I was sick already at that time.</sentence><sentence id="779">So I was just watching them.</sentence><sentence id="780">But they were packing.</sentence><sentence id="781">Now, the deportation -- going back to the deportation.</sentence><sentence id="782">There were always deportations.</sentence><sentence id="783">There was a list made, which in view of what happened -- this was, I think, "42, September -- the alternative -- the other alternative was very -- was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="784">They just -- I am -- they just came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, they ordered a gehsperren, which means, you know, a curfew -- they ordered a curfew and they said that they would take all elderly people, they would take children, and take -- we are -- if anybody would hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they would be shot.</sentence><sentence id="785">What I did -- I knew -- my mother was actually in</sentence><sentence id="787"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*346 18 her 40s.</sentence><sentence id="788">But she already had gray hair.</sentence><sentence id="789">And I was very much afraid for her, that they would take her.</sentence><sentence id="790">I don't know how I did it.</sentence><sentence id="791">But I took her to the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which they already were searching and taking people away, and I hid her there.</sentence><sentence id="792">But I had to run back because there had to be a certain amount of people present in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> for them to do the selection.</sentence><sentence id="793">And then I went back and brought her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">Now, that was a terrifying time, because they were shooting anybody who, let's say, approached a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, or run to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that they didn't want to, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="795">They were all shooting.</sentence><sentence id="796">They were just shooting.</sentence><sentence id="797">They were taking some people who were younger.</sentence><sentence id="798">They did not really select only the older, the elderly, ones.</sentence><sentence id="799">It was one of the most traumatic, terrifying deportation.</sentence><sentence id="800">So there's no excuse for anything.</sentence><sentence id="801">However, maybe because none of my family was deported -- so I'll tell you in a few minutes about my brother.</sentence><sentence id="802">In comparison with the alternative, the alternative would have been -- I'm talking about the list -- the alternative would have been that they would enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and just shoot whomever they wanted and drag whomever, which was of course much more frightening to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="803">And we didn't know and no one knew that we are going, just like we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, which I am very surprised that the Poles or somebody from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> would not somehow give us, because they knew.</sentence><sentence id="804">They knew where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was, and they knew what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="805">Anyhow, one time, my brother was about to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="806">What happened -- my mother was at her sister's, and I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and that Sonderkommando came, and they looked for him that he was supposed to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="807">And he hid.</sentence><sentence id="808">But we had to, we had to, he had to come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding</span>, and they took him.</sentence><sentence id="809">And I had only one solution.</sentence><sentence id="810">See, he was very sick in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">He was sick with typhus.</sentence><sentence id="812">And he was -- that was a very terrible experience, because he was very sick and his eyes were not completely closed, only partial.</sentence><sentence id="813">And finally, it was so hard on me to look at it that I was sleeping at a neighbor's and, in the morning, I was going to the</sentence><sentence id="815">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 19 <span class="DLF">window</span> -- we had the shutters closed -- and looking through the shutters whether he is still there.</sentence><sentence id="816">And my mother, did everything possible -- we got some food for him -- she washed him, she bathed him.</sentence><sentence id="817">And a neighbor told us of a doctor who was a heart specialist, Doctor Yorkiche (ph).</sentence><sentence id="818">And Doctor Yorkiche found that his myocardium, which is a sac around the heart, is infected.</sentence><sentence id="819">And everybody suspected its typhus also.</sentence><sentence id="820">But if it would be -- if they would have taken him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- of contagious diseases -- you would have never come out.</sentence><sentence id="821">Nobody came out of there.</sentence><sentence id="822">And -- but -- so he was finally taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, a regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="823">And fortunately, this was not at the time.</sentence><sentence id="824">Because later on, the German took all the patients from all the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, including the <span class="BUILDING">children's hospital</span>, and deported them.</sentence><sentence id="825">But that was earlier.</sentence><sentence id="826">He reported that he was going to work.</sentence><sentence id="827">But I knew Doctor Yorkiche.</sentence><sentence id="828">And Doctor Yorkiche was supposed to be in the commission to select who is going and who is not -- no, I mean, -- so I ran to her, and I said, "Do you remember how sick he was?</sentence><sentence id="829">Do whatever you can do, and she must not have done it because they didn't take him."</sentence><sentence id="830">So we were together -- and maybe I should inject it now.</sentence><sentence id="831">When you philosophically think about life, it's true.</sentence><sentence id="832">They didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="833">I'm the only one who survived.</sentence><sentence id="834">But everyday -- I mean, the life is not forever anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="835">So that we were together and that we were together until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> has its great value.</sentence><sentence id="836">And when we talk about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I will mention to you that we had a day extra.</sentence><sentence id="837">But I think I should do it later.</sentence><sentence id="838">My father was also sick.</sentence><sentence id="839">But he also recovered.</sentence><sentence id="840">And he had a work, which was much too much for his physical strength.</sentence><sentence id="841">So -- but I was able to find him some other work.</sentence><sentence id="842">I felt always some responsibility for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="843">When my brother was</sentence><sentence id="845">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*346 20 sick, I prayed that if somebody has to go, let it be me, but not him.</sentence><sentence id="846">And I always tried to get something.</sentence><sentence id="847">I was able to get some soup, I was able to pick up some leaves, I was able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> of -- I mean, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were vegetables -- and get the potato, or get something.</sentence><sentence id="848">But finally, you know, there was a lot of starvation.</sentence><sentence id="849">And I, actually, was never used to -- wasn't a big eater.</sentence><sentence id="850">But I was the one who had swollen -- who had edema.</sentence><sentence id="851">And later on -- that was already "43.

cold -- there were times that it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1320">But I think that they even cleaned the <span class="DLF">streets</span> during the winter, maybe not for us, maybe for the
