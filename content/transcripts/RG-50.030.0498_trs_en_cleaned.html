direction.</sentence><sentence id="3695">And just sat there, you know, and looked.</sentence><sentence id="3696">So I told -- you know, everybody, they are here.</sentence><sentence id="3697">So the men got out of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which was him, his son, and my brother, my father, four of them jumped out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and we didn't know where they were going, but out.</sentence><sentence id="3698">And we quickly -- I put on a kerchief, you know, I made myself really look like -- all of us like farmers, we're all

was nothing but hay there, and [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="3716">So then, we could hardly wait for the men to see -- so here they come, God, all in one piece, you know, with like -- but we knew we had to leave that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3717">So what we did, outside that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we made room for our

id="3723">And we left there, and we went -- you know, inside the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> a long different direction.</sentence><sentence id="3724">And then -- trying to think, you know what happened first, it's hard to remember.</sentence><sentence id="3725">Went there, and we buried that, and then -- and then we went on.</sentence><sentence id="3726">Which was a big mistake, cause we got caught in the middle of shooting, the Germans -- and the French liberated us, the French and the Moroccans.</sentence><sentence id="3727">And they were shooting at each other, and we were in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="3728">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="3729">The French -- we finally saw a Frenchman, and we're so happy, and he says, go away, go away.</sentence><sentence id="3730">And we didn't know why he say -- tell us to go away.</sentence><sentence id="3731">You know, you're so stupid sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="3732">Anyway, all of a sudden we're just in the middle of all this fighting going on.</sentence><sentence id="3733">And my poor dad and mom wanted to protect us, so they each laid on us.</sentence><sentence id="3734">Dad laid on me, and Mom laid on my brother, so that things shouldn't hit us.</sentence><sentence id="3735">We laid there for hours.</sentence><sentence id="3736">And then finally, it's kind of stopped, so we kind of thought, let's go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and get our stuff and get out of -- out of here.</sentence><sentence id="3737">So when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, everything was -- they ripped the</sentence><sentence id="3739">1 pictures, whoever found.</sentence><sentence id="3740">See, they thought maybe we had money that we buried.</sentence><sentence id="3741">Mut -- somebody must have seen us do that, but they thought maybe it was money and when that wasn't money, they was mad, so they ripped things, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3742">And so
