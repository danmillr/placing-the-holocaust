id="678">The Russians got in the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">They are progressing beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="680">And this is really now that half after <span class="COUNTRY">Romania Romania</span> wanted to jump out of the war and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="681">So that was in 1990 in 1944, October.</sentence><sentence id="682">So we thought that maybe we _ we will be able to salvage ourselves in the meantime.</sentence><sentence id="683">The the they through the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span>, we knew that the SS left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, basically.</sentence><sentence id="684">There was special SS dealing with Jewish things.</sentence><sentence id="685">So we thought that's the end of the story.</sentence><sentence id="686">And then on the 15th, which there was next morning, we look out in the <span

truly</sentence></p><p><sentence id="698">so that was in in October.</sentence><sentence id="699">And then the all the women and the all the males were</sentence></p><p><sentence id="700">ordered to one of the one of the large <span class="BUILDING">assembly places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="701">And they then the march</sentence></p><p><sentence id="702">started.</sentence><sentence id="703">As you know, the fact being that there were no possibility already to deport from</sentence></p><p><sentence id="704">the from the <span

id="706"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">So it was after October, there was no way that the deportation could be.</sentence><sentence id="708">The</sentence></p><p><sentence id="709">the Budapest Jews deportation couldn't be done because the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are already fortunately</sentence></p><p><sentence id="710">not the Red Army that occupied them already.</sentence><sentence id="711">So that time I about two weeks later, a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="712">proclamation from the from the Arrow

id="722"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, but I don't know how much would that affect us, because I didn't know my</sentence></p><p><sentence id="723">wife at the time.</sentence><sentence id="724">She was only ten years old.</sentence><sentence id="725">So anyway, at I made it too complicated.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="726">They had Schutz

in.</sentence><sentence id="732">And I mean, you have half a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="733"><span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but nevertheless, you had some kind of protection.</sentence><sentence id="734">So my father was at the time in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="735">in the forced arm forced camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.162139"

taking them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="742">So I, being the head of the _ the family at that time, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="743">Sol I took off my yellow star, and I went out to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> that generally the transport is going through.</sentence><sentence id="744">I think it was about three or four days

let me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="750">So we, without any major incidents, were protected in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish
