<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: That was going to be -- that was going to be one of my questions, is how was that transition for -- for a young child?</sentence><sentence id="243">They -- they soak up languages like sponges.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: So, I could imagine --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: I was teaching my parents.</sentence><sentence id="251">My parents had been taking English lessons, you know, with -- with records and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="252">And they -- they died with an accent, okay?</sentence><sentence id="253">I picked it up immediately.</sentence><sentence id="254">And the principal said to me, you speak German?</sentence><sentence id="255">I -- well, I understand German, cause I didn't want to speak it any more.</sentence><sentence id="256">And apparently, there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me, the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="257">And I --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: And you were how old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: -- refused to talk to --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: I must have been about eight or nine at the time.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I said no, I won't talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="278">And I wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="279">I would not talk -- I wouldn't meet with them, I wouldn't talk to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: So tell me though, as an eight or nine year old child, to have such -- such a very strong, marked position, how had things been explained to you by your parents, of what was going on, and why you'd left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and -- and this war, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="285">Ti -- can you recall that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="289">I don't remember ever actually discussing it with them.</sentence><sentence id="290">It was just sort of a fact of life that you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">You didn't -- you -- you couldn't stay there any more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms, and the boots, and -- and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of there, the better.</sentence><sentence id="292">So, off we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and I became an English child fast.</sentence><sentence id="293">I --I was --as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I -- I picked it up, you know, very quickly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So, in other words, was it an English child saying to the principal that no, I don't want to talk to the German prisoners of war, because they're the enemy of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we've just survived the blitz, or was it a --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: No, I just said I don't want to talk to them.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: And that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: And that was the end of it, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="309">And I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="310">I never met them, and I --I wouldn't speak with them, so I-- I don't know why they wanted to talk to me in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Lalso find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: I find it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: It was -- I don't know, maybe -- I don't know, maybe they were being rehabilitated or something, I don't know, I really don't know, but it was kind of a strange episode.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: But other than that, did you wa -- did you feel comfortable in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders.</sentence><sentence id="323">We were the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="324">At that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was a little different, but out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="325">They didn't know what Jews were.</sentence><sentence id="326">We sort of had to explain, you know.</sentence><sentence id="327">There was a woman who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, once or twice -- I think once a week or twice a week, I don't remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can't read.</sentence><sentence id="328">And once in awhile, after things were not quite as bad, we -- we had some relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, so we would go to visit them in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="329">Meanwhile, my aunt, the aunt, my mother's sister, the one who married the German, she had also been</sentence><sentence id="331">2 interned in the Isle of Man.</sentence><sentence id="332">And she was released, and she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for -- until after the war, and eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> But we would go and visit her too, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on.</sentence><sentence id="333">That -- that was pretty bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: Do you remember war -- wartime sorts of episodes or experiences while in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, or was it blitz, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltenham</span> and -- and this, you know, inter -- non- interaction with -- with the -- the POWs, you know, that you were asked to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Were there more such things that -- that -- that are in your mind?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Well, I remember listening to Churchill on the radio.</sentence><sentence id="354">I mean, everybody listened to Churchill on the radio, and he made things, you know, he was very positive, and --and upbeat and everything.</sentence><sentence id="355">I remember the sound of the -- the bombs, you know, the -- those things that -- that made this noise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V2 rockets</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Yeah, and then they stopped, and then you knew they were gonna fall.</sentence><sentence id="362">And then when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and -- at night, we would come out in the morning and there would be rubble all over, because you know, the bomb had dropped not far away.</sentence><sentence id="363">But the -- the underground was very safe, and everybody went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">I loved it, because I--I have no siblings, and when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, you know, we'd go with our pillows and our blankets and</sentence><sentence id="366">ontectreferarneGaushriarg er hither btrmedortabnattfiexaliaton 3 everything, and there'd be kids to play with.</sentence><sentence id="367">It was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="368">On the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, you know, we -- we'd run around and have a great time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: What -- what kids do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: What kids do, and thank goodness they do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
