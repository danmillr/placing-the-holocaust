<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3703">A: Yeah, there were some -- for instance, there were some -- some Jewish families changed their house language, their family language from Yiddish to Russian, and Lithuanians resented that, you know, he -- he -- they give up Yiddish, why then don't -- they don't pick up Lithuanian?</sentence><sentence id="3704">And Yi-Yiddish didn't -- didn't bother anybody, Hebrew didn't bother anybody, but Russian, why Russian, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3705">But -- but -- but I heard myself, I mean, f-father and son Jewish speaking in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3706">So there were those who did that, you know, and w-went to Lithuanian language.</sentence><sentence id="3707">Even in this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> I saw a Jewish girl writing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> her d--her diary in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> because she -- she ju-just didn't know ji -- Yiddish that well.</sentence><sentence id="3708">So, there were -- it was -- it was a big community, it was varied situations, but generally, right or no -- or not, but in the people there was a sense of betrayal because they thought that the relations were good, and they didn't see the reason why the Jewish community is acting that way, or much of the community, in particular the younger generation.</sentence><sentence id="3709">The older generation, of course, didn't partici -- participate in -- in that, but as I said, they just -- they just were in -- behind the picture, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3710">Nobody cared much about the -- the</sentence><sentence id="3712">127 rabbis or something like that, how -- how they look at the things.</sentence><sentence id="3713">Now, I also write in my memoirs that, one interesting thing that one of our -- our family's friend was Dr.Bridges family, Dr. Bridges, Andrew Bridges was a doctor, you know, his specialty eyes, you know, and he had some Jewish friends, some Jewish also doctors.</sentence><sentence id="3714">And during the Soviet occupation, the first year of -- the first Soviet occupation, he-he was told by one of his friends, Jewish friends, that the Jewish community leaders from the independence period, were concerned about this reaction of the younger generation, and they called some of the active -- well, pro -- pro-communist, younger, active people and talked with them, and asked them not -- not to overdo things, that it is dangerous, that the Jewish community, living hundreds of times bet-between other nationalities, tried not to become hostile to the people they are living between.</sentence><sentence id="3715">Tried to be neutral, you know, and th-th-they e -- taking sides, they couldn't have survived, because they would also, you know, provoke a lot of hostility.</sentence><sentence id="3716">And they asked those younger generation Jews to tone down, to tone down.</sentence><sentence id="3717">And they said the younger -- the young people just lef-- la -- just laughed at them.</sentence><sentence id="3718">The old people they don't understand anything, and their rules, I mean, are ob- obsolete and -- and didn't want even to listen to them.</sentence><sentence id="3719">So apparently even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, there was some perception that somebody is 0-overdoing the things.</sentence><sentence id="3720">Now, was -- as I say, you know, those who were against this reaction, you know, they we -- they were -- they were i-in -- invisible, they tried to be-become</sentence><sentence id="3722">128 invisible.</sentence><sentence id="3723">Now you asking about the period from -- in early 1940s.</sentence><sentence id="3724">Really the breakthrough was the annexation earlier, in 1940, August, I think the third or fifth, about that time.</sentence><sentence id="3725">Right after the annexation, the thing changed.</sentence><sentence id="3726">Now the terror intensified consid -- considerably, and the resistance started getting organized.</sentence><sentence id="3727">So now, la --a lot of people, even in -- in -- in -- in -- in my class, like Grimkas(ph) and Ar-Arbuk(ph) were arrested from resistance.</sentence><sentence id="3728">But even the [indecipherable] resistance, the people who were prominent in the -- in the society generally, most of them were arrested, th-thousands now.</sentence><sentence id="3729">Now it became a mass thing.</sentence><sentence id="3730">Now there was nationa -- nationalization;
