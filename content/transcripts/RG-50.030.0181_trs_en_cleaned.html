<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Could you please tell us your name and where and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Henry G., G for George, Plitt.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> in 1918 and that, of course, was late in the year that year, just two weeks after the Armistice for World War I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where were you educated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> there, and one year at DeWitt Clinton High School, after which my family sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanton</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span>, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">It's spelled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">It's pronounced <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanton</span> and there I began my military career.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: And you stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> through the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span> in 1935 at which time I went to <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> and there I went in the ROTC, so again we've got another three or four years, three years of military and I was eligible to become an officer by then with six years of military under my belt, but I wasn't old enough.</sentence><sentence id="18">In those days you had to be twenty-one to be...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: An officer...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: A lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="24">So that began my relationship with the army.</sentence><sentence id="25">Now I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in <span class="BUILDING">St.Lawrence University</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, and at this time...it was getting close to 1940...it was in "38 and "39, and my family managed through an organization called HIAS to bring into this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> some of my relatives who were in the <span class="REGION">German occupied areas</span> and when I...when I heard their story, I just made up my mind that all this was...one man was responsible for all this and his name was Hitler and somehow or other I wanted to kill him.</sentence><sentence id="26">Now that sounds terrible in the light of today's world, but at that time when you heard those horror stories, you couldn't do anything but want to destroy this person who was responsible for it, so I switched my allegiance in the army to parachute troops because at that time parachute troops were trained to blow up <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, blow up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, drop behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span>, assassinate, execute and all this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="27">But during our period of training, it was very strange but many, many people came into parachute troops and before the training was over, we suddenly had ourselves a a regiment of men and now the tactics were not going to be the same.</sentence><sentence id="28">The regiment, incidentally, grew into divisions, and by the time we jumped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> there were three divisions that went in.</sentence><sentence id="29">There was the 101st, the 82nd and the British 36th Airborne, so you can see that the idea of jumping behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and killing Hitler was a long way from potential fruition.</sentence><sentence id="30">It just couldn't happen that way, so that's that's an answer to your question and when did I get in the army or how or why.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Now we won't focus on this.</sentence><sentence id="47">I know you have a very interesting aspect of your military career in terms of the landing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">Could you briefly tell us a little bit about that...what...what exactly your role was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, all...all I can tell you is that the only reason...it was a quirk of fate...the only reason that I ended up with the first group to jump in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> is the man that we had selected as our pathfinder, the day before during the period Eisenhower delayed for twenty-four hours, we had a chance to go up and see what he had done, and we were very dissatisfied with it and my colonel said to me on the way back, Plitt, 1 want you to go in.</sentence><sentence id="53">Take the pathfinder detachment in and I'll meet you on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and put a DSC on your neck.</sentence><sentence id="54">So</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: Distinguished Service Cross?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="61">So I didn't have any choice anyway, but the point is that that put me among...we had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> loads going in, the pathfinders, a total of eighteen people per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> for a total of fifty-four people.</sentence><sentence id="62">And now the actual flight itself over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was nothing but when we got to the <span class="REGION">English Channel</span>, we went down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and there were some very exciting moments when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> were flashing the V for victory sign to us right over...right over head and then when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> we pulled up to five hundred feet.</sentence><sentence id="63">Imagine...up to five hundred feet and we went along the <span class="DLF">line</span>, the <span class="DLF">road</span> that we had all been briefed so carefully on and studied so long, running from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valone</span>...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valone</span> on down to St. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mere-Eglise</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carentan</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="64">And when we got over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">drop zone</span>, boom...there it is.</sentence><sentence id="65">Now if you want to know what went through my mind, I was just as scared as any human being 01:02: could be.</sentence><sentence id="66">Here I was jumping into Festung (fortress) Europe, which was a Nazi dominated <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, German soldiers, and I had an H on my dog tag.</sentence><sentence id="67">Now the H on my dog tag stood for Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="68">At that time the army put your religion on your dog tags and they did it only so that if you need last rites or what have you, they know what you are and what you aren't, and they only had three categories.</sentence><sentence id="69">There was P for Protestant, C for Catholic and H for Hebrew or Jewish, and so there I was, all alone, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, German- occupied, so the first thing I did (coughing)...excuse me...in an attempt to get mobile or as mobile as I could, was to scrap the throwaway things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mask and such as binoculars and such as extra rounds of ammunition, and suddenly I got so I could move around with a great degree of ease, and during this period I was able to pick up a hundred and one men.</sentence><sentence id="70">Strangely enough, we were the 101st Airborne.</sentence><sentence id="71">I picked up a hundred and one men and we attacked the gun position, which was the division mission.</sentence><sentence id="72">Now the reason we did that is that we were supposed to be on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> for thirty minutes, and after that hearing our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> come in, we would put the lights on.</sentence><sentence id="73">That's what we jumped for...the pathfinders...put the lights on and guide the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> in.</sentence><sentence id="74">For a long time, it got to be very thin and tight and for a long time I thought maybe Eisenhower has canceled again, in which case we got to stay here for twenty-four more hours and sweat it out, or...and before the or really had a chance to take hold, we could hear the drone of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming over.</sentence><sentence id="75">For our whole, the first part of the mission, the pathfinder mission was worthless, because these were new pilots who had never flown in combat before and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-aircraft</span> started coming up at them,</sentence><sentence id="77">they broke from formation.</sentence><sentence id="78">They dropped troops in the <span class="DLF">Channel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">They dropped them all the way north to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> and all the way south to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carentan</span>, and so that part of the mission just wasn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: But you still were one of the first ones to...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Well, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="105">I was in the first fifty-four.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: I want to move now to your role in a very important historical moment that you had and that's in the capture of...in the apprehension and the capture of two major figures in Nazi...the Nazi rule of Germany and in the destruction of the Jews, and I understand the first one you captured was Robert Ley.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Could you tell us about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Yeah, it's a very interesting story.</sentence><sentence id="115">We had an arrangement with the Burgermeisters of the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, that if they had any known what would later become termed as war criminals, in their <span class="REGION">area</span>, they were to notify us.</sentence><sentence id="116">If they intended to hold their job as Burgermeister, they better do it.</sentence><sentence id="117">And so we got a call one night.</sentence><sentence id="118">I don't know who was on the board...got a call from a Burgermeister telling us about this man that was living in a certain <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we entered the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that he was supposed to occupy and he did.</sentence><sentence id="120">He was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the minute we came in the <span class="DLF">door</span>, he reached for a pill on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night table</span>, and one of my boys knocked it out of his hand, and then he said he didn't know why we were bothering him.</sentence><sentence id="121">He was a professor, a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="122">His name was Disselbruger (ph) and he...what can I tell you...he claimed to have...he never was a Nazi, knew nothing about Nazism and so on.</sentence><sentence id="123">Now I have to take you back for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="124">When VE Day came around, which was May the 8th, my particular unit of the 101st Airborne was in an <span class="REGION">area</span> occupied by 13,000 SS troops.</sentence><sentence id="125">Now there we were, two thousand, now in charge of.</sentence><sentence id="126">,,these people had surrendered, so we took <span class="DLF">blocks</span> where they put their weapons, and <span class="DLF">blocks</span> where they did this, but in order to control these 13,000 people, we had to get MP's...that's military police...from their own units.</sentence><sentence id="127">We...we...we just didn't have the manpower to do this, so we did that, and in my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was a full colonel Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="128">At that time I was only a cap...I was a major.</sentence><sentence id="129">In our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> there was a full colonel Nazi, and when I walked in with Disselbruger, he clicked his heels, popped to attention and said Heil.</sentence><sentence id="130">Now how in the hell can a school teacher have a full colonel do this, so I called <span class="BUILDING">division headquarters</span> and I said I'm sending this guy up to you.</sentence><sentence id="131">And I did, and he turned out to be Robert Ley, the Minister of Labor, the guy who sent people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="132">That's the Robert Ley story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: That's a fascinating story.</sentence><sentence id="153">So his subordinate gave him away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Well, yeah, you could call a full colonel his 01:04: subordinate, but once you knew that he was senior to a full colonel, you knew you had something.</sentence><sentence id="157">But I didn't know who he was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Now you also had a very important role in the apprehension and the capture of Julius Streicher, who was the leading propagandist, anti-Semitic propagandist for the Nazi movement...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, that that was a more solitary role because I got him by myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Could you tell us about how that came about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: We also got a tip that there was a a high ranking Nazi living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Widering</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and his name we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="173">I thought it was Heinrich Himmler from the description, but I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> of my own and I didn't have an interpreter of my own at the time, so I borrowed another guy's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and his driver and the three of us went up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, chalet, chateau, whatever you want to call it, and I entered, my 45 in hand, and I went upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="174">There was a man sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">easel</span> to his right painting the opposite Alp, and I asked him his name and he told me Joseph Seeler (ph), and I said where's your identification papers, and he reached right in back and he pulled out an identification paper made out to the name of Joseph Seeler.</sentence><sentence id="175">Now it didn't hit me quite that fast that this was Julius Streicher, and I began asking him things about Himmler, because I thought I had the wrong guy, and he said he knew nothing about politics.</sentence><sentence id="176">He was a painter.</sentence><sentence id="177">He knew nothing about anything that had to do with what I was interested in and then I don't know why I said, and what about Julius Streicher, and he said: "Ja, der bin Ich."</sentence><sentence id="178">Now I got that only from the J S on his work papers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: JS?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Joseph Seeler was Julius Streicher. "</sentence><sentence id="189">Ja, der bin Ich", which when translated into English reads yes, that's who I am.</sentence><sentence id="190">Now we had no further interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="191">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> on the way, he and I were in the back.</sentence><sentence id="192">I had my gun riding his ribs so nothing was going to happen there.</sentence><sentence id="193">He wasn't going to jump out or commit suicide or anything, and I said to him...this is the only interrogation he got from me...I said to him: "Sind Sie der Streicher der war gegendie Juden?",</sentence><sentence id="194">which when translated means, are you the Streicher who was against the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="195">And he very calmly said: "Ja, der bin Ich", which meant yes, that's who Iam, but he might just as well have said so what.</sentence><sentence id="196">I mean he was arrogant to the very end, so much so that when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgarten</span>...oh, I'm sorry...I stopped at my <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> to notify them I was bringing him in and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertchesgarten</span> was about forty miles away from us.</sentence><sentence id="197">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertchesgarten</span>, as he was getting out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>, I booted him a little bit so that accelerate his departure, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was loaded with reporters and this, that and the other, and one reporter came up to me and he said, you know, you just killed the greatest story of the war.</sentence><sentence id="198">I said how.</sentence><sentence id="199">He said can you imagine if a guy named Kohn or Goldberg or Levy had captured this arch-anti-Semite, what a great story it would be.</sentence><sentence id="200">I said why.</sentence><sentence id="201">He said because a Jew would be doing this, and I told him I'm Jewish, and that's when the microphones came into my face and the cameras started clicking away and things started to happen that changed the rest of my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Did you have any chance to interrogate him further or after that...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="223">They took him.</sentence><sentence id="224">I took him to <span class="BUILDING">division headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">They took him on up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> where the army interrogation team was.</sentence><sentence id="226">When I say army that's a division of like a regiment or battalion army, and that's where those people were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: How did you feel capturing Ley and even and capturing Streicher?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Well, with Ley I just felt it was a part of my job and because there was no direct relationship between Ley and Streicher and between Ley and and what was going on in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, but with Streicher there was a very direct relationship.</sentence><sentence id="235">With Ley I didn't even go to division with him.</sentence><sentence id="236">I sent him up with a couple of my men because I didn't...we didn't know then that it was Ley either, you know, but I sent him up with a couple of my men and with Streicher there was a very personal feeling about the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="237">I can tell you myself not killing him from time to time when I had the opportunity, but I had two other people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and war or not war you just don't kill people who surrendered, so that's the story of Julius Streicher.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: That's an important story.</sentence><sentence id="243">You also had participated I guess earlier than this in the entry into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="247">That was...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Could you tell us about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Well, that's...that's a moment that will will live forever.</sentence><sentence id="253">The most outstanding moment of this whole thing, and I'll never forget the word was as we got in there and it was a horrible sight...everything was, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> they lived in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> that they were burned in, and which incidentally were 01:06: _<span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and as we got there, moving up into this <span class="REGION">area</span>, one of the men I was with said look at those <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>, and another officer standing next to him said no, it's <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">That's the plural for <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">I'll never forget that because that whole moment was just unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="256">These people were sitting on <span class="DLF">stoops</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">porches</span> and on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">Their bodies were totally emaciated.</sentence><sentence id="258">Their legs were swollen.</sentence><sentence id="259">It was...it was an unbelievable time and the very same date that we went through stands there today because I've been back and it's just...it's a moment that is very difficult to describe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Do you remember the exact day on which you entered?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: No, I don't.</sentence><sentence id="271">1 remember May 8th, you know.</sentence><sentence id="272">I've got those dates, but I can't give you the exact day, but I can tell you that about two weeks before...maybe ten days before the 8th of May, I saw people walking on the <span class="DLF">road</span> wearing what we later found out was the uniform of the inmates of the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but I had never seen that before...a pajama looking thing with a blue and a grey.</sentence><sentence id="273">And I said what the hell is this.</sentence><sentence id="274">They got another army here we don't know about.</sentence><sentence id="275">They were walking along the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and this is in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span>, but as you got into <span class="REGION">areas</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and what have you, you were getting into the areas of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and how and why they were out I can't tell you, but they were</sentence><sentence id="277">out there and not with a guard, because the guard would have been a German.</sentence><sentence id="278">We would have shot him.</sentence><sentence id="279">We would have had a fire fight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Had you been prepared by the army or anything you had read or information for what you would see in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: No way.</sentence><sentence id="295">Had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="296">I knew of the horror things that had happened through the cousins of mine that came back from there in 1940 and "39, but they didn't describe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">They didn't know anything about that.</sentence><sentence id="298">What they could describe was how a <span class="DLF">store window</span> would be broken, a person would be taken off the <span class="DLF">street</span>, if you were a doctor you couldn't practice, if you were a teacher you couldn't teach, if you wrote a book it wouldn't be published...those things I knew, but I didn't know anything about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: The soldiers you were with and since you were an officer, the American soldiers you were with, did did they understand?</sentence><sentence id="305">Did you have...did you feel that you understood in a different way because you were a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="306">Was there something you could translate...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="311">I think this thing was so horrible that it really didn't matter what you were, what your religious background was, this thing was so horrendous that no matter who you were or what you were, it was going to plague you.</sentence><sentence id="312">You see, one of the reasons for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and one of the reasons for the expression that the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> use frequently now is "Never Again," and I have to tell you that anyone of my troops that went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> with us would not become a parent of a skinhead or a neo-Nazi or any one of those things, because what they say could never be duplicated in history and hopefully never will be, it was so horrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Turning to your return to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, were you able to translate, tell people when you came back, what you had seen so that they could understand?</sentence><sentence id="317">Did they believe you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: We didn't...we didn't dwell on that at all.</sentence><sentence id="321">When I came back, obviously I didn't have a civilian job.</sentence><sentence id="322">I was still in the service, until January of "46, but the B'nai B'rith and the Anti-Defamation League had me going out to lunches and dinners to talk and it was a very propitious subject at that time.</sentence><sentence id="323">The war had just ended and we focused on the Julius Streicher story and never on the other facets that we're talking about today, so...and we also talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, but we just never got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachaus</span> of the world or any of that.</sentence><sentence id="324">It it didn't come up so I didn't paint that picture as I have just tried to do for you.</sentence><sentence id="325">It was...the picture was horrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Something that you will always remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Well, you have to...you have to realize that there's a camaraderie and a fraternalism in the service that doesn't exist anywhere that I know of in civilian life, particularly troops who have been engaged in combat together and who have survived, and there was a resentment but a friendly resentment from all of my friends because as we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, there was a headline in the paper...17,000 troops returning.</sentence><sentence id="405">Included among them is Henry Plitt, the man who captured Julius Streicher.</sentence><sentence id="406">And so out of 17,000, they named one name and the guys started to get pretty irked with that and when I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, I was interviewed by the press and they asked what my post-war plans were, and I said I would like to take a contingent down to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and find Hitler because I'm sure he's alive down there, and I figured this was going to turn into another job.</sentence><sentence id="407">At that point I didn't know what the future held for me, but of course it was pooh-poohed and it never happened, but it was another headline in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, so we treated it very lightly.</sentence><sentence id="408">We treated it very lightly.</sentence><sentence id="409">It was kind of a fun thing except I left out a whole segment here.</sentence><sentence id="410">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on what was known as the hero's tour.</sentence><sentence id="411">Those were people who were highly decorated and what have you, and their mission was to sell war bonds.</sentence><sentence id="412">Now in those days we didn't finance a war from taxes or from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">We financed the war from our own people 1:10: putting up the money to fight the war, and so I spent time here and my assignment was the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the president of the company and the vice president and all those people.</sentence><sentence id="414">They were very lovely people, and one of them said to me if you come back in one piece, call us.</sentence><sentence id="415">Now my speeches for the ADL and the B'nai B'rith and what have you, had gotten kind of tired and I called Paramount and they said you're going to be the first executive trainee that we put to work post-war, and if you read Leonard Goldenson...he was the former chairman of the board of ABC...if you read his book called "Beating the Odds," he tells the story of how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paramount</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">Now that was in 1946.</sentence><sentence id="417">In 1973 I bought half of that <span class="BUILDING">theater chain</span> and in 1978 I bought the rest of it.</sentence><sentence id="418">And that's what Streicher had to do for me.</sentence><sentence id="419">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE DISTORTED END OF SIDE A</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: Well, what what actually happened (cough) is that I was supposed to be a trainee and I was supposed to learn all there was to know about theater operation, construction, projection, sound, etc.</sentence><sentence id="448">with the idea in mind that I would go back to Europe and I would begin to put together deals for Paramount to become as important in Europe as they were here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="449">What actually happened is during the period of my training, I ingratiated myself...not intentionally...I didn't suck up to this guy, but I ingratiated myself with a man by the name of E.

B. Richards resented this.</sentence><sentence id="464">He wasn't going to have any part of it.</sentence><sentence id="465">So Leonard Goldensen who was then heading the theater division, but he really wasn't over E.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="530">Q: Now a major portion of your life in addition, of course, to your professional career and your impact in the entertainment industry, has been charitable work.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="534">Q: What got you...how did you get involved in...particularly in your...has it any relationship to your experiences during the war?</sentence><sentence id="535">Does it...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: Initially no.</sentence><sentence id="539">Subsequently yes.</sentence><sentence id="540">My my real initial involvement in charity work was in 1949 I was then kind of general manager of the Richards, ex-Richards circuit, now Paramount, and Leonard Goldensen again who had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that we in our <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> cooperate in fund raising and I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> to run on my screen, but I couldn't find anybody to make the collections so...because it was Mother's Day that Sunday...so instead of continuing to seek people who said no, I can't go because it's Mother's Day, I called a meeting with an ad for the cerebral palsy parents in <span class="REGION">Orleans Parish</span>, and they came to the meeting and because they couldn't leave their kids alone at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the kids were with them, and I saw these kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> by any matter or means, but it was a heavy sympathy factor to see these kids that just didn't have appropriate treatment, didn't have appropriate diagnostic work, if the diagnosis was right they didn't have the disciplines to do it because it could have been dental, it could have been orthopedic, it could have been any number of things, and they just didn't have the doctors for it and not only that, they couldn't diagnosis it, so I kind of fell in love with that, and in short order I took over the organization and then I became the president of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New Orleans, subsequently Cerebral Palsy Association of Louisiana, then Regional Vice President of the national organization covering the South, and during all this, I would travel to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and I would meet with interested people and parents and I would get them going.</sentence><sentence id="541">Later on, I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and there I really don't do very much of anything, but subsequently to that I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and there I get back into cerebral palsy and I become the chairman of that organization for three years, which takes us now 01:14: to 1967 at which time I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the Six Day War.</sentence></p></dialogue>
