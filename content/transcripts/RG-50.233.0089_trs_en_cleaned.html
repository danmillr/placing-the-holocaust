<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: From what time was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: That started also in the late "30's.</sentence><sentence id="22">I would say "38 and the kids would throw stones, you know kids are cruel and not being allowed to go many <span class="NPIP">places</span>, was a hardship on the kids.</sentence></p></dialogue>
