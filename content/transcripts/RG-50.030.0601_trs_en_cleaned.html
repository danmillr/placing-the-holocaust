<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: Where were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, right in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: So what was your childhood like?</sentence><sentence id="45">Tell me your earliest memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Well, there was my father and my mother and my older brother who was five years older.</sentence><sentence id="49">And then a stepbrother, Paul, who was much order, 17 years older, who really didn't live with us, but he was part of the family.</sentence><sentence id="50">And my father was much older than my mother.</sentence><sentence id="51">My father was 18 years older than my mother, and so he always seemed more like my grandfather to me.</sentence><sentence id="52">And my mother was 35 when I was born, so compared to how I felt at 35 or see other people being 35 now, she seemed much older, too.</sentence><sentence id="53">And we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">And so my father was a lawyer, an</sentence><sentence id="56">attorney, and he had his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> -- I think we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> -- I'm not sure -- of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And he had an <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> on the mezzanine of that same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, so he would always come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch at 1:00 o'clock, around the time that I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">And that was our main meal at that time.</sentence><sentence id="59">And in those days, children did not go out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="60">There was always somebody with me, a Fraulein type.</sentence><sentence id="61">And I was taken everywhere, to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and ice skating.</sentence><sentence id="62">My father took me ice skating.</sentence><sentence id="63">And there was no such thing as really playing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">But we did take summer vacations, lengthy summer vacations to either a different part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">And so then I think we were able to play freely.</sentence><sentence id="66">But during the year, we were pretty constricted.</sentence><sentence id="67">My brother and I were not too close.</sentence><sentence id="68">The ideas in those days made a lot of difference.</sentence><sentence id="69">And he was an ardent boy scout and he thought all of my interests were silly and superficial.</sentence><sentence id="70">But whenever I was sick -- and I seemed to have been sick a good deal in those days with colds and flu and so forth - - he would play games and especially chess with me.</sentence><sentence id="71">And I just recently picked it up again.</sentence><sentence id="72">So that's been fun.</sentence><sentence id="73">And so I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">And I don't remember much about it except for a gym teacher who was very -- who looked more like a snowman or a snowwoman.</sentence><sentence id="75">She was built that way.</sentence><sentence id="76">And I never liked <span class="BUILDING">gym</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">So I think that was four grades or five grades.</sentence><sentence id="78">And then I went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">I believe it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luithlen</span>, L-U-I-T-H-L-E-N. And somehow, even though Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after awhile when Hitler came, I think I remained in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there somehow until I could leave.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: So the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that you attended, were they -- were there Jewish and non-Jewish children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="117">Definitely.</sentence><sentence id="118">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="119">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="120">And then in this <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> we had religion classes, and they were done with release time.</sentence><sentence id="121">In other words, the Protestant children would go one <span class="NPIP">place</span> for instruction and the Catholic children to another and the Jewish children to another.</sentence><sentence id="122">And that's when I began to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="123">My parents really didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="124">They would go to their parents or my father's parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> occasionally over the -- the Yom Kippur, over the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="125">But otherwise, no, there wasn't much celebration of holidays.</sentence><sentence id="126">And in fact, we had a Christmas tree for many years until I made my mother buy a menorah when I was old enough to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="127">And then when I was a tween or an early teenager, we would go to <span class="BUILDING">children's services</span>, the young people's services at the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienn</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: But I must have went -- I think I went mostly for the boys who also attended and then we could all go skating afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="129">So I didn't take all that very seriously at that time.</sentence><sentence id="130">My earliest memory of there being something wrong politically or worrying about what's going to happen to Jewish people was I think in 1934 when I remember going on vacation by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with my parents to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Gastein</span>, a resort-type thing.</sentence><sentence id="131">And we got there the evening, at night when it was dark.</sentence><sentence id="132">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was in the valley, and we came down from the</sentence><sentence id="134"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> or <span class="DLF">hill</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="135">And all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, were lit up and there were candles in the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">And apparently a chancellor from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and his name was Dollfuss, had died.</sentence><sentence id="137">I don't know whether he died or was killed.</sentence><sentence id="138">But he was known to be very sympathetic to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="139">And so it was eerie that he was so mourned or so celebrated.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I guess those lights are something I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="141">And also because my father was older he would always worry about whether he'd die before my mother and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="142">And he worried a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="143">My mother was a worrywart, too.</sentence><sentence id="144">And I've become a worrywart as well.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I married one.</sentence><sentence id="146">I married one, too.</sentence><sentence id="147">But my father was always worried about the times or money or clients or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="148">And he was very serious.</sentence><sentence id="149">He was quite an intellectual person.</sentence><sentence id="150">He was always reading.</sentence><sentence id="151">So there was really very little game playing in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> except occasionally my brother and I. And the only sport was ice skating.</sentence><sentence id="152">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnastic classes</span> as a little girl next door.</sentence><sentence id="153">And swimming, I think.</sentence><sentence id="154">So somehow when Hitler came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and was practically invited into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, somehow it wasn't a surprise because we had always lived with that kind of fear.</sentence><sentence id="155">So I don't know what else I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="156">I had a few good friends, but the friends I had went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but they lived other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">So it wasn't like you could get together after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">You had to make a play date or something.</sentence><sentence id="159">A little older than a play date.</sentence><sentence id="160">And one friend, Francie, did come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I did see her once or twice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">Oh, and another friend, Eva Schiffer.</sentence><sentence id="162">She was a real intellectual.</sentence><sentence id="163">My father adored her.</sentence><sentence id="164">And she lived around the corner.</sentence><sentence id="165">And my grades were always compared to hers.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I think she's a retired professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amherst</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Andover</span> now, and we are out of touch, although we were back in touch in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">And then one friend went to <span class="REGION">South America</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, and we completely lost touch.</sentence><sentence id="168">And a boy I liked whet to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">So everybody was spread out.</sentence><sentence id="170">There was no cohesiveness.</sentence><sentence id="171">And I think even now I envy some of my friends who grew up in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and had their <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> crowd and go to reunions and all these memories.</sentence><sentence id="172">So I don't have that.</sentence><sentence id="173">So I don't know what else should I tell you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: So do you remember feeling -- you didn't -- did you recognize or celebrate any Jewish holidays in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Well, we then eventually bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">menorah</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">I don't remember celebrating Hanukkah.</sentence><sentence id="226">No, really, I don't think we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Were a lot of your friends Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Yeah, they were all Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: So growing up did you experience any anti-Semitism in your --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Not immediately.</sentence><sentence id="236">Not among my friends, I didn't, because I guess I just didn't -- wasn't open to that because there was nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="237">And we had non-Jewish help, Frauleins and so forth, a housekeeper.</sentence><sentence id="238">But I didn't experience anything from them.</sentence><sentence id="239">And</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="247">of course, they had to leave as soon as Hitler came.</sentence><sentence id="248">Other people in my life, my gym teacher, my aunt was my piano teacher.</sentence><sentence id="249">And they were all Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="250">But we talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="251">And my father would talk about the things that Hitler did.</sentence><sentence id="252">And we would -- this is before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but we were aware of the Nuremburg laws and of what happens, and you know, and how you have to -- how you can't work any more and you can't have any non-Jewish help.</sentence><sentence id="253">My father had to get rid of his secretary.</sentence><sentence id="254">He had one secretary who was with him for 30 years or something.</sentence><sentence id="255">But personally, I can't say I experienced it.</sentence><sentence id="256">My main experience was years later when I visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the first time, I think, in "69.</sentence><sentence id="257">Do you want to hear that story?</sentence><sentence id="258">Yeah?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Uh-hmm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: With my husband.</sentence><sentence id="277">And since he didn't speak German, we couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, but we went to a lot of operas.</sentence><sentence id="278">And so one night we went to the <span class="BUILDING">oper</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: And we also stayed at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> right across from the <span class="BUILDING">oper</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: We didn't have time to eat beforehand, so we went to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> nearby there afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="281">And I think generally in there when a <span class="NPIP">place</span> is crowded, they don't have you necessarily wait.</sentence><sentence id="282">They seat you with somebody.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="283">And so we were seated with this man who was a bit older than I am, maybe 10, 15 years older than I was at the time.</sentence><sentence id="284">Started talking somehow.</sentence><sentence id="285">And I spoke a little broken German.</sentence><sentence id="286">And he said, "Oh, how come your German is so good?"</sentence><sentence id="287">or something.</sentence><sentence id="288">And I said, "Well, I'm glad you think it's good."</sentence><sentence id="289">I said, "I used to live here."</sentence><sentence id="290">And he said, "Oh?"</sentence><sentence id="291">And I said, "Well, I left in 1939.</sentence><sentence id="292">I had to leave when Hitler came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austri</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A:" And so he said, "Oh," and then he fell silent.</sentence><sentence id="294">Oh, and he had been some kind of movie producer or something.</sentence><sentence id="295">Anyway, he became silent and five minutes later he got up.</sentence><sentence id="296">And it felt very chilly.</sentence><sentence id="297">The Austrians were never overly friendly, and they were more Nazis than the Germans were, I think.</sentence><sentence id="298">So again, it was not surprising, but at the same time it was extremely uncomfortable.</sentence><sentence id="299">And just such a tiny little incident that I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="300">So I think if I had experienced more incidents and more graphic incidents, I would have remembered.</sentence><sentence id="301">But I just did not happen to be with people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: How did the Nuremburg laws or I guess the Nazi rise to power, how did it affect you and your family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Well, my father I think not being able to have anybody working for you who is even partially Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="314">So that was the big thing.</sentence><sentence id="315">And that meant that -- you know, we had household help, a maid.</sentence><sentence id="316">And everybody was very loyal and friendly and they suddenly had to disappear.</sentence><sentence id="317">For my father, no help in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was shrinking.</sentence><sentence id="318">He was upset about that.</sentence><sentence id="319">And so there wasn't anybody in my family, whether -- we were just Jewish, so that wasn't in question, whether we had a grandfather or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="320">So I think that was the main thing.</sentence><sentence id="321">What else was in there?</sentence><sentence id="322">I forgot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: You said that your father talked about the things that Hitler was doing.</sentence><sentence id="340">Were you aware of the Naziism and what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Yeah, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="344">As I look back, we were very politically aware as children or teenagers.</sentence><sentence id="345">Much more so than I later found kids either in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> being.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="346">Yeah, we were.</sentence><sentence id="347">And then, of course, when the annexation started.</sentence><sentence id="348">And my mother's half-sister lived, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, her husband, and he was -- I mean, they were very well- situated.</sentence><sentence id="349">He was the president of a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">And they refused to leave.</sentence><sentence id="351">I mean, this whole business over what's going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="352">In fact, I had an uncle and an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienn</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: And he was a government employee.</sentence><sentence id="354">And I guess he was half Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="355">He thought it would never happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="356">And they didn't leave, and they perished in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">My aunt and uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> left in time.</sentence><sentence id="358">Their children made them leave just in time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Do you recall -- What are your memories of Hitler coming to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence><sentence id="366">Do you recall when the change happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="370">I remember that something -- he immediately took over the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span>, the one means of communication.</sentence><sentence id="371">And I remember -- of course there were a lot of Nazi soldiers around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they were marching in the <span class="DLF">Ringstrasse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="373">And then real fear settled in because we then -- well, it was after Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="374">And I guess I heard about Kristallnacht later.</sentence><sentence id="375">I didn't see any of those terrible things happening on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="376">But then we began to be really afraid.</sentence><sentence id="377">The person in power was the superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">And it was a question of whether he was going to be our friend or foe.</sentence><sentence id="379">And everything depended on him.</sentence><sentence id="380">And so I think we were all in fear that he would say yes, such and such, the Grosses living there, Jewish, and go take them.</sentence><sentence id="381">But fortunately that never happened.</sentence><sentence id="382">My brother actually left the year before.</sentence><sentence id="383">He left soon after Hitler came to power, and he went tom <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and later on to <span class="REGION">South America</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolivi</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: So I was the only one left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">And my stepbrother had married.</sentence><sentence id="386">And he was -- my father's first wife was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="387">So my stepbrother for certain didn't grow up Jewish, but he didn't grow up with anything else either, just nondenominational.</sentence><sentence id="388">And he married a Jewish woman, one whose sister and brother-in- law actually emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="389">But they left.</sentence><sentence id="390">His biological mother was related to a very prominent Czech shoe manufacturer.</sentence><sentence id="391">And they were willing to help them get out, but only if he -- if they both converted and didn't ever acknowledge their Jewish family any more, which they did.</sentence><sentence id="392">But everybody had to survive in those days.</sentence><sentence id="393">That's what they had to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Do you recall --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: You go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: -- when the decision was made that you would leave on the Kindertransport?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Well, I think it was somehow made early in the year.</sentence><sentence id="412">Early "39, it must have been.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="413">But the understanding -- all this was, it didn't seem like such a tragic thing because the understanding always was that my parents would come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> two months later.</sentence><sentence id="414">And then after I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British quarter</span> was closed so they couldn't come.</sentence><sentence id="415">And they very fortunately were able to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">And my father subsequently died here two years later, so I never did see him again.</sentence><sentence id="417">But the good-byes were not that terrible because it was like, "So long.</sentence><sentence id="418">I'm going to see you in a couple of months."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: What kind of preparation went into it?</sentence><sentence id="420">I mean, did you pack?</sentence><sentence id="421">Did your mother do it for you?</sentence><sentence id="422">What was the feeling in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Well, ironically, it was kind of up.</sentence><sentence id="424">We bought clothes and packed clothes.</sentence><sentence id="425">You're going to need this and you're going to need that.</sentence><sentence id="426">And so it was a rather positive preparation.</sentence><sentence id="427">Kind of naive, really, when you think about it.</sentence><sentence id="428">So I did not understand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: How old were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
