<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: When did you start becoming aware of Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: I think because of the interest in reading we had, we were really quite young, because Mother's two spinster sisters had both been to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="138">Quite unusual at that particular time is these young women, they were teachers, basically, they had both been in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="139">My Aunt Agnes had -- had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a number of times and studied there.</sentence><sentence id="140">Aunt Belle had been with her also.</sentence><sentence id="141">But we would have, when Aunt Belle and Aunt -- Aunt Agnes were there, talks about Europe and visiting about Europe.</sentence><sentence id="142">So really as younger people we were aware of at least Europe.</sentence><sentence id="143">Not the rest of the world, but Europe, certainly.</sentence><sentence id="144">And I'm speaking now</sentence><sentence id="146">of -- of ages probably of 10 and 12, maybe eight, we were aware of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="147">News-wise, later though, because it wasn't of course until I was getting into later <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> that the world news became more and more important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Did your parents talk that over with you?</sentence><sentence id="160">How aware were you of the situation getting worse in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: We were aware because first of all we had the "Des Moines Register," the state paper that the folks read avidly, they would discuss it.</sentence><sentence id="164">We had radio news basically as well, too.</sentence><sentence id="165">So I think probably as -- as things were beginning to develop, I remember discussions of the Spanish Civil War, that would be what, in the late 1930's.</sentence><sentence id="166">And then of course when the war itself began in the first or second of September 1939, why, we were much, much aware of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: What was your personal reaction when -- in September "39?</sentence><sentence id="172">Do you remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes, [remember quite clearly because that morning, I remember coming into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, the paper was there and Dad was very disturbed, having read the -- the war that -- the word had come that -- that of course as we remember, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had moved into the -- in-into -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span>, and then that the British gave the ultimatum and I remember the talk, we all heard Neville Chamberlain saying that they were given ultimatum, we have rece -- [indecipherable] undertaking, so</sentence><sentence id="177">Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 we're therefore at war.</sentence><sentence id="178">I remember Dad being disturbed, Mother to a degree too, but I-I think -- I think maybe -- maybe Dad was more evident about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: And you were in what <span class="BUILDING">grade</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Well, I would have been at that time, which was 1939, in -- I'd bega -- I began <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a five year old in 1930, so I-- I would have been about the eighth or ninth grade at that time, or in that period.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Did you feel threatened at all by that news?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Not really, not really.</sentence><sentence id="190">That came a bit later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Okay, so you continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1939.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: That's right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: And your life did not change immediately?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Correct, correct, but the real -- the real change came in April of 1940, the next spring, during the first [indecipherable] of course it was the so-called static war, nothing happening basically.</sentence><sentence id="200">But it was in April, the next April, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> moved into first <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and then the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span>, and that was very -- very meaningful because I remember so well of going over that morning to Grandma and Grandpa's, they're still living.</sentence><sentence id="201">This time they were in -- in the 80's.</sentence><sentence id="202">But I can picture just as we talk right now, Grandpa Peterson sitting there in the sun in the early morning as if he were stunned.</sentence><sentence id="203">The war did come.</sentence><sentence id="204">And I said in</sentence><sentence id="206">Interview with Richard Peterson deg April 6, 1999 Danish, Bedstefar [Danish].</sentence><sentence id="207">Yeah, da -- I'll put it sa -- put it in Danish again.[Speaks Danish here] The Germans have <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And then in English he says, poor little <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, she couldn't do a thing.</sentence><sentence id="209">She couldn't do a thing.</sentence><sentence id="210">And he just -- he'd been in the German army, you se -- oh, I'm sorry, the -- the Danish army.</sentence><sentence id="211">And of course it was a great history in the 1860's when Grandpa was in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> growing up, of the first -- you know, th-the first war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">And then of course the World War II is -- World War -- war was there also, but this was a really traumatic thing for them.</sentence><sentence id="213">And we -- we sensed that, we could see that in -- in--in their -- in their make-up, what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: And did you respond in any way, did you feel threatened then, because of the connection to your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Oh, I think -- I think not too much at that time.</sentence><sentence id="233">We knew things of course were getting much more so because following that of course we recall <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> fell, and then of course <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> moved into -- in to the low countries and on and then of course there was a lot of awareness when the German [indecipherable] went through the Ardennes, to the great -- the great shock and surprise of the French and British.</sentence><sentence id="234">And then of course the -- the escape of the British at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.038" long="2.378">Dunkirk</span> to get across, we -- that was a lot in the news, we were very, very aware of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: So this is a young -- as a teenager, you followed in the news.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Quite a bit, because in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we would also -- not by tha -- by this time we're getting into -- into -- into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">I would have begun <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- I began <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, it would have been in -- it had begun in 1939.</sentence><sentence id="245">I begun just that fall.</sentence><sentence id="246">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> the current affairs magazines, the teachers were visiting about it back and forth, even though the war was still in Europe, of course, basically.</sentence><sentence id="247">But we were quite aware of it, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Up to that point, did you have any Jewish friends, were there any Jewish families living in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="256">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="257">Polish friends as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="258">I was in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> with Marvin Richards, with Stanley Krazney(ph), both of Jewish -- and some -- and some girls, too.</sentence><sentence id="259">So we -- we -- we had good friends that were, yes.</sentence><sentence id="260">We were just youngsters, of course, but then on into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we -- we had number of Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Council Bluffs</span>, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: And did you read anything in the newspaper about what was happening to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 30's and so forth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: To my recollection, nothing that I recall, no.</sentence><sentence id="270">Although I do recall Dad brought ho -- brought <span class="BUILDING">hom</span> -- brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a story once from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, very facetious, a fun story.</sentence><sentence id="271">He had some Jewish clients and th -- interestingly enough, h -- Dad represented one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, the other attorney in his o -- the other people, and they were</sentence><sentence id="273">visiting back and forth, the Jewish gentlemen ga -- came quite involved back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="274">And finally as they left, the first group left, Dad's client remained, leaned over and says, can you blame Hitler?</sentence><sentence id="275">Can you blame Hitler?</sentence><sentence id="276">But that -- that was a kind of a -- of a joke sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="277">But there had been word obviously at the time that things were happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as far as anti-Semitic things basically, but no greater awareness at the time, I would say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: And no evidence --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: As far as I would --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: -- of anti -- and no evidence of anti-Semitism in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: No, I think not.</sentence><sentence id="292">We had at that time a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is still there, the congregation no long -- but the -- i-it was a fairly active <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">And I don't ever, ever recall at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any -- any suggestion of anti-Semitism at all.</sentence><sentence id="295">The wa -- ma -- dad -- Mother and Dad were both very, very liberal in attitude, and very, very tolerant.</sentence><sentence id="296">Matter of fact we had Jewish neighbors lived right next door to us.</sentence><sentence id="297">And there -- there was never, to my recollection, any reflection about them as individuals.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Okay, so I assume then as things go on, you're a student at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you're following world affairs and then when -- what happened when Pearl Harbor occurred?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: We got the word, of course, that Sunday afternoon at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">They're saying, we interrupt this news [indecipherable] and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="312">A great -- a great shocking thing.</sentence><sentence id="313">At this time, age 16, realized that not fully as yet, but it was going to affect us.</sentence><sentence id="314">The next morning in the "Des Moines Register" there appeared a -- a -- the name was Ding Darling, he was one of the leading cartoonists in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and here was this -- this drawing.</sentence><sentence id="315">It was of Uncle Sam kneeling, holding in his arms a sailor with a knife in his back.</sentence><sentence id="316">And Uncle Sam was looking up in fury and anger, shaking his fist at the departing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">Powerful thing.</sentence><sentence id="318">I remem-mem- member very well, and that's one of the first times I ever remember seeing Dad in tears, at that.</sentence><sentence id="319">And that was now Monday morning at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">At <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Abraham Lincoln High School, our principal Mr. Kern, Gerald Kern, a--a very fine educator and he ran a tight <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">He called the entire <span class="BUILDING">school</span> body together, we were in the -- the big, large <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">He perceived in his wisdom how he"!</sentence><sentence id="323">be affecting us, and he had brought -- he brought in a large floor model radio which was up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">And I can see him yet.</sentence><sentence id="325">The <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span>, large but couldn't take all of them, so there were other students in the aisles, the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="326">And we sat there in dead silence, and Mr. Kern turned on President Roosevelt's war message.</sentence><sentence id="327">And how interesting.</sentence><sentence id="328">I thought about it over the years.</sentence><sentence id="329">Over -- over the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>, on the proscenium of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>, in large gothic</sentence><sentence id="331">Interview with Richard Peterson 8 April 6, 1999 letters in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were, ye come to learn, go forth to serve.</sentence><sentence id="332">How rather prophetic looking back, huh, at those times.</sentence><sentence id="333">That was Monday and then of course during the week, difficult.</sentence><sentence id="334">To drop back a bit though, the week before had been a tense week because I remember th-the -- the -- the [indecipherable] this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as we recall, as the special en -- envoys, emissaries and there were big pictures of them in the paper, them smiling and very -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="335">And then came the word about it.</sentence><sentence id="336">But I remember when, during the end of the week as we're reaching -- it would have been in probably December fourth or fifth -- third, fourth or fifth, that the word came that they were re-reaching some kind of an accord, they thought -- I remember saying to Dad, Dad, how lucky -- a war with <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> would be terrible, wouldn't it?</sentence><sentence id="337">And then of course, came the events of Sunday and then Monday, of course, war was declared.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: And so you went on with life as usual at -- in -- in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: To a degree, but it was changing, because we realized things were indeed happening, and they already had, to this extent.</sentence><sentence id="369">The National Guard had been already brought into federal service by that time.</sentence><sentence id="370">I thi -- I think that our local unit, which was the 168" infantry of the na -- 34" division had been mustered in in January the year before.</sentence><sentence id="371">And we were aware of it because a number of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> student seniors were in the National Guard and they were gone.</sentence><sentence id="372">And I</sentence><sentence id="374">remember then, it was in the -- May of that year, which would have been 1941, before the war, but here they made arrangements and I remember being in -- I was in the band and orchestra, and it was always typical that we would play, the orchestra, we would play -- our -- our school march was "The Pilgrim's Chorus" from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tannhauser</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">And -- and Mr. Kern liked it, it was very good.</sentence><sentence id="376">Much better than "Pomp and Circumstance."</sentence><sentence id="377">But I remember being th -- we were practicing and in came the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> seniors and I remember I was so, as a youngster, moved, because here were four, five or six of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students now on active duty, they were there in uniform, they came back to graduate.</sentence><sentence id="378">So that was -- sO we were very much aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="379">And to drop back to your other <span class="NPIP">question</span>, how did it change?</sentence><sentence id="380">We were much aware, the -- the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> paper, "The Echoes" began having items more and more of classmates we had, or students who were now in the service, in the military, back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="381">As well, at our <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> we had ROTC, junior ROTC, we were all in it, even band -- band people had a military band and the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="382">So there was more emphasis all the time.</sentence><sentence id="383">I mean that things are going to happen, young people and you've got training that's going on here, it's going to be helpful to you.</sentence><sentence id="384">So the -- the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> paper as I said, was carrying more and more news about people who graduated, and where they were training and so forth, so we're very much aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="385">And, may I add,</sentence><sentence id="387">the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities began to be directed.</sentence><sentence id="388"><span class="BUILDING">Junior Red Cross</span>, for example, was having more projects.</sentence><sentence id="389">As -- as youngsters, I was involved with the Boy Scouts, the Boy Scout project even at that time was collecting aluminum, s-scrap aluminum to get for the war effort.</sentence><sentence id="390">So we -- were doing, things were happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: Did you ever picture yourself in the army when you were young?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: Not immediately.</sentence><sentence id="417">You suddenly began realizing, as the senior class ahead of us graduating, they were going in, that this was going to be happening to you.</sentence><sentence id="418">So gradually we recog -- it was a part of it, and we were expected to do it and we knew it was coming by that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

it seems that the Germans must have pulled out.</sentence><sentence id="1436">We learned however, later on, that one of our men, fourth platoon was asked and did, because he had good German, go in

that.</sentence><sentence id="1505">But one thing that was pervasive apparently, and this was confirmed by -- by sar -- Dave Sargent, there at the time, sergeant and later on by Lieutenant -- then

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2824">A: Well, it's quite inters -- it's quite interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2825">Number one, there had been a great -- a great tradition, history of tolerance in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2826">Smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> [indecipherable] also.</sentence><sentence id="2827">But early enlightenment, which began in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in the 1820's - 30's, they had -- they had left the monarchy, I mean the -- the actual absolute monarchy and into more of a constitutional monarchy, th-that helped.</sentence><sentence id="2828">A smaller <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, as I mentioned again, and beyond that, I'm not sure, except that there was -- it was indeed a safe haven.</sentence><sentence id="2829">Now, as to how the wonderful escape took place in October, several things I -- I read -- as we read it.</sentence><sentence id="2830">Number one, there had been the great feeling of the Danish people.</sentence><sentence id="2831">The-The-These are not Danish Jews,</sentence><sentence id="2833">Interview with Richard Peterson 8 April 6, 1999 it's Jewish Danes.</sentence><sentence id="2834">A subtle distinction, but it's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2835">Secondly the war situation was turning against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2836">Allies were in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> by that time.</sentence><sentence id="2837"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> had been completed.</sentence><sentence id="2838">The general feeling was -- was different.</sentence><sentence id="2839">The proximity -- the proximity of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> now, made it possible, which might, in a landlocked <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> not have happened, huh.</sentence><sentence id="2840">And the willingness of the Swedes to accept it.</sentence><sentence id="2841">There's a wonderful story told apropos of that, about the Swedish side of it now.</sentence><sentence id="2842">When the time came that was realized the Germans were going to move, to take the Danish Jews, time was short.</sentence><sentence id="2843">It was a matter of days, but they had to somehow -- they meaning the Danish people under their leadership and the resistance get them out.</sentence><sentence id="2844">But they had to have the agreement of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to take them.</sentence><sentence id="2845">They could not deal with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and say -- because that would tip it off.</sentence><sentence id="2846">So what was determined, from what I read, was this, they realized that the Danish leadership, they had to get the agreement of the Swedish crown.</sentence><sentence id="2847">The arrangement was made that they, the Danish people would select, hopefully, that -- a leader of the Danish Jewish community to hopefully visit with the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2848">It was arranged.</sentence><sentence id="2849">And the person selected was Niels Bohr, the great atomic [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2850">The story goes on to say that in-- in Bohr's words he said -- he said, I'm a scientist, not an advocate, he said, why -- well, they said you have th- the standing, the name, the King will -- all right.</sentence><sentence id="2851">It was arranged remarkably</sentence><sentence id="2853">Interview with Richard Peterson degdeg April 6, 1999 [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2854">Then, in just a matter of hours they set this up and apparently then, either -- either by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> -- they're not -- they're -- they're -- they're still -- they're c-careful, or possibly by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British aircraft</span>, the Mosquito coming, take him over, Bohr was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, to probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drottningholm</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span>, the story is told.</sentence><sentence id="2855">He said, in I went, to this massive <span class="BUILDING">palace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2856">Re-Realized what was on my shoulders to try and get this done, to persuade the king.</sentence><sentence id="2857">I was shown into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2858">Had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and th-th-th-the king's attendant was there, basically very fine, he said Dr. Bohr, please wait.</sentence><sentence id="2859">Then he said the moment came, he said [indecipherable] here -- here -- here I am just becoming more tense by the moment.</sentence><sentence id="2860">The <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and they said, Dr. Bohr, the king will see you now.</sentence><sentence id="2861">He said, I stepped in and here was this very pleasant looking gentleman, it was the king, King Gustav.</sentence><sentence id="2862">Gustav Aroff(ph) I think it was.</sentence><sentence id="2863">And he said, I-I have some Swedish.</sentence><sentence id="2864">And he said, I explained in [indecipherable] as best I could the plight of our people, what was going to happen and -- and that we desperately pled for help.</sentence><sentence id="2865">He said, the king, very courteous, stood up.</sentence><sentence id="2866">He said, of course I stood up too.</sentence><sentence id="2867">The king walked to the <span class="DLF">window</span>, looked out.</sentence><sentence id="2868">He said that -- I can [indecipherable] it was probably all of maybe 10 seconds, but he came back and said, Dr. Bohr, your people will be welcome in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2869">And that was it, laid the foundation.</sentence><sentence id="2870">So, a combination of things put together, you see, and of course the -- it was not all --I</sentence><sentence id="2872">mean there were -- there were some problems to getting them -- getting the Danes across or getting the -- the -- the Jews across, the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="2873">Some -- some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> people did charge, others did not, back and forth, but it still was a remarkable, remarkable thing, huh?</sentence><sentence id="2874">Incredible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
