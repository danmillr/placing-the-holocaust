<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: Can you talk about life in the -- and I might be pronouncing this wrong, the wear --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: How long were you there, and -- and what was it like there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Okay, I like to describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">This was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with quite a large Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="115">When the war broke out, they were supposed to -- or they were, actually, making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And of course my -- my father, that was his decision, and</sentence><sentence id="118">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 5 we ga -- went along with it, decided that we would move to the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, maybe the Germans will not get there as fast as they get first to the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, which was really the fact.</sentence><sentence id="119">And also the reason we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> was because my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>, and she still had rel-relatives over there, sisters and -- yeah, sisters mainly, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="120">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>, and in the beginning it sim -- seemed to be okay, but the fact was that -- that our life changed because of not having proper living conditions and <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="121">So it was difficult, and of course my father's livelihood ceased to exist, because he couldn't do what he did at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">And at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my father had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of military uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="123">In other words, it was Boy Scouts, tha -- I mean that led to it, Boy Scout, prepartor -- preparatory military, and then he also branched out to have sports goods like skiing outfits, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="124">So we were doing well, and I don't think he had accumulated a fortune anywhere, or anything, unless I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="125">But we had to leave everything, and just move there.</sentence><sentence id="126">My father organized for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> drawn by two horses, and we took what we could, and the -- just went, and of course we were very lucky, because somehow we were not disturb along the -- the way to -- you know, cause it could have been easily that the Germans would stop us and -- and suspect us of doing something wrong and so on.</sentence><sentence id="127">So we were not stopped, and we went straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: What were the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> like there for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

[</sentence><sentence id="164">indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: An-And so you did have enough food.</sentence><sentence id="166">And what was sanitation like i-in the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Sanitation, well, like I said, there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span>, there were no -- there's no water, but with all this, you get used to it.</sentence><sentence id="168">When the water was brought in, we used our s - - the sanitation was basically almost like before, but the fact was that it was a little harder to obtain it, you know, to -- to work at it, cause water had to be brought in, and -- and they had outies on -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> and whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="169">So that's the way -- that's the</sentence><sentence id="171"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0060 7 only way.</sentence><sentence id="172">If we were left alone in peace, we would have actually adapted to it, but every day they had different regulations, and finally they formed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, where at this -- to this point, there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and then they made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">Luck -- lucky enough where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="174">And this <span class="REGION">area</span> was going to be part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so we didn't have to move.</sentence><sentence id="175">But many other people had to move, and what happened then, they made them move with us.</sentence><sentence id="176">In other words, we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and th -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, which was a little bit larger than -- than normally, so we had to share this with another family, it was a family of a mother and daughter, and a husband, and a grandmother, and they all were together with us.</sentence><sentence id="177">And things begin to -- begin to be quite difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: You were doing some teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Beg your pardon?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: You were doing some teaching w -- at the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Yes, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: What about your own education?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: I started a w -- I had half a year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">I started -- I finished the -- you know, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, and then I went to a pu -- to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">And -- but I always wanted to learn, and I always -- and my parents especially, were very particular, as far as our education is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="204">So I know -- I had a teacher, a -- a group, in group studies where I was taking French.</sentence><sentence id="205">I tried to improve on German, I was taking Latin.</sentence><sentence id="206">I wa -- anything, anything just cause I was so hungry for knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="207">And we also, like I said, we took Hebrew, because my -- my father wanted my brother to -- to learn Hebrew, so we were --</sentence><sentence id="209">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 8 a man was coming for a half an hour, whatever it is, and was teaching us Hebrew, and -- my -- my brother and myself.</sentence><sentence id="210">So -- actually -- and then I was teaching myself a lot of things, cause I was always curious, and so -- so that -- that was my education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: How long did you stay in -- in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we were until 19 -- ninet -- beginning of 19 four -- four -- well, maybe a little -- in 1942, beginning of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="226">And at that time, they evidently wanted to -- to get everybody out, sent the majority of people to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and they had two <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> over there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">One was a <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span>, which unbelievably belonged to my first cousin.</sentence><sentence id="228">A big plant, you know, I don't know how many acres of <span class="REGION">land</span>, with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>, and -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="229">And they have a -- a tremendous <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machinery</span> to cut and polish, and whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="230">And that <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span> was taken over by the Germans to -- and transferred to produce articles and you know, for the war.</sentence><sentence id="231">Like, for example, they manufactured <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ammunition boxes</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span>, and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="232">So they took it over completely.</sentence><sentence id="233">Of course, my cousin and his family were shot during that time.</sentence><sentence id="234">And of course, I don't know if they had any heirs to -- to claim it or whatever it is, but that was the situation.</sentence><sentence id="235">And of course then, like at the end of -- I may wrong as far as timing is concerned, but it might have been the end of "43, or maybe early beginning of "44, where they dissolved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were.</sentence><sentence id="236">We were working there, and I- living there, and whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="237">They arranged a <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were living, like for example men in one tremendous <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, you know, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span>, and women in the other one.</sentence><sentence id="238">So it was like a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, mostly.</sentence><sentence id="239">And -- and we also received one meal a day of</sentence><sentence id="241">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 9 cooked -- cooked food, and then the rest of it we had to organize ourselves, so some people who were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had brought in money, and they, since they knew the non- Jewish people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, they were elbo -- able to communicate with them, and get -- get them to bring money for -- bring food for money, so for them it was easier.</sentence><sentence id="242">For myself and my family it was harder, but we survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> all totaled, before you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, we -- we got there the very end of 1939, you know.</sentence><sentence id="266">That -- that would have been because they said they were going to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="267">So we just took off before the closing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because we knew -- or we had an idea that once we are closed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we wouldn't be able to get out.</sentence><sentence id="268">So that's what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: I want to go back and ask you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: -- one other question about your --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: -- family environment.</sentence><sentence id="278">W-Were y -- were your parents, or was the family particularly political in any way, or -- what were your politics?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: It was -- i-in those days, it was not -- there was no possibility from my point of view, and for what I remember, for any Jewish person to be political We just did what we supposed to do, what we were oud -- allowed to do, and th-there was -- and if there -- we were political, it would have been in the area of -- of Judaism, and speaking of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span></sentence><sentence id="283">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 10 at that time, and -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="284">But other than that, we had no -- not much to say as far as the politics of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were concerned.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1217">Q: Was there any romance between Leon and you in -- in -- before the -- during the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: Yes, yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1220">Yes, th -- not before the war.</sentence><sentence id="1221">That was a funny incident, too.</sentence><sentence id="1222">When we lived already where I -- where I told you the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, before they took us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>, and at that time they were actually concentrating all the people from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, no -- small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, in ve -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And my father borrowed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span>, that was before I -- I had <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1224">And he decided to -- to sew things.</sentence><sentence id="1225">He didn't know how to sew, but he -- he knew how to cut, and prepare the</sentence><sentence id="1227">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0060 42 material, and I knew how to sew.</sentence><sentence id="1228">So we did many things for people, like most of them -- people were coming, and they wanted like a one piece suit, and you know, pockets, and this, and my husband-to-be came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and he wanted my father to make a suit with different hidden pockets here, and here, and here, and whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1229">So my father was doing it for him, and I was the one that was sewing it.</sentence><sentence id="1230">And that was the time I met -- met him.</sentence><sentence id="1231">He was sitting in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with -- as big as this here, here, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1232">And -- and I remember when he came, he had money, he saved money.</sentence><sentence id="1233">He was -- they were very rich, and we went through a -- a time where my father left everything, and the money was not available, because either it was in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="1234">So whatever he brought with them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vearshmeek</span> was not that much to -- but Leon had all this, as a matter of fact, he had it hidden in a shoe -- in a heel of a shoe.</sentence><sentence id="1235">And so -- anyhow -- so the reason I am saying it, because he came with a maybe five or 10 pound bag of apples, and he was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>, and eating one apple after the other, which struck me funny.</sentence><sentence id="1236">And we were not able to buy that, and maybe bought three, four apples for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1237">One -- and so this is how I remember him the first time.</sentence><sentence id="1238">And then, when we were in -- you are tired already, huh?</sentence><sentence id="1239">And then when we were moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, he was moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Myoufka</span> at that time, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1240">And I already lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and -- but they couldn't establish themself to -- to the point where they were useful to do anything, they didn't do anything, they were just in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, living there.</sentence><sentence id="1241">So he -- and there was a doctor there that was from my husband's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, so they were friends.</sentence><sentence id="1242">So they, somehow, somewhat made arrangement, my husband had</sentence><sentence id="1244"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0060 43 diamonds, and money saved, and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1245">So evidently he bribed somebody, and it's awful word to use, isn't it, but it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1246">So that they were able to transfer him.</sentence><sentence id="1247">So they trans -- transferred him, let's say this is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where I was, nearby was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was producing electricity, and they needed people, so my husband and this doctor were transferred here, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1248">So we were nearby, and then I was able to see him, and not once, twice, or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1249">Then they combined all -- the both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> into one, cause they needed people where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1250">So my husband came, and the doctor, and he had a -- a -- he was working, they -- a -- occupied him to be the main person to see to people that got wounded during the work, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1251">So that's how I met my husband, and very casual and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1252">But somehow, we knew each other, evidently he thought more of it than I did, because he took, you know, all the pain to find me after the war, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1253">And when he found me, and when I -- and when they wrote, I was glad in a way, cause it was the only person that was looking for me.</sentence><sentence id="1254">So I -- I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and I came to <span
