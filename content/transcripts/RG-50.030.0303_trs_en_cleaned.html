<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Start off by telling me your name at the time of war, and where you were born, and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5">Ag My name at the time of the war was Fela Yakomovich (ph) in Yiddish, and I lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ozerkoff</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born the tenth month, the fifteenth day of 1926.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell me a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="11">ike It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">The way I understand -- I didn't know at the time but after the war, people that were older than I am told me that the population was like 15,000 all together, and almost one third of the population were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="13">It was a nice little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">We had natural springs there on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">There were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birchwoods</span> and little <span class="BUILDING">cottages</span> where people came in summer for vacation.</sentence><sentence id="16">Life was, I would say considering all the citcumstances in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I felt happy, because I had a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">My father was by trade a jeweler and watchmaker.</sentence><sentence id="18">Watches he sold and repaired but jewelry which most of the time wasn't costume made, people didn't think much of costume jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="19">If they ordered a piece of jewelry it had to be either silver or gold, and it was ordered and my father made these things to order.</sentence><sentence id="20">Many times I used to stand there fascinated watching him pour the gold.</sentence><sentence id="21">It was just like liquid poured in a form and how he fashioned all this.</sentence><sentence id="22">And also the finish and the engraving.</sentence><sentence id="23">It was something -- he was a good craftsman.</sentence><sentence id="24">We were not rich.</sentence><sentence id="25">We did not have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of our own.</sentence><sentence id="26">Where we lived was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">It was going from one side of the street corner into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">But it was one <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, but the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, because it was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, naturally it had a different name, this <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">We lived on the side where it said Listopadova (ph) and the number on the <span class="DLF">street</span> was 17.</sentence><sentence id="30">Upstairs we lived the business together.</sentence><sentence id="31">There was a lot of that in Europe -- people had combined things.</sentence><sentence id="32">Downstairs my grandmother had for a long time a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>, but in the later years she retired and naturally she came to live with us, with Grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="33">But Grandfather died before the war, and I think he was fortunate enough, the only one to die a natural death from the immediate family.</sentence><sentence id="34">I have a sister, which survived.</sentence><sentence id="35">I had two brothers, a mother, and my grandmother lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="36">1 was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the year of 1939 -- I was not quite 13 years old, but I was through with <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, all the grades.</sentence><sentence id="37">I had skipped some classes, this is why I finished early.</sentence><sentence id="38">So that was the time of vacation in between.</sentence><sentence id="39">My parents tried to decide what would I go into.</sentence><sentence id="40">We were very Orthodox, very religious.</sentence><sentence id="41">My father was one of the Hasidim -- belonged to one of the Hasidic sects, it was called the Alexander Hasidim (ph).</sentence><sentence id="42">So, he did not want me to continue.</sentence><sentence id="43">Their <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, which was called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, was also a paid school.</sentence><sentence id="44">You did not get that free.</sentence><sentence id="45">It was a higher school of learning, and naturally we didn't have one in the beginning, and because we were so religious and so sheltered my father wasn't going to let me go in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to continue this education.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, what should I be doing, right?</sentence><sentence id="47">First my mother thought maybe I should be a dressmaker.</sentence><sentence id="48">I said not on your life, because you know how the apprenticeship in Europe was for a dressmaker girl?</sentence><sentence id="49">First, you were bound for so many years there, and the first couple years all you did is to clean her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">She never showed you anything.</sentence><sentence id="51">You had to pass this test, you know, but I had a friend that owned one of those web whete -- textile, web, I don't understand how you say this machine that they made material, <span class="BUILDING">textile mills</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span>, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="96">They did that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">The textile industry was very prominent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and that spilled over to our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because we were about only 14 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">Almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">I used to go and visit her and watch her, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she was doing all this and I thought it was fascinating.</sentence><sentence id="100">In the same <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span>, the owner was Jewish and she said, "Oh he takes apprentice girls if you want to learn this trade."</sentence><sentence id="101">So, I don't know how I persuaded my father to let me do it, because he didn't think something like that I should go work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, after all, but I said," Iam not going to go there."</sentence><sentence id="102">Here if he takes me in, even at the age of 13, there were no labor laws over there, so you could earn money if you wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="103">So, these couple months until the war came out I learned and I worked there for a while.</sentence><sentence id="104">I was happy because I got paid for it and I felt very important.</sentence><sentence id="105">Also, because I didn't continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we did sort of at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> learn some mote.</sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know what kind of education my father had, but he was so wise and he knew so many things that I really don't know where he learned all this.</sentence><sentence id="107">So, we just kept on learning from them.</sentence><sentence id="108">We also had a habit of reading a lot.</sentence><sentence id="109">Then my father was busy working and had no time to read the newspapers, my mother would sit next to him and read him aloud the newspapers and I remember her chuckling about when the world news in this paper about certain things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">And that's what we would call the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and she shook her and used to say, "Only in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> things like that can happen."</sentence><sentence id="111">It was something unbelievable whatever it was I can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="112">Anyway, she was marveling at the things that were happening here, even at that time.</sentence><sentence id="113">So, like I said, I was sheltered.</sentence><sentence id="114">I was happy.</sentence><sentence id="115">Until this fatal day when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Just let me ask you one question.</sentence><sentence id="138">When you were reading in the newspapers were you reading about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Yes, we did.</sentence><sentence id="142">My mother used to read and she used to be very stressed about it.</sentence><sentence id="143">Refugees, people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Jewish people, came through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and I remember that she was collecting, going around and collecting clothes for them and other things.</sentence><sentence id="144">We donated a lot of things to them.</sentence><sentence id="145">My mother could not get over it because when she was a girl going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, quite young, the part where we lived was once Russian and once Austrian or Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="146">I guess she was in <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="147">Anyway, then she lived downstairs with my grandparents of course.</sentence><sentence id="148">After she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she used to hang around the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and the Germans that came into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, they were so polite, and she says, "I was a little girl and they came in they greeted me, and kissed my hand, and called me Fraulein Marta."</sentence><sentence id="149">That was her name, and she said, "I can't understand that those should be the same people, and that they would get so insane and follow a man, an evil man like him."</sentence><sentence id="150">It was unbelievable, and what we counted on is for the world to stop him.</sentence><sentence id="151">But it didn't happen, we know that.</sentence><sentence id="152">Just it seems like to her unbelievable that nobody stood up against him and let him get away with whatever he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: So, you were starting to tell me how things changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, there was a battle a little whiles away from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233333" long="19.366666">Kutno</span> (ph).Soldiers, German soldiers were marching through there.</sentence><sentence id="169">And while they were marching through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they used to stop and do some looting and rounding also.</sentence><sentence id="170">Because it was so close and shrapnels were falling in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, we all took shelter in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the back.</sentence><sentence id="171">There was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> before the war, a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span>, so all the neighbors gathered and we slept in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">We made sort of an improvised bedding, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> was there.</sentence><sentence id="173">We brought our food and we slept there, but when the soldiers were matching through and trying to loot the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, some of the Polish people pointed out where we were and made us go out there and they just took whatever they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="174">To the end, there was nothing left to take, so the last soldiers that came up in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and couldn't find anything, you know what they took?</sentence><sentence id="175">My father had all these accessories for fixing watches and people broke the glass on top.</sentence><sentence id="176">He fixed, he put all different kinds of shapes of glass for all different watches.</sentence><sentence id="177">They picked up handfuls and put in their pockets.</sentence><sentence id="178">Just the glass, would you believe that?</sentence><sentence id="179">We just shook our heads and didn't know what are they going to do with this.</sentence><sentence id="180">The battle lasted there for a few days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: This was when?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: 1939.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: September?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="203">They entered our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to stay -- I think what -- I don't remember the day, but according to the paper I got from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, it was supposed to have been September 5.</sentence><sentence id="204">I know they came in real early.</sentence><sentence id="205">The first day, 25 Jews were shot right there, on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I don't know how they could know these people were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="207">I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="208">I wasn't on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">I just know that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="210">So, you see, there was panic.</sentence><sentence id="211">Everybody run, hiding in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">We just sit there not knowing what would happen.</sentence><sentence id="213">And then again, they came into your <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and then they took household goods.</sentence><sentence id="214">Pillows, pictures if you had anything of value, whatever they thought they wanted, they took.</sentence><sentence id="215"><span class="BUILDING">Businesses</span> were taken over, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="216">On our <span class="DLF">street</span>, there were quiet a few enterprises, there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="217">On the left side we had a family that run a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where you bought material and made clothes, coats and clothes.</sentence><sentence id="218">Then the lady that took over my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, she had a little <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">Next to it was a tinsmith, like he was fixing pots and pans and all that.</sentence><sentence id="220">Then was another large family that was selling pots, and pans, and sweaters, all kinds of glassware.</sentence><sentence id="221">Like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they have the <span class="BUILDING">Pottery Barn</span>, and it was something like that, on a small scale.</sentence><sentence id="222">Farther down you had other <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there were <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">There were all kinds of little enterprises and everybody made a living because it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">There was a couple <span class="BUILDING">textile factories</span> and the rest of the population made a nice living, so that was it.</sentence><sentence id="226">But all of this had stopped.</sentence><sentence id="227">They took over <span class="BUILDING">city halls</span> naturally, the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="228">And from then on the orders came.</sentence><sentence id="229">Right away, the first days Jews were beaten on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, wherever you showed up.</sentence><sentence id="230">Our two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned down.</sentence><sentence id="231">The rest of the <span class="DLF">walls</span> that remained standing the Jewish people were forced to dismantle.</sentence><sentence id="232">That's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="233">There's not a sign left in the city of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">Nothing to remind you if you didn't know they were there.</sentence><sentence id="235">So, you see life was hard.</sentence><sentence id="236">Then all the rules came out.</sentence><sentence id="237">We could not enter any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">We still lived where we did originally when the war started, but we could not enter any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> to buy any provisions.</sentence><sentence id="239">We were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>, only on the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">Later on, the arm bands came with the yellow stars.</sentence><sentence id="241">We had to form, like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a Jewish administration.</sentence><sentence id="242">And they had to follow orders.</sentence><sentence id="243">The orders came to them, they had to carry them out.</sentence><sentence id="244">Otherwise they come in and did twice as much damage as originally they wanted, whatever they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="245">So, it was hard.</sentence><sentence id="246">Right away they demanded so many young men, single men, supposedly for labor into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">But we knew later on that it wasn't so.</sentence><sentence id="248">These people send us one time a post card that they were well and we should send them food.</sentence><sentence id="249">People did, but you know they never received and these people never survived the first couple days, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="250">I think they did exterminate them right away, these first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">That's what we were told.</sentence><sentence id="252">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="253">Some of them probably went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">Like my husband, when he was grabbed on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">He said, "I built some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>."</sentence><sentence id="256">He said, "I helped them put the <span class="DLF">walls</span> up," so you see, some of them probably went that way and didn't survive or whatever happened.</sentence><sentence id="257">Anyway life was hard, we did not have enough access to medication, to real food that we needed.</sentence><sentence id="258">So, you see older people, babies, sick people died, lack of medication, lack of facilities too or lack of food.</sentence><sentence id="259">The first victims tight away, and quite a few every day, quite a few.</sentence><sentence id="260">It was hard.</sentence><sentence id="261">Then if you walked down the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, they grabbed you off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and made you clean the <span class="DLF">roads</span> or whatever, beating the people, making fun of them.</sentence><sentence id="262">Some of the religious people, the Hasidic people they caught.</sentence><sentence id="263">Like in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> they made them wear the prayer shawls, and run back and forth, and cut their beards off.</sentence><sentence id="264">It was their favorite pasttime in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did this happen to your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: No, it did not happen to my father.</sentence><sentence id="331">My father, actually had a small beard, very neat trimmed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="332">But we -- my father ended up to be almost the only one in his trade in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and so from the beginning on we were forced to work for them.</sentence><sentence id="333">The local people pointed out that he was the craftsman.</sentence><sentence id="334">They came in and brought all their watches to repair and of coutse the gold they robbed from whoever they found.</sentence><sentence id="335">My father had to fashion other jewelry for them which they sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">Some of them not even said thank you but some of them surprisingly brought some provisions, some food, which we appreciated very much but you couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="337">You were afraid to say anything.</sentence><sentence id="338">You were grateful for whatever you got, no matter which <span class="NPIP">source</span> it came.</sentence><sentence id="339">It was hard to live and we were growing children and denied everything right away.</sentence><sentence id="340">It just didn't do good for our health and for our morals, because of this and trying to figure out what was going on, it was confusing.</sentence><sentence id="341">We just lived from day to day, not knowing what the next day will bring.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Was there any sense of normalcy?</sentence><sentence id="355">Did you have friends, did you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: I had friends as long as we could, we did communicate with one another.</sentence><sentence id="357">But it was more dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="358">You were afraid to go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">Sometimes they just picked you off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and you disappeared not knowing where you went.</sentence><sentence id="360">So, it was dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="361">Most people stayed close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">They also liquidated the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">There were a lot of Jewish books in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, so at the time of liquidation whoever was close grabbed a few books and they just made a circle around the people.</sentence><sentence id="364">I remember quite a few of them finding their way into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">We used to read them in the evenings where we had to cover the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that the light shouldn't be visible <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">We used to sit -- that was the only thing you could do is talk and read.</sentence><sentence id="367">You could not observe any holidays any more.</sentence><sentence id="368">In your own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> if possibly, you could get away with it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="369">My father still prayed every morning and he went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> real early in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="370">We were hoping nobody would come to see that, but he observed as long as he could possibly the circumstances let him do that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Were you ever subject to any punishment or did you see any beatings or hangings or any sort of that brutal treatment?</sentence></p></dialogue>

prisoner, "Hey, what is this <span class="NPIP">place</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1243">Where did we come to?"</sentence><sentence id="1244">He said, "You're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1245">Okay, we knew of atrocities but the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1246">It didn't ring a bell.</sentence><sentence id="1247">We didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was all about.</sentence><sentence id="1248">Looking forward to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to walk in, we saw the sign, the famous sign that said in German Arbeit Macht Frei, English, work makes you free.</sentence><sentence id="1249">Big joke.</sentence><sentence id="1250">My father, my two brothers on the other <span class="NPIP">side in</span> the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1251">My mother, my sister and I in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and two more people.</sentence><sentence id="1252">Always in five.</sentence><sentence id="1253">That was their military thing, lining up in five.</sentence><sentence id="1254">Moving forward and my brother was on one end on the edge and I was on the other looking over to him.</sentence><sentence id="1255">He said to me, "Why do you just hold the bread?</sentence><sentence id="1256">Eat some of it.</sentence><sentence id="1257">You need your strength.</sentence><sentence id="1258">We're only going to <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and we'll meet again."</sentence><sentence id="1259">I still didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1260">I looked at him, and that was the last 8 time I saw him.</sentence><sentence id="1261">I never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="1262">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="1263">So, anyway, we moved forward.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Finally we came in front of these S.S. with their canes, sort of like batons pointing to the left, to the right.</sentence><sentence id="1265">My mother was in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="1266">She was dragged out right away.</sentence><sentence id="1267">I still remember what she was wearing.</sentence><sentence id="1268">A beige sweater and a blue dress with little flowers.</sentence><sentence id="1269">She looked back, but we could do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1270">He dragged her out and pointed to the left.</sentence><sentence id="1271">My sister was told to go to the right.</sentence><sentence id="1272">When I stepped forward he looked at me hesitating, saying in German, "How old are your" I could not speak I was so stunned.</sentence><sentence id="1273">I couldn't -- it didn't register what was going on here, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="1274">I couldn't figure out what was going on here.</sentence><sentence id="1275">So my sister standing on the side said, "Oh she's old enough.</sentence><sentence id="1276">She can work.</sentence><sentence id="1277">She's strong."</sentence><sentence id="1278">I don't know why she said that.</sentence><sentence id="1279">We didn't know which <span class="NPIP">side</span> is good which <span class="NPIP">side</span> is bad.</sentence><sentence id="1280">She just said that by instinct, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1281">So, he stood hesitated and pushed me towards her.</sentence><sentence id="1282">Over there again, we had to line up moving forward closer towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1283">Before we entered we had -- walking farther down the <span class="DLF">line</span> we wete told to strip naked and this on <span class="DLF">line</span> always in five they looked us over again, anyone that had a birth mark or a scar from surgery or some women if they were middle age that survived the first selection and had some wrinkles on their body, were also taken out of this <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1284">From then, before they took us into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, they shaved the hair on our bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Every <span class="NPIP">place</span> a person has hair has been shaved.</sentence><sentence id="1286">It was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1287">My sister was standing next to me and I didn't really know who she was.</sentence><sentence id="1288">It was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1289">We had to call out to each other to realize who we were.</sentence><sentence id="1290">Then in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower stalls</span>, so-called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower stalls</span>, a couple drips of water came down, running to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> each one of us were given a dress.</sentence><sentence id="1291">And what they did usually, on purpose, as the tall persons got a small dress and a small person like me got a huge dress.</sentence><sentence id="1292">There was a problem which we did ourselves adjust exchanging the clothes between ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1293">From there they lined us up again of course in five, marched into an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and told to sit down.</sentence><sentence id="1294">We wete surrounded and guarded by women, hardened criminals that were there I think for a couple of years, and they were the so-called kapos.</sentence><sentence id="1295">And they had canes, walking around with these canes and making sure we sit in an orderly <span class="DLF">line</span> of five on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, on the bare ground there in an open <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1296">Well, the ait was heavy there , but seeing so many people, we thought maybe it comes from some kind of an industry.</sentence><sentence id="1297">There are so many people, someone must be doing some work.</sentence><sentence id="1298">So, this is what we always thought, but they straightened us out.</sentence><sentence id="1299">Trying to move to warm ourselves one and another's bodies because it was a very raw day, windy, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is not so far away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpethian Mountains</span> so the <span class="DLF">air</span> is always sharper.</sentence><sentence id="1300">We were called.</sentence><sentence id="1301">They screamed at us and called us a bunch of cattle, pointing out to those big <span class="DLF">chimneys</span>, that smoke, black smoke was belching out of there and saying, "You're not worth anything anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1302">Tomorrow this is what's going to left of you.</sentence><sentence id="1303">Look up there, you see this?</sentence><sentence id="1304">This is what is going to be left of you."</sentence><sentence id="1305">So you can imagine how we felt, but still somehow, it didn't penetrate.</sentence><sentence id="1306">We didn't really and truly realize in what kind of a situation we were.</sentence><sentence id="1307">We were numb.</sentence><sentence id="1308">Dehumanized there already at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1309">So, we just sat there.</sentence><sentence id="1310">Somehow it didn't happen that way.</sentence><sentence id="1311">In the morning, they lined us up and marched into a <span

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1483">Ag No.</sentence><sentence id="1484">I don't know if it's true, but after the war, the assumption was that the end of 1944 they were bringing in people for extermination at such rate that the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> could not accommodate them.</sentence><sentence id="1485">You see, we were marked strictly for extermination because we did not get any tattoos anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1486">That was the thing.</sentence><sentence id="1487">So, people were just sitting piled up waiting their turn and this is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1488">We were just sitting in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> like waiting out turn to be exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="1489">And somehow one morning at the tzail-a-pelle they took this whole group of 500 women from this <span class="DLF">block</span>, drove us into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, gave us some mote clothes, some wooden shoes, underwear different dress, a little portion of bread and again into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1490">There were less of us in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, we had more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> for our needs.</sentence><sentence id="1491">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started moving again.</sentence><sentence id="1492">A couple <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> I remember they stopped opened up this <span class="DLF">door</span> and the S.S. man that guarded us told us we could empty that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span>, so we figured that's better treatment than what we had before.</sentence><sentence id="1493">We traveled several hours and final destination we ended up in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, but our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we dwelled was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tzazel</span> (ph) and the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where we traveled into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for work was called 0 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popinville</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence

to pick up the ration of bread for the whole day.</sentence><sentence id="1499">I remember we were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teal</span> -- I and my sister found ourselves in a real small <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1500">There were about 15 women only there, which was very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1501">It was unusual, so we took turns.</sentence><sentence id="1502">Every day another woman went out and brought the bread which we divided by some miracle we found a string.</sentence><sentence id="1503">We had to see that it was the same so we made a measure out of that string and cut the bread accordingly so each one had the same amount.</sentence><sentence id="1504">Coffee, they gave us something warm to drink, the so-called coffee.</sentence><sentence id="1505">It was slop, but we didn't have any other utensil except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> that we used during the night for our needs because there was a curfew after a certain time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we could not even go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1506">So, whoever's turn it was to go get the provision, emptied the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span>, swished it out with cold water and this is where we brought the coffee.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And this is what we did drink from.</sentence><sentence id="1508">You can imagine how dehumanized we were.</sentence><sentence id="1509">It didn't matter where this stuff came from, as long as you could keep warm, as long as you could fill your stomach.</sentence><sentence id="1510">That's what it mattered.</sentence><sentence id="1511">The conditions were a little better in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1512">On the weekend, on Sundays we could wash our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1513">Naturally we had nothing else, so we walked around in our coats, the so-called coats they gave us, our underwear and dress were washed and hung out of in winter by that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> that we had and dried it out and if it didn't dry in winter good enough by the time we had to put it on, we had to put it on the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="1514">It just dried up on you.</sentence><sentence id="1515">Wooden shoes, every morning we wete divided into groups, certain people stayed right there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">T'zazel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1516">They were marched to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popinville</span> and they were digging <span class="DLF">foundations</span> for little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> they built for people that were bombed out in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1517">But it seems like I was always the unfortunate one traveling into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and my job was cleaning the rubble from the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, from the bombs that destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">We had to clean up the rubble on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, put it in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrows</span> and push it into a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1519">That was the beginning of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1520">At that time already when the Allies started bombing day and night, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was an important harbor city, so their aim was to destroy anything that was of importance to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1521">Three, four times, even sometimes five times a day they came.</sentence><sentence id="1522">We worked in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called in German the Heileche-gaistvelt (ph), and it was a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span> right next to us.</sentence><sentence id="1523">Everytime you could hear the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> up there, that radar turning and beeping, we knew that the Allies were coming to bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1524">And it was funny, when the first alarm sounded for the Germans to take cover, the population, we watched them run with their suitcases and their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and their children and a great panic trying to hide before this disaster.</sentence><sentence id="1525">We looked at one another and we were laughing because this did not represent this big superman race.</sentence><sentence id="1526">They were scared.</sentence><sentence id="1527">They were just like you and I. They were afraid to die, you know, so and now finally they came to the realization that Hitler cannot save them in any other way.</sentence><sentence id="1528">It gave us great satisfaction.</sentence><sentence id="1529">The only thing we didn't know if you ever live to see.</sentence><sentence id="1530">We knew that Hitler was losing the war.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Seeing the situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, we knew he could not win this war, but if he ever would be alive to see that, that was a big question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
