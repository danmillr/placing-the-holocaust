<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: Then your goal was to be this quintessential All -- American guy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Yes that's right.</sentence><sentence id="71">I wanted to be the uh as good as I possibly could be in sports and also be a good student, because Frank Merrywell was a good student.</sentence><sentence id="72">I, 1 wound up being, I would say, uh a B student.</sentence><sentence id="73">Uh I never had problems passing a, a courses in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">I was uh a fair student.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: After you read that did you think ah ha maybe that is where I'm going or is that something I should aspire to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: I didn't think in terms of the Olympic games until I was uh well into my uh freshman year at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">Uh I was a, a school boy champion as a sprinter.</sentence><sentence id="113">I was the, the city champion, the state champion, the national sprint champion, but I didn't think in terms of the in terms of the Olympic games because I, I was still a kid.</sentence><sentence id="114">Iwas 17.</sentence><sentence id="115">And uh only in my freshman year when I began to win against important competition did I realize I had a chance to make the team.</sentence><sentence id="116">And when I won the metropolitan championships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and then the Eastern Olympic trials up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> against a great sprinter named Ben Johnson.</sentence><sentence id="117">When I beat Ben he was uh, uh, he was uh the world's record holder at 60 yards indoors, and when I beat him I realized then just a, a month before the Olympic games that I had a chance to make the Olympic team.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: I'm going to ask you to repeat one sentence.</sentence><sentence id="126">Not the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="127">When you said something about not until I was in my freshman year.</sentence><sentence id="128">Can you say not until I was in my freshman year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Not only my freshman year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> did I realize that I had a chance to make the Olympic team?</sentence><sentence id="134">I was uh a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> champion, New York City sprint champion for several years, and New York State champion.</sentence><sentence id="135">I was also the national interscholastic schoolboy champion.</sentence><sentence id="136">I and I knew I could run fast, but I didn't know how fast I ran until I ran against uh some of the better sprinters in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and was able to beat them, particularly a fellow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> named Ben Johnson, an outstanding sprinter.</sentence><sentence id="137">He was the world's record holder at 60 yards indoors and when I beat Ben, beat him a couple of times, I realized I had a shot for the Olympic team and that was at the end of my freshman year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about being a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: In my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> years and my <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> years, there was nothing different about being a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> athlete certainly not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">I'd competed against everyone.</sentence><sentence id="147">And uh I felt no different than other athletes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">It was only in my uh freshman year at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> that I became aware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">training table</span> meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please pass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, because they weren't lamb chops.</sentence><sentence id="149">They were pork chops.</sentence><sentence id="150">So I realized then I was a little bit different than most of the other guys on the football squad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Did it motivate you differently?</sentence><sentence id="164">Did you think about it differently when you competed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: I was always aware of the fact that I'm a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="168">Uh never unaware of it under virtually all circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="169">And uh even in uh the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> competitions and certainly at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and uh for the Olympic team I wanted to show that uh a Jew could do just as well as any other individual no matter what his race, creed or color and perhaps even better.</sentence><sentence id="170">And uh it wasn't until uh the, the circumstances developed in the Olympic games when I was refused the opportunity to run in the games uh because of the fact I'm Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: At this time you're a little bit older, you're a little bit smarter about what's going on in the rest of the world, were you more aware of the restrictions applied to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="176">I mean in your, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> growing up it was very mixed.</sentence><sentence id="177">It didn't seem to be an issue.</sentence><sentence id="178">But were you aware that there was anti -- Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, that you couldn't go everywhere you wanted to and that sort of thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: I was certainly aware of the fact that there was anti-- Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="184">My grandfather and my father, my uncles, told me about the pogroms in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">They'd heard about the pogroms in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as well and in other parts of Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and I was aware of uh anti-- Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="186">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> I was also aware of the fact that there were certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> I was not welcome.</sentence><sentence id="187">I might go into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which read restricted clientele, which meant in effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed.</sentence><sentence id="188">There were certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> where you couldn't live.</sentence><sentence id="189">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darian</span>, <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>, for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darian</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">And uh I was aware of that.</sentence><sentence id="191">Uh my folks would tell me and my in -- laws later on uh told me about reservations they made at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and my father -- in -- law's name was Dorman and uh neither Jewish or Gentile, and he would try to check into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> having made a reservation at some <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> and being turned away when they found out he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="192">He might check in as Jack Dorman, which he was, but his friends and associates might have names like Goldberg or Cohen or Goldstein and the group was turned away uh upon occasion.</sentence><sentence id="193">So I was aware.</sentence><sentence id="194">I was aware of anti-- Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="195">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="369">I guess I'm asking was there something that happened there, that was a precursor of anything else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell leads to another story which has to do with the selection uh my ouster from the team.</sentence><sentence id="373">So uh if you can fit this in.</sentence><sentence id="374">As we finished the race, I noted that Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach of the American Olympic team and the head track coach of the University of Southern California, was in amongst the officials, arguing with them that Frank Wycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper had finished fourth.</sentence><sentence id="375">Because he was the coach of <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span> and Wycoff and Draper ran for <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span> or had 7</sentence><sentence id="377">8 run.</sentence><sentence id="378">Wycoff was graduated.</sentence><sentence id="379">Had run for <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="380">These were his boys and he pushed them amongst the officials uh as finishing third and fourth.</sentence><sentence id="381">And I was placed fifth.</sentence><sentence id="382">I don't know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth.</sentence><sentence id="383">I just don't know.</sentence><sentence id="384">But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the order of finish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: And you think it was clearly favoritism, not the fact that you were a Jew?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: I think it was clearly favoritism that uh he wanted his boys placed third and fourth.</sentence><sentence id="402">Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time.</sentence><sentence id="403">He wanted his boys in there.</sentence><sentence id="404">And uh I had made the team anyhow because the first seven men were to make the team.</sentence><sentence id="405">The first three finishers running the 100 meter run, and the next four finishers making up the 400 meter relay.</sentence><sentence id="406">So I had made the team.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: We'll get to that.</sentence><sentence id="432">Now after you qualified for the Olympic team, what sort of preparation was there between those qualifying rounds at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall's Island</span> and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
