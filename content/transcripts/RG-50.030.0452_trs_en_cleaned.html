<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: No, we did not hear.</sentence><sentence id="125">We were pretty ignorant.</sentence><sentence id="126">We never felt anything.</sentence><sentence id="127">When the Italians came, they sent two groups of officers -- Italian military -- at some point in time.</sentence><sentence id="128">But we never felt anything because the Italians always behaved very well toward us.</sentence><sentence id="129">I said before that we were not supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when the racial laws started, but the Italians were very apologetic to us.</sentence><sentence id="130">They told us that those were the rules that they had received and unfortunately they had to apply them at some point in time.</sentence><sentence id="131">Not at the beginning, but at some point they were obliged to.</sentence><sentence id="132">And also some of the Jews belonged to clubs -- you know, an Italian circle of clubs, and we were excluded from them at that time also.</sentence><sentence id="133">But the Italians were again apologetic about that.</sentence><sentence id="134">They said they were obliged to do it because of some rules they had received from the mainland.</sentence><sentence id="135">Generally, we had normal life even after racial laws.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: What year did the racial laws go into effect in your <span class="REGION">area</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: At the beginning the racial laws were-- besides not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the club -- being excluded from the club--- the attitude between the Italian officers and the Jewish population was the same, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and the group was very small, so everybody knew everybody.</sentence><sentence id="151">And the Italian behavior stayed the same.</sentence><sentence id="152">It's only after the attempt on Hitler's life, that things got tougher because of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="153">That was on July 20, 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: I think I forgot my question.</sentence><sentence id="159">I think I understand that it wasn't a drastic change of lifestyle when the racial laws were implemented.</sentence><sentence id="160">However, I'm wondering if you and your family, or others in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> were talking about this and very concerned about this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: We had news, in some of the Italian newspapers, but since it was so far away, we thought, you know, we were not concerned.</sentence><sentence id="165">We were very isolated in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and even the attitude of the Italian officers was very relaxed, so we wouldn't think that something was really happening to us.</sentence><sentence id="166">That's why we were not as concerned.</sentence><sentence id="167">The situation worsened when Badoglio, who was marshal in the Italian army, and the king, Vittorio Emmanuel the Third, when they asked for the armistice with the Allies.</sentence><sentence id="168">And at that time, things got a little tougher.</sentence><sentence id="171">At that time, when the Germans saw that the Italians were asking for the armistice and they got it, they felt they were betrayed by the Italians.</sentence><sentence id="172">At that point in time, they sent some troops to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">It was only nine months before our eventual deportation that at some point in time the Germans, after seeing what the Italians did, sent more troops to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">But the local population was not aware of anything, and even the Germans that were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> were acting very normal and polite with all the population.</sentence><sentence id="175">We did not know, but in the meantime, they had taken all the information on Jewish families.</sentence><sentence id="176">They took all the addresses and knew who was living where and they already had all the information on Jews.</sentence><sentence id="177">They were not showing anything, but they had already started.</sentence><sentence id="178">German troops came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span> on September 8, 1943.At some point, after the armistice, the Germans had their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And at that point, they called all the Italian officers and told them, "Your king and the Marshal Badoglio have asked for armistice, so what are you going to do?"</sentence><sentence id="180">And at that point, the Germans told the Italian officers that they were German prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="181">But the officers stayed on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">They were not supposed to leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>, but they were not put as a military officer in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, they were just free to stay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="183">Therefore, the Jews were registered, but we knew nothing about what was going on in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="184">At the moment of the armistice, when the British saw that the Italians were joining the Allies, they tried to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">But the Germans had sent some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span> to bomb them.</sentence><sentence id="186">And then the British tried to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span>, but they couldn't succeed, so they had to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="187">And so we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="188">And the Jewish population and the rest of the population stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">The Italians didn't say anything and maybe didn't know anything about the plans of the Germans, but at some point, the Germans that were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> of course, told the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> that if they wanted to leave, they could leave.</sentence><sentence id="190">This was because we were going to run out of food because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> was kind of isolated.</sentence><sentence id="191">It was surrounded by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British submarines</span>, and we had difficulty finding food.</sentence><sentence id="192">So they had asked the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> if any of us wanted to leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Did you or your family express interest in leaving?</sentence><sentence id="225">Did you know people personally -- people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> -- who were leaving?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: My father said leaving was not necessary.</sentence><sentence id="229">He thought the war would end soon.</sentence><sentence id="230">Maybe a couple of people left the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: At this point, before you were deported of course, is there any stage where you were really starting to feel fear?</sentence><sentence id="235">You or your family?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: We had no fear because we had, at some point... The British had bombed a few times, but we were not afraid because we were thinking that the war was about to end.</sentence><sentence id="237">So we said it's not the time to be afraid, and we are far away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Did you hear about the war in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> -- in Europe for instance?</sentence><sentence id="241">Did you even... When did you know that the war had started -- in September of 1939?</sentence><sentence id="242">When did you learn about those events?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: We were not aware, because in a certain way, we knew about the war, but we were not very concerned.</sentence><sentence id="247">And then, unfortunately, I feel bad about the ignorance, but we had no more radios, but more than that-- that was not an excuse, but more than that it's because we saw the Italians around us who were not concerned, so we didn't know why we would be concerned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: I wanted to ask a little bit more about the racial laws and to get a little more detail on what you recall you had to do differently because of the laws.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The Italians never made us feel that there was a difference.</sentence><sentence id="253">We thought that we had to stop going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of the war and that's how it was.</sentence><sentence id="254">We thought we'd be able to go back after the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="255">Tape 1, Side B</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: We were last talking about the racial laws and I want to make sure we have the chronology of events correct.</sentence><sentence id="261">So I want to establish exactly when it was when you no longer could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We could no longer go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after 1938.</sentence><sentence id="265">I had done quite a bit of <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span>, so it was not hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="266">But small children had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What exactly did you do every day after you no longer were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the family.</sentence><sentence id="273">I was still going to take piano lessons because I had started at the <span class="BUILDING">nun's school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">I started when I was three years old and kept on taking piano lessons with the sister who was giving piano lessons.</sentence><sentence id="275">The sister wanted me also to help out with other small children and give them some lessons in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">These were not Jewish children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And then we were also talking about the possibility for people to leave the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">Could we establish exactly when you learned about this in relationship to the racial laws and other events?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: We were not-- The Germans were not treating us the way they treated Jews in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="293">We didn't have to wear the star; we didn't have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">And the Germans would come to my <span class="BUILDING">father's store</span>, buy merchandise, pay and be well-behaved.</sentence><sentence id="295">They were not aggressive to us.</sentence><sentence id="296">At one point, one of my father's employees said, "Since we have this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that we use to do commerce in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>, why don't we put all our merchandise and things out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="297">The employee had asked also that my only brother that remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span> -- not the ones who had left, but the only remaining brother, the youngest one -- he would go with this boat captain to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and establish maybe a business on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, or start a life on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">This was winter 1943-44.</sentence><sentence id="299"><span class="COUNTRY">Kos</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> was only 4 km.</sentence><sentence id="300">But my father said, "No, the war will end soon."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: At the time of this event of mentioning your brother and this German, was he actually a soldier?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="303">He was not a German; he was a Greek captain who was working for my father in February or March of 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: And how old were you about this time and how active are you in any of the decision making in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: I was 22-23 years old.</sentence><sentence id="309">I had no special role in the family's decisions.</sentence><sentence id="310">My father decided.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Did the sisters talk to you about the problems?</sentence><sentence id="315">Did they give you advice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: The nuns did not know.</sentence><sentence id="319">The sisters of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had no idea about what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="320">It was only at the moment of the deportation when the Germans arrested us, that one of the sisters in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the Mother Superior, came and said to the Germans that my mother was sick and was not very well and if she could stay because she had to get treatment and then they would send her afterward.</sentence><sentence id="321">But she was thinking of sending my mother to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> instead.</sentence><sentence id="322">But my mother did not agree to stay behind...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Did they tell your father what to do?</sentence><sentence id="329">What role did your mother have in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Although she was Jewish, my mother worked with the Mother Superior sometimes, collecting money and doing charity work.</sentence><sentence id="333">And she went around with the Mother Superior since my mother spoke Greek and also spoke Italian, Spanish and Turkish.</sentence><sentence id="334">She was going around to collect funds for the children attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- they were basically Turkish and Greek poor children who</sentence><sentence id="336">didn't have much and didn't have shoes sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="337">And so my mother was doing charity work for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to that effect.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: The food shortage was worse at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span>, and moreso in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">It was not so bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> (1942-43), since it was a small community and we knew (and were friends with) farmers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Did you hear much about what was happening on the mainland of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>?</sentence><sentence id="355">Specifically, I believe there were other deportations of Jews in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="356">Did you hear anything about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: I want to go back just for a moment, because some of the reading I had done, I had seen something about actually this is not during the war but back to 1933, something about there being an earthquake on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and actually the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> being destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="365">I was wondering if that affected you or your family of if you remember if this is right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="777">Q: I wanted to address the specific date because there are actually a few things that I've read, some people who I think were also from the same <span class="REGION">region</span>, who said that they arrived on August 17", and I just wanted to make sure and maybe you have some reason for how that might have come about , this discrepancy.</sentence><sentence id="778">Why, it seems like I've seen some things that say August 16" and some that say August 17".</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="797">Q: When did you actually realize that your other family members had been killed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="799">A: At the beginning, when we didn't really know -- at some point in time, the people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the (?)</sentence><sentence id="800">people, the ones that were directing the other prisoners, were telling us (2) these are flames, these are-- We kind of understood they were... At the beginning, we thought that the smell we were smelling was the Germans cooking food for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="801">It was</sentence><sentence id="803">like a meat smell... that there was food.</sentence><sentence id="804">And then we found out that it was not, but at no point in time did we want to either know or-- or-- or be sure that the parents, and the others who were not there, were actually being burned.</sentence><sentence id="805">And we sometimes had the feeling that maybe-- maybe they were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">And there was a lady from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> that had four children, between 4 and 10 years old.</sentence><sentence id="807">Four beautiful kids.</sentence><sentence id="808">And she had asked once, "Where do you think my children are?</sentence><sentence id="809">Are they somewhere else, or did they actually kill them?"</sentence><sentence id="810">And the answer was, "Oh no, I'm sure they are somewhere else."</sentence><sentence id="811">But actually, when we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the same night, those kids were with their grandmother -- I mean this woman's mother -- and they were together with the grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="812">They took them, so we never really knew what happened to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, we found some-- at some point we heard-- Some people heard us speaking in Italian, French, and Spanish, so they came over, and they asked, "Where are you from?</sentence><sentence id="841">We speak French; are you from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="842">And then we said, "No, we come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="36.433" long="28.217">Rhodes</span>."</sentence><sentence id="843">And the other ones say, "We come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonique</span> (<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaloniki</span>)."</sentence><sentence id="844">And there were people, like some women, who'd been there two years already.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="874">Q: So, did you mostly have contact with other Greek Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="876">A: There were a small number of Greek Jews.</sentence><sentence id="877">Only three women who approached us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">Some were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: Did you ever know of any resistance activities that Greek Jews specifically were involved with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="884">A: It is possible that there was, but I didn't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: Did you then mostly have contact with other women prisoners, more than any men?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="888">A: We had no contact with men, we were always separated.</sentence><sentence id="889">Contact was prohibited.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="892">Q: Were you able to carry on any cultural or religious activities at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: We didn't do anything, but we were really amazed to see that there were some Ashkenazi women, who were there for maybe two or three years, and every Friday were taking a little bit of the margarine they were receiving, and they were melting it down and then tried to do a little candle, and light it, and they were crying.</sentence><sentence id="895">And every week, they were doing that and I was amazed that they were doing that.</sentence><sentence id="896">They were organized.</sentence><sentence id="897">And also in order to make some kind of a candle, they were ripping little threads from blankets and they were using that to do the candles.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: You never actually participated?</sentence><sentence id="903">You saw this but you weren't involved personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="906">A: Since the women had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a long time, the women had the habit of doing that.</sentence><sentence id="907">But for us, we admired them that even in those kind of moments, they were doing this.</sentence><sentence id="908">But we were overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="909">But we had a kind of admiration for them.</sentence><sentence id="910">The difference was that since the Ashkenazi people were more religious, they had lived mainly in Jewish circles.</sentence><sentence id="911">And they were coming either from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, and they had been living more in isolation, so they were in a closer society and they were used to being among all Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="912">The difference with the Sephardic Jews was that we were more integrated into the rest of the culture and population and various religions.</sentence><sentence id="913">So yes, they were Jewish and they were doing the traditional Jewish observance.</sentence><sentence id="914">But we were not as close to the religion as were these people coming from smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="915">And also because those Jewish people were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and were obliged to be isolated and interact only with each other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: So I'm not sure how you might be able to answer this if you weren't really seeing other men prisoners, but I'm interested in the differences between how women and men were treated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="933">I don't know if you have any perspective?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: The work that was given to men was a lot harder and more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="937">They were going to <span class="DLF">mines</span> and they would carry two great stones, so they had a much harder life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and also, of the survivors that came out of our group, most are women.</sentence><sentence id="938">There are maybe only five or six men of the 150 that survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: I think that I saw, or I think I remember in what you were saying before, something about contact you yourself had with SS or with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> or, you know, other, and I was wondering if there is anything else you didn't' say about your personal interaction with those people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: An extraordinary thing happened to me when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="945">I was working at the time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">There were four women in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span> and we were washing blankets from dead people or sick people and all the dirty clothes that were from the people who had died, also from diseases, with lice and with-- We were obliged to wash about 60 blankets a day.</sentence><sentence id="947">I was washing then.</sentence><sentence id="948">And at some point in time, there was an officer that came in with other SS and they had their handkerchiefs on their noses because the smell was unbearable in there.</sentence><sentence id="949">They said, "Keep washing and working.</sentence><sentence id="950">We are doing an inspection."</sentence><sentence id="951">And this officer, at some point in time, looked at me and asked in French, "Where are you coming from?"</sentence><sentence id="952">So I said, "I'm coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kos</span> and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>," because that's where I was coming from at the time.</sentence><sentence id="953">I was then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">And the officer asked, "Where are your parents?"</sentence><sentence id="955">And then I said, "They stayed in... they stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>."</sentence><sentence id="956">And then after that he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="957">No, he asked first, "What were you doing before?"</sentence><sentence id="958">And then I said, "Certainly not that."</sentence><sentence id="959">Then he looked at me and he said, "I can see from your hands," because I still had good hands at the time.</sentence><sentence id="960">Then he asked if I wanted to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="961">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work, because there was food and it was warm.</sentence><sentence id="962">So I said, "Oh, yes."</sentence><sentence id="963">Then he left.</sentence><sentence id="964">And that evening he sent a prisoner, a guy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, who came over and gave me a pack with sugar and salami and some margarine and bread and he said, "Don't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="965">This is the officer sending you that."</sentence><sentence id="966">And for a few days, every day he sent that with the prisoner and then at some point in time, the kitchen chief (an older political prisoner interned in 1933) came and said, "You come here.</sentence><sentence id="967">I received orders that you are to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>."</sentence><sentence id="968">And later on, I saw the officer.</sentence><sentence id="969">He was a doctor and he was working at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="970">I tried to smile to him, but he put a finger on his mouth and he kind of made a sign not to say a word about it.</sentence><sentence id="971">And so I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with my cousins Sara and Notrika and with another lady named Estela Levy.</sentence><sentence id="972">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was of course the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, but also, a few days after I left the laundry to begin working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, they closed the <span class="INT_SPACE">washing rooms</span> because all the women working there died.</sentence><sentence id="973">Some became crazy and the others got typhoid.</sentence><sentence id="974">They all died.</sentence><sentence id="975">So I was really lucky</sentence><sentence id="977">to have survived because I was saved by this officer, which is for me an amazing story.</sentence><sentence id="978">And that was the only contact I had directly.</sentence><sentence id="979">At some point in time, they closed the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because there were more and more bombings around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, because it was getting to the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="980">The Nazis were getting more and more scared, and there was hardly anything to eat because they couldn't get any food for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">And they were giving us a piece of bread for 18 people and the bread was usually half- molded because it was so old.</sentence><sentence id="982">And so one day they asked us to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to go pick up some potatoes in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> because ... There was no more food.</sentence><sentence id="983">It was raining steadily.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1026">Q: When did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span> and how did that come about, going from one to the other?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: At some point in time, they called us from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were and we had to go out and we had to be in <span class="DLF">line</span> without clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1029">And we had to pass in front of a medical team.</sentence><sentence id="1030">Among them was Mengele.</sentence><sentence id="1031">So we were very scared because there was another selection happening there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1032">And a woman that was in front of me, one girl that I knew, who had been burned when she was a little kid by oil in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she had a scar around the neck.</sentence><sentence id="1033">She was a beautiful woman, but she had just that one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1034">And they didn't know -- the Germans -- if it was an infection or something, so they put her on the side where the people were to be killed, because they thought it was a disease.</sentence><sentence id="1035">My cousins and I were still around the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at the time and I had taken a beet and I had looked for them in the <span class="DLF">block</span>, but in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bock</span> there was nobody anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1036">I got very scared, so I ran and I saw them in <span class="DLF">line</span> and I said, "Put the beet on your cheek, so you will look good, because we are passing in front of the doctor."</sentence><sentence id="1037">So that's what they did, and actually it was good for them because they looked so healthy, suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="1038">After that, they threw us another pack of clothes, and with that we went to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1039">That day of selection was October 26, 1944, and from there we went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we traveled for two days.</sentence><sentence id="1040">They most likely selected those who could still work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1041">We arrived in <span class="BUILDING">Klaffering station</span> and were divided into two groups: one to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and the other to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1042">At that point, they told us to pick up coats that had been thrown on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1043">They told us to put the coats on and then start walking.</sentence><sentence id="1044">It was night, and it was cold, so we put the coats on and started walking for the whole night.</sentence><sentence id="1045">And while we were walking, we were kind of feeling like there was sand on us, but we kept on.</sentence><sentence id="1046">We saw the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know, with lights and people far away.</sentence><sentence id="1047">We saw the dogs and things and we kept on walking all night, and we still had this sensation that we didn't understand, something that felt like sand on us.</sentence><sentence id="1048">Then, when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, all the lights were very bright in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1049">And then we saw the officers.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1050">They were healthy, and in their uniforms, and clean, and they were in a <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for us.</sentence><sentence id="1051">They asked us to throw the coats on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and when we took the coats off, we realized they were full of lice.</sentence><sentence id="1052">And our whole bodies were full of lice because basically what they wanted-- They had no way to transport these coats with lice, so they had us carry them over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341"

class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not too big, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, so what they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they just chose, did a selection and picked some of the people to work in some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> so some went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, others went to others.</sentence><sentence id="1059">That's why they did the selection and took randomly, people to go in one
