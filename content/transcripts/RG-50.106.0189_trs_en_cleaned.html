<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: You know I can't tell you that.</sentence><sentence id="201">I'm assuming it was a mixture.</sentence><sentence id="202">My parents used to have parties, give parties and were careful to mix Christian and Jews together.</sentence><sentence id="203">And you know we sort of peaked at what was going on at the parties sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="204">We had some close relatives who played a large part in the future of our family.</sentence><sentence id="205">The name was Pariser, P-A-R-I-S-E-R. My cousin and Hannah Pariser were, sorry, my father and Hannah Pariser were first cousins.</sentence><sentence id="206">They</sentence><sentence id="208">were from the Milsch family, M-I-L-S-C-H.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: <span class="BUILDING">Public school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: It was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Boys and girls?</sentence><sentence id="266">Both religions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Yes, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="271">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="272">You have to realize that I didn't know I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="273">Nor did my sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="279">But you were Lutheran.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: Ok.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: So I just thought I was like everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="290">And it was fine.</sentence><sentence id="291">You know I had friends and made friends.</sentence><sentence id="292">I remember going roller skating on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">With them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: So those are really among your earliest memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Yeah right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Hitler came into power in 33.</sentence><sentence id="304">When were you first aware of him or had heard of him or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Well I think I heard his name.</sentence><sentence id="306">I heard talk about him.</sentence><sentence id="307">You know in retrospect, there were you know discussions that went on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with other people that we weren't supposed to hear anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="308">I didn't really know what they meant.</sentence><sentence id="309">I think my sister knew much more.</sentence><sentence id="310">Realized much more but she did not know that she was a Jew either.</sentence><sentence id="311">And it wasn't until and I'm not sure the exact time but it must have been early 1938.</sentence><sentence id="312">When the, there was an edict that Jewish children could no longer go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and we had to go to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">Just for Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="323">And that was the point at which our parents told us that we were -- no they didn't even tell us we were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="324">That came later.</sentence><sentence id="325">No they just told us we had to move <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: But how did the authorities know.</sentence><sentence id="330">I just know if you ever asked your parents later why they then considered you Jewish in the sense that they didn't bring you up that way.</sentence><sentence id="331">You were christened.</sentence><sentence id="332">Why did they follow that edict if you were Christian?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: They had no choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: Do you know how they, I know this is they're telling you the story but how did they say that they knew that they didn't have a choice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Well I think you know my father in his job was well known as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="342">With a name like Friedenthal you couldn't be anything else.</sentence><sentence id="343">And so no I mean it was known that they were Jewish by many people and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Openly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Yeah, I don't think it was talked about but and my father had this, this view which I only learned only later but because he was, he had fought in the first World War.</sentence><sentence id="355">He had gotten the what, Iron Cross.</sentence><sentence id="356">And he had a high position in a well-known <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">And that nothing would happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="358">And of course initially nothing did.</sentence><sentence id="359">And that was probably because I don't know who the Interior Minister was at the time.</sentence><sentence id="360">But my, again this is something I had learned later was that, that he told Hitler that if he rounded up all the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> at once, the economy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would collapse.</sentence><sentence id="361">And so he'd better do it slowly.</sentence><sentence id="362">And I think that gave my father a false sense of safety.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Before we get to when you had to leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, did you have a lot of religious training up to that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: So it was on paper.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: It was just yeah and we would you know at Christmas my father would read the Christmas story from St. Luke and we were taught to say the Lord's prayer and really though giving very little instruction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Do you remember having Jewish friends and not knowing that you were Jewish, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: No, I had no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: If your friends were Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: Right and my sister tells, just told me a story that when she was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that, that one day it must have been shortly before we switched <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">One day one of the girls in her <span class="BUILDING">class</span> said to her, your father is a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="395">And she said no, he's a banker.</sentence><sentence id="396">She had no idea what, I mean that shows you, you know how totally isolated we were from that whole idea and then I guess the other thing came when we left.</sentence><sentence id="397">When we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in January 1939.</sentence><sentence id="398">And my mother showed us, you know we didn't have passports or anything, we just had I forget what it was called.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: ID papers.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1909">Q: Again, how aware were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: Oh then I was very aware because first of all the cousins there, they were second cousins actually.</sentence><sentence id="1912">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parisers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1913">They were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and so they would come back on weekends but you know they were there during the Blitz.</sentence><sentence id="1914">And we were, I mean we would hear things go over.</sentence><sentence id="1915">We were maybe twenty miles north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> go over.</sentence><sentence id="1916">And then later the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V-1</span>'s and V-2's, yeah rockets.</sentence><sentence id="1917">And you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V-2's</span> if you didn't hear them anymore, you knew they were dropping.</sentence><sentence id="1918">But that was, and after my, when my father was released his cousin, this textile guy was starting just a small business where he used I don't know what they call it.</sentence><sentence id="1919">A <span class="INT_SPACE">cutting floor</span> remnants and I don't know whether he or somebody else, they designed slippers and tam-o-shanters and gloves and all kinds of things to be made from these wool remnants.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1948">And then also she learned to sew.</sentence><sentence id="1949">We used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> on Saturdays and there was usually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there, a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which had on it old things and that's where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> came from for very little money.</sentence><sentence id="1950">And one day we saw it and there was an ancient <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Singer sewing machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1951">You know the kind, the treadle kind.</sentence><sentence id="1952">And so she said, hey that's what I want.</sentence><sentence id="1953">And so somehow or other, she arranged to get them to deliver it.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And she taught herself to sew.</sentence><sentence id="1955">Again Hannah Pariser helped her.</sentence><sentence id="1956">She knew how.</sentence><sentence id="1957">And from then on she sewed all my clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1958">She sewed my, when she could, my uniforms for <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1959">And I did very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1960">The friend up the <span class="DLF">road</span> and I we sort of competed, not very hard but as to who would be first in the class and who would be second.</sentence><sentence id="1961">And she was smart.</sentence><sentence id="1962">And</sentence><sentence id="1964">we really didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1965">But and the one thing there though that made me very unhappy was that most of the you know you were always, I was always a hanger on to a group that I really wanted to be a part of.</sentence><sentence id="1966">And they would tolerate me but I wasn't part of the group.</sentence><sentence id="1967">And they were all Girl Guides, Girl Scouts.</sentence><sentence id="1968">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1969">And that's what I wanted to be.</sentence><sentence id="1970">You know I wanted to be a Girl Guide too.</sentence><sentence id="1971">And then maybe I could become really part of the group.</sentence><sentence id="1972">But that was one thing my parents said absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="1973">You are not going to be in any outfit with uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1974">We've seen enough of what goes on with those.</sentence><sentence id="1975">And of course they didn't know anything about the Girl Guide movement.</sentence><sentence id="1976">I got a Girl Guide book and showed it to them.</sentence><sentence id="1977">And said you know it's all right and these are all good people.</sentence><sentence id="1978">They said no.</sentence><sentence id="1979">You can't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1980">So that was very hard I found not to be able to, of course they'd go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

anything.</sentence><sentence id="2247">I wanted to be British but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2248">Q: So you graduated in 46 you say or got your certificate?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: I got my school certificate but then I went on to, at that point you can specialize.</sentence><sentence id="2250">You can decide what <span class="REGION">area</span> you want to do in <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and my sister had specialized in romance languages and I was good at those too but I decided that I didn't want to do the same thing she was doing.</sentence><sentence id="2251">And I had gotten, I enjoyed being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looking at the flowers and insects and all those things.</sentence><sentence id="2252">So I decided I'd go into the sciences.</sentence><sentence id="2253">And so that was 45, 46.</sentence><sentence id="2254">46.I switched <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, my sister had been in the <span class="BUILDING">Per school</span> which was a very good <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2255">I spent you could spend two years or three years there but I was very young so I actually spent three years.</sentence><sentence id="2256">But also so that I hoped I would be able to get a state scholarship which would pay for everything when I went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2257">If I stayed the extra year and got a distinction in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I wanted to go into.</sentence><sentence id="2258">And that worked out.</sentence><sentence id="2259">And I didn't apply, I applied to the two <span class="BUILDING">women's colleges</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Cambridge university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2260">And then I applied to <span class="BUILDING">Bedford College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2261">You didn't apply to many <span class="NPIP">places</span> in those days, very much.</sentence><sentence id="2262">And I got on the waiting list for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and I mean fairly quickly got told that I had gotten in.</sentence><sentence id="2263">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">Cambridge University</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">Girton College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2264">That was great.</sentence><sentence id="2265">And particularly because virtually everything was paid for by the state and got a state scholarship.</sentence><sentence id="2266">Oh yes, but the problem then came.</sentence><sentence id="2267">In 1940, let's see where are we.</sentence><sentence id="2268">In 1948 my father went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2269">My mother stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Albans</span> cause she had gotten herself a job in working on interchange with <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> German and English students.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And so she loved that job and she loved being independent.</sentence><sentence id="2271">But she stayed basically because I wasn't 18 yet.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And that anyhow didn't help because it turned out that they didn't want to leave me in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> without having citizenship because I was going to be alone.</sentence><sentence id="2273">Well my sister was there.</sentence><sentence id="2274">And so it turned out that you couldn't apply for citizenship until you were 21.</sentence><sentence id="2275">So then we went through this period where my headmistress, various other people wrote letters for me</sentence><sentence id="2277">saying ok this, this girl is going to be 18 in May.</sentence><sentence id="2278">She will be alone in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with, her parents will be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2279">And she will have absolutely no status whatsoever unless she can become a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="2280">And so eventually I became a citizen and when I turned 18.</sentence><sentence id="2281">They agreed that this was reasonable.</sentence><sentence id="2282">And then I applied for scholarships everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="2283">And it was very funny because the county of Cambridge also provided scholarships with a lot of money if you needed it.</sentence><sentence id="2284">And I was, I think my father said that he could provide 100 pounds a year or something.</sentence><sentence id="2285">And but that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2286">And so I needed my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, tuition and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And I got a state scholarship which actually paid for everything.</sentence><sentence id="2288">And I got a letter from the Cambridge county congratulating me on getting state scholarship and they said and I have to tell you we are particularly grateful
