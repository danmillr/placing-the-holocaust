<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: The date is Sunday March 29, 1992.</sentence><sentence id="24">We're speaking with Dr. Liane Reif-Lehrer about her parents.</sentence><sentence id="25">What can you tell us, let's start with your mother, is that all right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Can you tell us her name, her date of birth, her place of birth, anything you know about her childhood, anything at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="34">My mother's name was Klara Gottfried Reif.</sentence><sentence id="35">G-o-t-t-f-r-i-e-d,.</sentence><sentence id="36">She was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span> which is now called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">She was apparently somewhat of a rambunctious young lady.</sentence><sentence id="38">She often said that she -- I guess she didn't get along with her father as well as with her mother.</sentence><sentence id="39">She liked to run around and travel and do a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="40">She spoke several languages because when she was a child, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> kept changing and so at one point, where she was born, was part o <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">I think both she and my father were actually Austrian citizens because when they were born, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, then the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="42">She spoke Polish, Russian, German; I think she spoke some Czechoslovakian and she might have been conversant with a couple of other languages.</sentence><sentence id="43">She always said she spoke five or seven languages, I never remember whether it's five or seven.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Do you know what they spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I think at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they probably spoke a combination of Polish and Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="58">Yeah, I think that was correct.</sentence><sentence id="59">My mother did a lot of traveling around.</sentence><sentence id="60">She used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span> to have clothes made and so on.</sentence><sentence id="61">I think she went off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at some point also.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you know what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="74">Was it a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="78">No, it was definitely not a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> and I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="79">Ihave a feeling it might have been more like a <span class="BUILDING">finishing school</span> or just some kind of general <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">She definitely finished <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> but did not go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> but she was pretty clever.</sentence><sentence id="81">She was very, very good with numbers and she did a lot of reading.</sentence><sentence id="82">Anyway at some -- I think she was very interested when she was young in fashion and that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="83">At some point she went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> either for a vacation or to have clothes made, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="84">Somehow and I don't know how, but she met my father.</sentence><sentence id="85">Ultimately they got engaged and then they got married, I think in 1925.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: They got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: They got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, well, I'm not sure about that.</sentence><sentence id="98">I'm not sure about that, they might have gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to get married.</sentence><sentence id="99">But anyway, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after they got married.</sentence><sentence id="100">Then in 1927, my brother was born.</sentence><sentence id="101">Now my mother tells me about her life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">She said in the beginning it was kind of hard.</sentence><sentence id="103">My father had been trained as a physician and then he went back and retrained as a dentist and he opened his practice.</sentence><sentence id="104">Now one of the things my mother always told me is that we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Este</span> , that's the first district in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">I guess that was not such a nice -- or the nicest part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">Excuse me, the Este is where she would have liked to live stories are true or apocryphal but her role was to put on a white glove after the servants came and go around to make sure that they had cleaned well.</sentence><sentence id="107">I think she went and I think they did a fair amount of socializing.</sentence><sentence id="108">I think they went to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span> and they would go dancing and go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">I know they went -- apparently once a week they went to play cards with this relative who actually -- the daughter lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="110">They must have done a lot of things like that.</sentence><sentence id="111">I think my father was a fairly serious person and my mother was probably a more -- I don't know, a more frivolous person.</sentence><sentence id="112">Actually my brother apparently didn't do very well with my mother because he was a very serious kid and he really liked my father.</sentence><sentence id="113">But he thought my mother wasted her time even when he was very little.</sentence><sentence id="114">Then --.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Can we back up just a little?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="136">A Yeah go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Do you know about her life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before she moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>?</sentence><sentence id="139">Do you know about, for example, the Jewish aspect of their life?</sentence><sentence id="140">Were they religious, were they <span class="BUILDING">orthodox</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: I think her parents were orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="145">I don't know that my mother really -- I mean my mother always did all the very traditional kinds of things but I'm not sure she really believed in any of that.</sentence><sentence id="146">I don't know, she certainly had some sorts of superstitions involved in Jewish religion but I have a funny feeling that she probably went along with the things.</sentence><sentence id="147">I don't think she and my father had -- we didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span> and we --.</sentence><sentence id="148">I think they did go to services on the high holidays and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="149">I'd be curious to know whether we -- I'm sure we ate matzo on Passover but the real question is did we also eat bread?</sentence><sentence id="150">I don't know what the answer is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Was it ham on matzo?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="161">Well, I'm sure we ate ham.</sentence><sentence id="162">I'm absolutely sure we ate ham.</sentence><sentence id="163">We probably didn't eat bread at Passover but it was not -- I don't think it was terribly compulsive.</sentence><sentence id="164">I think it was fairly casual.</sentence><sentence id="165">I have a feeling that her father was probably not very casual and I don't know about her mother.</sentence><sentence id="166">I have a feeling that the mother was a more worldly woman and the father may have been a more sort of retiring religious kind of person.</sentence><sentence id="167">I think that my mother always felt that she was considered the black sheep.</sentence><sentence id="168">Not by her mother, but by her father, that her father didn't like her as well as he liked the other two kids.</sentence><sentence id="169">I think she thought that was because she was sort of rebellious and didn't do the things that the other kids did.</sentence><sentence id="170">Definitely, my mother's brother and sister sound like more traditional kids.</sentence><sentence id="171">They got married and they had kids and they stayed, I think, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, or nearby.</sentence><sentence id="172">Here was this young chick going off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and marrying strange people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Did she ever find out the exact fate of her family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Yeah, well, in 1946, when I would have been 12 and I remember this very dramatically.</sentence><sentence id="195">There was a blue letter that came from somebody, one of her relatives.</sentence><sentence id="196">I think it might have been this guy called, Moshe Weinhaub who went to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and whose son is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and is a physician, I think.</sentence><sentence id="197">Of course, I lost contact after my mother died.</sentence><sentence id="198">I think the letter was from this guy Moshe Weinhaub.</sentence><sentence id="199">It told in very great detail what happened to all the relatives.</sentence><sentence id="200">Well, they all perished in one <span class="NPIP">form</span> or another.</sentence><sentence id="201">Now my mother's sister, that was the most dramatic thing.</sentence><sentence id="202">Apparently they forced her to watch while they threw her kids into an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and then they shot her.</sentence><sentence id="203">That was really a horror story.</sentence><sentence id="204">I think my mother's brother and maybe the parents -- I remember him describing that a lot of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had typhoid.</sentence><sentence id="205">They purposely tried to contract typhoid and they did so they died of the typhoid.</sentence><sentence id="206">They purposely did that because they didn't want to die in what they knew was awaiting them.</sentence><sentence id="207">There were just descriptions of what happened to everybody that he knew about.</sentence><sentence id="208">I don't know whatever happened to that letter.</sentence><sentence id="209">As a matter of fact, it's really weird.</sentence><sentence id="210">This is my mother's -- those two pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> are my mother's.</sentence><sentence id="211">Since my mother died.</sentence><sentence id="212">I have not been able to find the key to this.</sentence><sentence id="213">Every once in a while, I try to get it open because I keep thinking that maybe there are some letters and things in there.</sentence><sentence id="214">I know I could probably get a locksmith to open it but I probably have mixed feelings.</sentence><sentence id="215">Part of me wants to know what's behind those little <span class="DLF">doors</span> and part of me probably doesn't.</sentence><sentence id="216">But anyway, my mother -- I think my mother was a very, very different person after the war from what she was before.</sentence><sentence id="217">Although I can't really judge that, that's kind of a guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: I made you jump.</sentence><sentence id="243">Now why don't we come back to the time that she had given birth to your brother, I guess?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Right, 1927, April 24, 1927.</sentence><sentence id="247">My brother was apparently a very serious little boy even at age two.</sentence><sentence id="248">My mother always told stories about how when she would go for a walk with him, instead of wanting to sort of play and so on, he would want to have her read the street signs.</sentence><sentence id="249">What does that say, how do you spell that, what are the letters?</sentence><sentence id="250">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="251">That's her perception.</sentence><sentence id="252">My brother -- I have a picture of my brother sitting all dressed up with a little Lord Fauntleroy tie in a <span class="DLF">sandbox</span> with his rear end up -- sort of off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> so he wouldn't get himself dirty.</sentence><sentence id="253">My brother sort of tells, with some resentment, that he wasn't allowed to be a little boy because they dressed him up and he always felt he couldn't get dirty.</sentence><sentence id="254">I think there were a lot of interesting dynamics there.</sentence><sentence id="255">Then at age three, they started him on violin lessons.</sentence><sentence id="256">Somehow it didn't work out so they stopped at the advice of the teacher, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="257">Then he started again at the age five.</sentence><sentence id="258">Then it really took hold very well and he really did play the violin.</sentence><sentence id="259">If you ask him, he'll say, well you know, I'm not -- I can't really play very well.</sentence><sentence id="260">But he really plays.</sentence><sentence id="261">I mean for an amateur, he plays extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="262">Then when my father died -- well first my father got very depressed because, well, because things were obviously looking very bad in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="263">I really should back up.</sentence><sentence id="264">Starting in 1933.</sentence><sentence id="265">I think things</sentence><sentence id="267">started being politically very hairy.</sentence><sentence id="268">People had just come out of a Depression.</sentence><sentence id="269">As an aside, all my life, I was always really bothered that I might have been an accident because I'm seven and a half years younger than my brother.</sentence><sentence id="270">Subliminally that always bothered me and I never had the guts to ask anybody which in retrospect seems silly.</sentence><sentence id="271">But actually I was over forty once when I asked my brother, was I an accident?</sentence><sentence id="272">My brother said, no, absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="273">Why did they wait so long?</sentence><sentence id="274">Because of the Depression.</sentence><sentence id="275">I was born in 1934, in November and so things were --.</sentence><sentence id="276">Now as I think back on it, it was a really dumb time to have a kid because things were not looking good.</sentence><sentence id="277">Did I send you the article I wrote for <span class="BUILDING">Boston Magazine</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: You sent me one about your cousin?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: I didn't send you one from <span class="BUILDING">Boston Magazine</span>?</sentence><sentence id="315">I should give that to you because that's sort of about this subject.</sentence><sentence id="316">Anyway, so then I was born, and then things started getting bad.</sentence><sentence id="317">They got worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="318">My father and mother started talking about the possibility of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">Apparently my father just felt - - in 1934 my father was already forty years old, right?</sentence><sentence id="320">So his feeling was, how can I go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="321">I don't know the language; I would have to retrain.</sentence><sentence id="322">We would get there and we would have nothing so it just didn't seem like a reasonable thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="323">But then in August of 1938, I think it was, my father, like everybody else, had to close because Jews were not allowed to work any more.</sentence><sentence id="324">My father got really, really, very, very depressed.</sentence><sentence id="325">My brother, I think my brother really still has and had all the time, a really tremendous resentment about my mother not handling that right.</sentence><sentence id="326">I've asked him about that and he says well, she used to say well you know you got to come out of this.</sentence><sentence id="327">You can't walk around like this.</sentence><sentence id="328">She would kind of go off then and do whatever needed to be done.</sentence><sentence id="329">I said to my brother, well what did you do?</sentence><sentence id="330">He said, well I remember standing in a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> holding his hand, just quietly.</sentence><sentence id="331">Now that I'm at my present age and our kids are 22 and 24, I realize that it was just a very difficult situation for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="332">How, if somebody else is just very depressed all the time and you really don't know how to get the person out of it, I think after a while maybe it's kind of a survival thing.</sentence><sentence id="333">That you've got to just keep doing what are your daily things because otherwise you're going to go insane also.</sentence><sentence id="334">I don't know what was going on there but it was a really bad scenario, really very unpleasant things were happening to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="335">I'm sure that my father must have been extremely frightened.</sentence><sentence id="336">There's a woman who actually went to medical and then <span class="BUILDING">dental school</span> with my father.</sentence><sentence id="337">We were always friendly with that family.</sentence><sentence id="338">For example, that woman was forced to go out and scrub the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="339">All sorts of demeaning things happening and I think it must have been just a terrible, terrible time psychologically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Until the time that he was forced to stop working, he worked regularly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="368">A Yes, I think he did work regularly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Even if maybe he was beginning to be depressed or whatever?</sentence><sentence id="377">He didn't --?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="381">I think he got very depressed after he had to close his <span class="BUILDING">practice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">Now I don't know that for sure, I just know that from things that I've gathered.</sentence><sentence id="383">Anyway, my mother, I think, tried to keep going about her business.</sentence><sentence id="384">Somewhere in this time span, they did decide that they would have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="385">So they went and applied for visas and passports and so on.</sentence><sentence id="386">On the morning of September 30, 1938, my father and mother actually left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> together to go pick up those passports.</sentence><sentence id="387">They picked up the passports and at about noontime, they parted to do separate chores.</sentence><sentence id="388">They were supposed to meet, I think, at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of this cousin where they used to play cards.</sentence><sentence id="389">Apparently my father never got there.</sentence><sentence id="390">I guess at about 2:30 in the afternoon, I seem to remember somebody telling me, there was a phone call.</sentence><sentence id="391">My father had been found at the bottom of a <span class="DLF">staircase</span>.</sentence><sentence id="392">I'm not sure whether he was already dead or whether he died either on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or right after he got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">But the death certificate says he died of multiple fractures including a fractured skull and lots of fractured ribs.</sentence><sentence id="394">All my life, I grew up thinking that he had thrown himself off the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> of this -- down the <span class="DLF">stairwell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">There was a lot of trauma around that.</sentence><sentence id="396">My mother did not want -- so the general consensus was that he had committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="397">My mother did not want anybody to know that and I don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="398">You know, it's funny, children don't ask the right questions all the time.</sentence><sentence id="399">I just took that on gospel and I never, ever said anything until quite recently about that.</sentence><sentence id="400">I never told it; I mean practically no one did I tell this to.</sentence><sentence id="401">When I was discussing with my brother recently, he said, well, I've never kept this a secret.</sentence><sentence id="402">Then a few years ago, when I started really thinking about this; I started thinking, well, now how do we know he committed suicide?</sentence><sentence id="403">People say you're just trying to protect yourself from this sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="404">First of all, I don't have anything against this, I just don't.</sentence><sentence id="405">It wouldn't -- in general it wouldn't bother me now.</sentence><sentence id="406">I keep asking myself, does it bother me if he did commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="407">I suppose in one way it doesn't bother me and in another way I think well this was sort of a shirking of your responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="408">You know you had two kids and this was not the appropriate thing to do, to leave your wife alone with these two kids.</sentence><sentence id="409">My brother's idea is that my father probably did commit suicide and that one of the reasons that he did it, aside from being depressed and aside from -- I mean people were committing suicide right and left -- was that he probably figured that a woman with two children would have a much better chance of escaping if there was no husband around.</sentence><sentence id="410">At that time, mostly it was the men who were being really harassed, initially.</sentence><sentence id="411">I don't know but now as a scientist, I sort of stop and I think, well there was nobody there to see this.</sentence><sentence id="412">All sorts of horrible things were happening to Jews, how do we know what really happened?</sentence><sentence id="413">Could he have been pushed?</sentence><sentence id="414">I think the chances are 90% that he probably did commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="415">The other thing is that I keep thinking why would somebody with a medical profession who has access to much neater, cleaner ways of committing suicide throw himself off a <span class="DLF">stairwell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">That's another reason why I think that maybe he didn't do it himself.</sentence><sentence id="417">On the other hand, I suppose that when people commit suicide they're not necessarily being totally rational.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Right, the way some people plan it out.</sentence><sentence id="463">This sounds like it perhaps hadn't been contemplated f or long, this specific act if it was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="466">A: I don't know but somebody recently pointed out to me that Primo Levi who was also a scientist and also had more sophisticated means of committing suicide apparently also jumped off something or other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: Yes, he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: But anyway, the answer is I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="471">When this happened, my mother was just totally devastated, just --.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: Before we -- I hate to break your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of thought?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: No, go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="477">I don't mind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="480">Q: Do you remember anything about her personality before this time?</sentence><sentence id="481">When you were very, very young?</sentence></p></dialogue>
