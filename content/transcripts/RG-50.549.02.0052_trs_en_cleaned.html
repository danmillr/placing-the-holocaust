yes.</sentence><sentence id="345">Revenge was very important for me, and the revenge was important for a few reasons, but the main reason was, when my father was shot in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, the 28" of April, 1942, I witnessed it.</sentence><sentence id="346">And when he was shot by the Gestapo, before he died, he said what a Jew usually says before he dies, God is [indecipherable], we call it the shema Israel.</sentence><sentence id="347">And then he said -- the last words were, ""Nakuma, nakuma, nem nakuma."</sentence><sentence id="348">It means, revenge, revenge, take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="349">Now, he said it in such a voice, that it was not a natural voice, it was something that it came from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, an unnatural voice, which I -- til today, it is already almost 70 years, I can still hear his voice yelling to take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="350">And this gave me strength to survive.</sentence><sentence id="351">I said, "I must survive to take revenge."</sentence><sentence id="352">For this reason, revenge was so important for me.</sentence><sentence id="353">Some people say so what is revenge?</sentence><sentence id="354">Revenge is nothing.</sentence><sentence id="355">Not for me, ben when you started to think, everyone who has a family, and if he would started to think that all his family were killed by certain people, and they were not only killed, before they were killed, they were tortured.</sentence><sentence id="356">Hunger, beating, starvation, and then finally killed, and you will say, "Well, if I can get these men, I am going to kill them."</sentence><sentence id="357">Sure now, in 1999, you don't think about it, because we are normal people, la -- we live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">But in this time, the only dream I had is to take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="359">And for this reason, revenge was so important.</sentence><sentence id="360">Only -- also, this was my father's -- the legacy what I got from my father.</sentence><sentence id="361">Also, revenge was important, I had five sisters.</sentence><sentence id="362">My five sisters were married.</sentence><sentence id="363">They had little children.</sentence><sentence id="364">I was very close to the children, we lived together.</sentence><sentence id="365">And when I started to think, there's a little girl, her name was Blimcha, she was three and a half years.</sentence><sentence id="366">She was like an angel, with gold curled hairs.</sentence><sentence id="367">And if I start to think that this</sentence><sentence id="369"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 13 girl had to be killed, and the others, I had 21 people.</sentence><sentence id="370">Why were they killed?</sentence><sentence id="371">For no -- not because they were bad, they were killed just because they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="372">And if I survived, and if I wouldn't take -- I was the only survivor, and maybe if they are in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, I don't know, they would s -- or -- or before they were killed, they knew, because I always was the one who went down from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, brought food, and brought them candy.</sentence><sentence id="373">And if they would be killed, they would say, "Well, Naftali will take care on it."</sentence><sentence id="374">And they probably thought about it, that I would take care on it.</sentence><sentence id="375">If they are in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, which I don't know if they are, this is a different story, if they are, and if they look down, and they said -- and they looked at me and said, I was the survivor, the survivor to take revenge, and if wouldn't take revenge, I will be a traitor, I would be a disappointment for them, because I was the only one.</sentence><sentence id="376">So I had to take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="377">Now, after the war, after I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I still take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="378">But I cannot go out, take bodily revenge, physical revenge.</sentence><sentence id="379">So my revenge is that I survived the war to tell the story, to tell the cruelties, to tell the murdering things.</sentence><sentence id="380">This is my revenge, and maybe this is the reason I survived.</sentence><sentence id="381">Otherwise, why did I survive, why not the other people?</sentence><sentence id="382">But this is the reason that I survived.</sentence><sentence id="383">In the war it was a physical revenge.</sentence><sentence id="384">Now the revenge is, like I'm speaking to you, I give other testimonies, I go to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">I go -- people ask me -- if somebody asked me to speak about the Holocaust, I am always ready.</sentence><sentence id="386">I never took a penny, people want to pay me, I said, "No, this is not a thing that I want to get paid."</sentence><sentence id="387">Y -- I have to do it, so long as I am alive, because in a few years there will not be survivors.</sentence><sentence id="388">And who knows?</sentence><sentence id="389">If now</sentence><sentence id="391"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 14 we have deniers, where we are still alive, what will be a few years later?</sentence><sentence id="392">So my duty is to tell and retell the cruelties.</sentence><sentence id="393">To tell the stories, because I was a witness.</sentence><sentence id="394">I was there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: We will talk about that more, about your work, your legacy, a little later.</sentence><sentence id="451">Let me just ask you this, in your videotaped interview, you also gave another reason that might have helped you to -- to get through this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="454">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: A letter from your -- from your mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: See, well people ask me -- everybody had a reason why he survived, had a legacy.</sentence><sentence id="459">I had two legacies, and I said I must survive.</sentence><sentence id="460">The first legacy was that my father said revenge, revenge, reven -- this I said, I must live to take revenge, because if -- if my father is in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, as we believe, how would I be able to face him, he ask me, "Did you do something, did you take revenge because they shot me?"</sentence><sentence id="461">I did.</sentence><sentence id="462">Maybe I didn't take enough revenge, looking back, I didn't take enough, but I did.</sentence><sentence id="463">The second legacy was when my mother was taken from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jheshuf</span>, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, cause we were taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbushova</span>, from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jheshuf</span>, where they gathered more Jews, to be able to send them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">And when she was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzyce</span>, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, with all her five sis -- daughters, with the son-in-laws, with her grandchildren, somehow she gave somebody a letter.</sentence><sentence id="465">She could give a letter, and I was on this time in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and they brought the letter to me.</sentence><sentence id="466">And I remember -- I don't have the letter, I would give everything to have the letter, but I don't have it.</sentence><sentence id="467">But I remember the words.</sentence><sentence id="468">And she wrote to me, "You are the youngest of my nine children,</sentence><sentence id="470">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 15 and you know always the youngest is the smartest," in their eyes. "</sentence><sentence id="471">You are young, you are strong, you are smart.</sentence><sentence id="472">You go and survive the war, because after the war, you go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and tell to El," I had a brother already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="473">Tell to El," his name was El, "what the murderers did to us.</sentence><sentence id="474">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>."</sentence><sentence id="475">I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, David.</sentence><sentence id="476">"Go to David, and tell him what the murderers did to us.</sentence><sentence id="477">Go to the world, and tell the world what the murderers did to us."</sentence><sentence id="478">She se -- she also wrote, "Let your being an orphan not break you.</sentence><sentence id="479">Go out, fight, be strong, and survive."</sentence><sentence id="480">This gave me a o-other s -- reason to survive, and for this reason, from the first minute when I was liberated, when people didn't want to tell stories about the Holocaust, from the first minute, I spoke.</sentence><sentence id="481">People, in the beginning, didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="482">They looked at me and they saw this is an obsession, that I speak about the Holocaust, but I spoke.</sentence><sentence id="483">People who survived, they didn't want to speak.</sentence><sentence id="484">It took a long time til they started to speak in the 60's and the 70's.</sentence><sentence id="485">I spoke about the Holocaust in "45, and "46, but people didn't want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="486">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, when I told the people, they thought I'm crazy.</sentence><sentence id="487">They didn't want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="488">This was the legacy from my mother.</sentence><sentence id="489">So those two legacies were the most important thing.</sentence><sentence id="490">It wasn't important that if I am alive, and not alive.</sentence><sentence id="491">So other men will s -- survive.</sentence><sentence id="492">I never -- I never thought that being alive was such an important thing as a personal thing, that I am alive.</sentence><sentence id="493">But a pers -- the important thing were those two legacies that I could fulfill.</sentence></p></dialogue>

I would like you to -- to go back to the time just before liberation.</sentence><sentence id="541">When -- when was that, where were you, and what kinds of state of mind, and physical health were you in at that time?</sentence><sentence id="542">J-Just before liberation, wherever you want to go.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: Well, before liberation -- this was in July, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="544">Now, we were left from 125 Jews -- I'm not talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was gone.</sentence><sentence id="545">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was liquidated July the seventh, 1942, they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jheshuf</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jheshuf</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzyce</span>, they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="546">But then later on we get some people together, and finally we were 125, and from the 125 they started to kill us, and mostly Polish people killed us.</sentence><sentence id="547">And in the book I describe there some raids they made on us.</sentence><sentence id="548">And in -- in July "44, we were left only six people from the whole group.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="555">Q: Who were they?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: The six people -- this was -- I was there with my brother, my older brother Lyebish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="558">He was 16 years older.</sentence><sentence id="559">Then were two brothers, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lybovitch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="560">One was Lyba, and one was Herschel.</sentence><sentence id="561">And the Lyba actually, if not Lyba, we wouldn't survive, because he was a village Jew, and his profession was he was a trapper before the war, and he knew the <span

id="563">He was -- he was like -- like a animal.</sentence><sentence id="564">Not an animal in a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="567">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 17 bad sense, but he knew all those things, h-he could [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="568">So, on account of him, we could survive.</sentence><sentence id="569">And his older brother was with him, so there were Lyba and his brother, I and my bro -- and there were two from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="570">One was Lyebish Nestel, one was Connor.</sentence><sentence id="571">And the -- and the two were cousins, and they survived with us all the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="572">So happens that they were -- the -- the other one was Naftali Connor.</sentence><sentence id="573">And they were religious Jews.</sentence><sentence id="574">During all the time when we were -- they were with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they were with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they were with me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="575">And during all the time, they didn't eat anything that it was not kosher -- it means it was not for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="576">So they only ate a piece of bread, some fruit, vegetables if they had.</sentence><sentence id="577">If we had meat, they wouldn't eat it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="578">If we killed a deer, or we killed a rabbit, they wouldn't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="579">But anyway, they survived.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="580">And after, when they -- the -- when -- when we were liberated in -- in the end of July, so they said, "We -- we are liberated.</sentence><sentence id="581">No more Germans.</sentence><sentence id="582">We are going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="583">And they thought they would come <span

the Polish underground, took them, they wer -- they saw them.</sentence><sentence id="586">And they took them, and they shot them.</sentence><sentence id="587">After going through <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, losing their family, starving, everything, they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="588">And they were killed by very prominent people, not peasants.</sentence><sentence id="589">By two people -- and I know the people who killed them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="590">One, his name was Vladiswav Kishel.</sentence><sentence id="591">He was before the war, dir -- director of the internal revenue in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbushova</span>, for te -- the text director.</sentence><sentence id="592">Intelligent person.</sentence><sentence

id="595">He lived all his life</sentence></p><p><sentence id="598">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 18 with Jews, because the Jews were traveling in the <span

the Russians organized their own leadership.</sentence><sentence id="601">And they saw the two Jews, and they killed them.</sentence><sentence id="602">From the whole group, so we were left only six.</sentence><sentence id="603">Now, I -- I ga --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="604">Q: How -- how did you hear about that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="605">A: Well, I heard it right away, because when they went -- came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they -- I told them not to go, because I knew that nothing good -- because they killed so many during the war, and when they went there -- then later, the Polish people between themselves, everybody knew about it, because this was not done in secret.</sentence><sentence id="606">They took them openly, and they took them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> by the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, and they shot them.</sentence><sentence id="607">And -- and the people who were in my -- in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they told me this [indecipherable] not only one, a few of them.</sentence><sentence id="608">There were some people who were very sympathetic, and they told me.</sentence><sentence id="609">Now, the reason, later -- and I wrote this in my book, and naturally the people are very angry in -- in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> why I wrote it about it, and they said to me, "You shouldn't have write it, because in case this book will be -- will be translated into Polish, this Kishel has," -- he's now 85 years, he lives in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, he had grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="610">So the grandchildren will find out that their grandfather was a murderer.</sentence><sentence id="611">So I shouldn't -- I should retract it, I should write a article that is not true.</sentence><sentence id="612">They said he killed doesn't mean anything, but the children shouldn't know that he was a murderer.</sentence><sentence id="613">This what they wrote to me when the book came out.</sentence><sentence id="614">Now, I found out -- the reason why, which I understand, the reason why -- why in this Kishel, who was the director of the internal revenue, he</sentence><sentence id="616">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 19 volunteered he should kill them, because there were the group of the ar -- of the AK members, and when they caught the two Jews, he volunteered to kill them.</sentence><sentence id="617">Now, why should he volunteer to kill them?</sentence><sentence id="618">The -- the -- the -- the reason was that this one of them, Lyebish Nestel, he was such a nice person, a scholar.</sentence><sentence id="619">You see, both of them were rabbinical students, they were very intelligent people.</sentence><sentence id="620">So before the war, when the war blew out, he was in the active Polish army, and his unit, his regiment was sent over to the <span class="DLF">German border</span>, because they had to protect <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="621">And he was, and he was a very good soldier.</sentence><sentence id="622">Now, also Kishel, the director of the internal revenue was in the reserve, he was an officer.</sentence><sentence id="623">And he was also in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="624">And when the Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, naturally the units started to pull back.</sentence><sentence id="625">And they came to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in -- near the <span class="DLF">German border</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katovitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="626">And this was -- mostly there were Jews, so the Kishel knew this Lyebish Nestel, so he said to him, "Well, why don't you go to the Jews, where you are a Jew, and get two Hassidic coats [indecipherable], and we will change our uniform, and we will go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="627">To change as being Jews.</sentence><sentence id="628">This what he told to Lyebish Nestel.</sentence><sentence id="629">So Lyebish Nestel said to him -- and this was his officer -- and a Polish guy, a patriot.</sentence><sentence id="630">So Lyebish Nestel told him, "I will not do it.</sentence><sentence id="631">1 am in the army.</sentence><sentence id="632">I came here to protect my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, to fight for my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="633">I wouldn't do it."</sentence><sentence id="634">Kishel looked at him, and that's -- this was it.</sentence><sentence id="635">Two days later, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kishel</span> disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="636">He didn't know what a -- probably he did it on his own, he run away.</sentence><sentence id="637">Lyebish Nestel was fighting, fighting, til they came near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">This was deep into the <span class="REGION">Polish countryside</span>, and he was taken as a prisoner by the Germans, as a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="639">Somehow, usually if Jews were taken as prisoners,</sentence><sentence id="641">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 20 they didn't survive, because the Germans killed them.</sentence><sentence id="642">Somehow he run away.</sentence><sentence id="643">He run away, he came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and he told everybody the story.</sentence><sentence id="644">He told the story how is it possible that Kishel -- and Kishel disappeared, nobody knew where he is -- where he was.</sentence><sentence id="645">Naturally, Lyebish was with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he was with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, he was with me two years in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and he got killed.</sentence><sentence id="646"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kishel</span> disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="647">After the war, Kishel became very important because he was a leader in the AK, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, and he was not any more inter -- internal revenue, he was older, he had got married.</sentence><sentence id="648">He -- he had children.</sentence><sentence id="649">He lives now in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">And I wrote his stories.</sentence><sentence id="651">They are now angry why I told his story.</sentence><sentence id="652">I told his story because this is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="653">So those two were killed.</sentence><sentence id="654">So from the six, only four survived.</sentence><sentence id="655">Now, from the four, from the four, six months later, Lyba, who was our savior, who was the trapper, was poisoned in our -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, there he was -- there he was poisoned, he died.</sentence><sentence id="656">His brother Herschel was older, he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> before it -- <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and he died in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="657">Lyebish, my brother, came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and he died in 1965, as a -- got the heart attack, he died.</sentence><sentence id="658">So I am the only one alive from our group, and there were very, very seldom places that Jews organized.</sentence><sentence id="659">So happens we organized in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, nobody survives that.</sentence><sentence id="660">I have to tell those stories.</sentence><sentence id="661">Now, I know every one who got killed.</sentence><sentence id="662">I even wanted to write a book that everybody's dead.</sentence><sentence id="663">How it was, how he was killed, how he was betrayed -- mostly they were betrayed by Poles.</sentence><sentence id="664">Maybe I will do it yet.</sentence><sentence id="665">Why?</sentence><sentence id="666">Because I'm the only one who wa -- I'm alive.</sentence><sentence id="667">And if I would not be alive, nobody would know the stories.</sentence><sentence id="668">I tell to the families.</sentence><sentence id="669">If they</sentence><sentence id="671">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 21 have somebody [indecipherable] how they were with me in the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: Let's go back then, and talk a little bit about your personal liberation.</sentence><sentence id="744">How did it happen, and what -- what did you do afterwards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Well, when my bi -- liberation is, that when it was -- this was after -- after I had to escape from the AK, because like I said to you, I was a member in the AK, and there were a few things, I don't know if you want me to tell you why I left the AK and came back to my brother.</sentence><sentence id="748">So the -- this -- this was -- okay, so -- so I came back, an -- I was about a week or two weeks, but we already saw that it is the end.</sentence><sentence id="749">Why?</sentence><sentence id="750">Because we saw Ericthsook.</sentence><sentence id="751">We saw that the Germans soldiers are coming, and they -- the army, and th- they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> with their equipment.</sentence><sentence id="752">Every day more and more and more German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="753">And we were in this time in hiding, because we didn't have a group any more.</sentence><sentence id="754">So we knew -- and then we started to hear cannons.</sentence><sentence id="755">In every -- the night, the cannons were louder and louder, so we knew that this is the end, but how can we survive til the end, because in the last minute -- we suffered for six years, in the last minute we will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="756">So my brother, with one of those Lybovitch went to a friendly Pole, that we used to go once in awhile to hide there, and they were with them, and I went with Lyba to look, to see, to different peasants.</sentence><sentence id="757">Because we didn't know exactly, we knew it's coming, but we didn't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="758">So I went with Lyba to a peasant, his name was Yanhodor.</sentence><sentence id="759">I had described him, he was very good, he was very friendly, he and his children.</sentence><sentence id="760">So we went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and then we went -- we s -- we heard a unit of</sentence><sentence

-- the -- the front f-fighters, but we didn't do the fighting, but we went with them, they had to be straightened out with the local people, with the administration, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1357">So we went</sentence><sentence id="1359">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 38 with them, and I am describing this in details in the book, and then when we came before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was a very, very important <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, because the first thing it was the most historical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span>, because the capital, it was the capital, and it was the -- the place of the kings.</sentence><sentence id="1360">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6w</span>, and also it was the barbel.</sentence><sentence id="1361"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbel</span> is the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> where all the

going, we went with the front, and they -- did the Russian army went forwards, and the German went back.</sentence><sentence id="1363">So, about three days before we came before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was not ok -- was not taken -- like usually in a war, you go from the -- and this time we went from the east to the west, like the army didn't go from east to the west.</sentence><sentence id="1364">What they did, they wanted to surround, and to destroy the rush -- the German garmi zone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1365">So what the Russian, was a very smart thing what they did, they went -- before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> they went to the north, and then they surrounded, and they came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> from the west.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Because, actually, they had to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> from the east, but they came in thr -- from the west, and we went with them, and we went part of it, and in about three days before we were before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, we find out that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> is mined, that they put in <span class="DLF">mines</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, with columns, with explosives, and the -- and in any minute, the mi -- and -- and -- and their aim is to explode the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and to destroy the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1367">We knew about it, because we had the fifth c-columns that they are doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1368">Now -- so they wanted to -- yes, and as we came to the -- closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> from the west, so the Russian engineers, if -- f-find out that they already found some installations with [indecipherable], where there were important</sentence><sentence id="1370">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 39 <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, but they couldn't destroy the whole thing, because it's like -- like this was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1371">So they could dismantle all -- detach the electricity from the end of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, but this was like -- like a snake.</sentence><sentence id="1372">If you cut off a piece of tail of a snake, the whole snake is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1373">We had to know that central installation from where the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the electricity is connected.</sentence><sentence id="1374">So they picked out -- they picked out three officers to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> and to find out.</sentence><sentence id="1375">And this was before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was even liberated, and th-the Russians picked out.</sentence><sentence id="1376">Now I -- th -- I had very good recommendations, because like I told you that this man wrote to the leaders that he knows me, said I am special in this, I did so much during the underground, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1377">And then we picked out one -- a native <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakowian</span>, who survived the war in -- in th -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and later he joined the Polish army, and he came back with the Polish army, and so he -- wi -- and because he was a native Krak6wian, and so he was very important, and then we -- they invi -- they picked out the other men with us, so three of us, we got the order to go in to see how we can find out where the people who -- who built those things are, maybe we can prevent from the destruction.</sentence><sentence id="1378">And we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, this was winter, it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1379">Remember, we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> January the 17".</sentence><sentence id="1380">The Russians took over part, but the ar -- a big part was still in the German hands, because officially, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was liberated January the 19", and we were there already the 17", through <span class="DLF">channels</span>, and je -- and also we had people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> who were a fifth column for us.</sentence><sentence id="1381">So we contacted some, and we find out that it's true, that the Germans want to destroy, and they built, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, they built columns on the main thoroughfares -- the main <span class="DLF">streets</span>, they built columns s -- f -- a story high, with</sentence><sentence id="1383">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 40 four feet in diameter, filled with

all together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and this had to be destroyed with one push of a button, and we knew that the -- if we will come closer th -- the -- this will happen.</sentence><sentence id="1388">So, we were wor -- we worried very much.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And we started to have leads where finally we find out -- and again, in the book I write a little more about it, you cannot have the whole book here.</sentence><sentence id="1390">We find out that the -- that the company who made those columns, and those <span class="DLF">mines</span> was done by an Austrian company, Meyerader and Krauss.</sentence><sentence id="1391">And the Meyerader and Krauss isn't -- the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> Yuloushalaya, and we find out, and this was a winter night, a blizzard, cold, and we went -- we sent over the three to find out if -- if they -- they -- we can find out something.</sentence><sentence id="1392">They came back they couldn't -- they didn't let in nobody, because every <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a German company, they -- and this was in the most exclusive place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, where the German took over, and then the next [indecipherable] was the Gestapo, and -- and so he ba -- by -- those <span

government was in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1756">Se -- they wanted to have a Communist regime.</sentence><sentence id="1757">So they stopped, and naturally then they withdrew, the Germans withdrew the 10 divisions, they brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and they suppressed them -- their uprise, and -- and they killed 200 fighters, they killed 200 civilians.</sentence><sentence id="1758">They didn't kill them just like Jews, you take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination

class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there, and -- and then -- then th -- about a few months later, the Russians made the last offensive, and they occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1761">So -- so -- so in con -- so tha -- all th- the -- the -- the b -- the manage -- the big shots from the uprise, who were not killed, who were not taken as prisoners, they moved the whole <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> from the uprise to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1762">And then <span

leave, they want to make the uprise.</sentence><sentence id="1764">So they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1765">So this was one also of the reasons that -- about the destruction, they wanted to make destruction we -- there were three reasons actually.</sentence><sentence id="1766">The first reason was that they wanted to make this destroy because they were afraid for a other uprise like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1767">The second reason in -- in -- was because they wanted to slow down the Russian approach.</sentence><sentence id="1768">If the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> will be destroyed, so they will slow down.</sentence><sentence id="1769">The third reason was because the Germans considered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6ew</span> as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span>, and they cou -- like they always -- like all the scientists from</sentence><sentence id="1771">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 51 before, and they always said that they were Germans, not Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1772">So they considered that this a Polish tow -- as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And then when they -- they had to leave it, so they -- they didn't want to leave it [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1774">They said well if we cannot have it, we will destroy it.</sentence><sentence id="1775">So those were the three reasons, but actually the biggest reason was that they wanted to destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, because they couldn't live with it that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> should get the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> untouched.</sentence><sentence id="1776">Because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> there was never bomb, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was never the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> destroyed, so they wanted to destroy the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">Now, would this work, the <span class="DLF">287 mines</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> would -- not one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> would be left, because they -- the way they mined, and they put in

thousands, and thousands of people would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1779">So -- so this was the reason, because the uprise had to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> the same

against Polish people than the Germans.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4300">Nobody did so much harm as the Germans, because after all, they created the Holocaust, they did all the killings, they had all the ideas about extermination, about all those things.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4301">The Polish people collaborated in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="4302">Now, when a German went into the SS, or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Einsatzgruppen</span>, or became a Gestapo man, or killed just for pleasure, he was raised with the idea since he was in Hitler yugen, and he knew that Jew was worse than garbage, worse than a cockroach, that the Jew had to be eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="4303">He was prepared for it.</sentence><sentence id="4304">Even his parents sometimes

worse when I speak about Polish anti-Semitism as hit -- as Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4311">Because nothing is worse than the Germans, because they did that, the worst thing, but each individual in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- why did the Polish people have to collaborate with the Germans where he was under German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="4312">The Germans killed see --

should have -- have compassion with the Jews, who had the same problem, but they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="4318">So for this reason I feel -- there were Poles who helped, very few, small percentage.</sentence><sentence id="4319">People ask me -- I go and speak, they ask me, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew -- I'm not talking about Germans, I'm talking about Poles, what percentage of Poles would kill a Jew, what percentage wouldn't kill, but wouldn't help, and what percentage would help?</sentence><sentence id="4320">And I was thinking about it a long time.</sentence><sentence id="4321">I came to the conclusion 75 percent of the Poles would kill a Jew for no reason at all; giving out to the Germans, or kill them themselves.</sentence><sentence id="4322">And don't forget, if a Pole gave out a Jew during the war, he got a kilo of sugar, or he -- he got a quart of kerosene.</sentence><sentence id="4323">If he gave out five Jews, he got five kilo of sugar, imagine what a sweet life he had.</sentence><sentence id="4324">75 percent.</sentence><sentence id="4325">40 percent -- not 40 percent, 20 -- I said 23 percent -- 75 percent would give

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4352">Q: How did you figure that, though?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4354">A: Well, so let me answer you.</sentence><sentence id="4355">One percent will give out -- will help.</sentence><sentence id="4356">So I said, who is

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringenblume</span> will be right, one percent.</sentence><sentence id="4366">So it means my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had to save 20

were good Polish patriots, and they wanted to kill the Bolshevik bandits.</sentence><sentence id="5425">And this what they -- when they ki -- they say -- they sued the government.</sentence><sentence id="5426">So th -- so one got in --</sentence><sentence id="5428">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 140 from the government, they gave him something, 400 million zlotas, which it was not millions, it

about 300 Poles who were arrested for killing Jews, all of them started to sue the government, that they say that we killed Jewish Bolshevik bandits.</sentence><sentence id="5431">And it's a very

class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 142 victims.</sentence><sentence id="5508">So -- so he wanted to keep it as a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span>, and -- and -- and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5577">A: Well, to be -- which is important that -- look, we can talk and talk, there is a lot of things important, but, about the Holocaust I think the most important thing is, is not to forget that there was a Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5578">Because we cannot have the six million people die in vain.</sentence><sentence id="5579">And in vain I mean they die, and there will be no remembrance, and there will not be no -- ho-how should I say it?</sentence><sentence id="5580">That the people should not cry after them, because they died for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="5581">That we should talk about them.</sentence><sentence id="5582">So this is very important.</sentence><sentence id="5583">And - - and the boo -- all the books, every book which is written, from every Holocaust, if the book is good, if the book is bad.</sentence><sentence id="5584">Some are better, some are not so good, but everybody has to tell a story, and it's -- I encourage always when people say well, I want to write a</sentence><sentence id="5586">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 144 book, I encourage them, and if I can help them in any way, I do.</sentence><sentence id="5587">Because everybody has a different story.</sentence><sentence id="5588">So naturally some book are not so important, they are not -- but still, it's an important thing, because this is written by a survivor, and if he survived, it is important. [</sentence><sentence id="5589">clock chiming].</sentence><sentence id="5590">Well, so this is -- this is mostly what, you know, so the children should be -- they should be taught -- they should be rem-reminded, and they should be told about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5591">Because, if the children of my sisters, who were three and a half, four, five years old, if they will know that 50 years later, somebody will speak about them, maybe their life, their death wouldn't be so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="5592">There will say somebody will remember me 50 years later.</sentence><sentence id="5593">But if -- and also, I want -- now I have my -- I have my pictures that I saved, 500 photos.</sentence><sentence id="5594">I remember the names, I remember the organizations they belong, and I want now to have an album.</sentence><sentence id="5595">I don't know if you ever saw Vishniak's album.</sentence><sentence id="5596">There was a man tha -- he wrote -- he had pictures from life [indecipherable] in Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5597">I want to have this album.</sentence><sentence id="5598">The reason why -- and I want to mention everybody who is in the pictures, everybody's name, because I want that someday -- not someday, this -- everybody's name should be mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="5599">It shouldn't be like he lived like -- like comes in autumn, the leaves dry out, the wind comes, blows away the leave, and the leave disappears, like this was never -- it was never a leave.</sentence><sentence id="5600">It's the same thing, I don't want that the person who lived, and the Holocaust killed them, the people were killed, and they disappeared, and the name was never mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="5601">Because he was a human being, he was alive, he had dreams.</sentence><sentence id="5602">He wanted to live, and to have a future, to have children, have grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="5603">But he was wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="5604">So I want this person, should</sentence><sentence id="5606"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 145 be written down that there was a man who lived.</sentence><sentence id="5607">I have his picture.</sentence><sentence id="5608">And then the pictures should see this is how he looked.</sentence><sentence id="5609">This what I want, and this what my <span class="NPIP">dream</span> is, to have an album with everybody's picture, it should be recorded that there was once a man like this, and he was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="5610">So there are certain things that I still would like to do.</sentence><sentence id="5611">And if I will do it, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="5612">I try.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5651">Q: My last question has sort of two parts.</sentence><sentence id="5652">One is, you mentioned in the videotaped interview that you didn't want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but you -- you went, and you never thought you could as -- achieve as much as you have.</sentence><sentence id="5653">My question -- my first question then is, what did you achieve?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5657">A: Well, yeah, I didn't want to come <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, because -- I think I explained to you, my aim was -- my dream was a --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5658">Q: Yes, but what did -- but what did --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5659">A: -- and then when I came <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, like I said to you that when I -- in the beginning, I couldn't make a living, I didn't have a job, and I was nobody, because here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is -- even if you are nobody, but when you have money, you give charity, you become somebody.</sentence><sentence id="5660">So then, what I achieved, I established a business, I established certain things that -- donations.</sentence><sentence id="5661">I helped my family in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> if I could.</sentence><sentence id="5662">I -- and -- and -- and -- I -- I am involved in -- in a lot of organizations, and -- and people know me.</sentence><sentence id="5663">Like, for instance, if we go someplace, and my wife is always, see this is Norman Salsitz, he wrote this article, nor -- so this is an achievement, that I am somebody, and it doesn't mean that I have to make money out of it, but I want to be involved, and I am involved.</sentence><sentence id="5664">Some people</sentence><sentence id="5666"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 146 they -- they didn't want to be involved.</sentence><sentence id="5667">And ever -- if I belonged to organization, I cannot just belong to organization, and to say, well I -- I belong to organization, I pay dues and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="5668">If I belong to org -- organization, I have to be active.</sentence><sentence id="5669">Otherwise I don't belong to the organization.</sentence><sentence id="5670">And achievement is like three years ago, I -- I was the man of the year here in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="5671">indecipherable] made a nice -- and a f -- and a few years before, from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, once, I was honored.</sentence><sentence id="5672">This was a -- this is an achievement that I am doing something, and then the people try to -- to pay back something.</sentence><sentence id="5673">Not in money, but some acknowledgement.</sentence><sentence id="5674">And everybody wants to have some acknowledgement.</sentence><sentence id="5675">So this what I meant, that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I started to make a living, maybe a little better than -- more than a living, and -- and we live like -- like American people.</sentence><sentence id="5676">Live a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5677">My daughter got married, I bought her a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5678">She opened her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, I bought her a -- I bought her a -- a <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5679">Two weeks ago I went, and I bought her a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5680">She wanted a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the -- on the -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>, it to -- should be close to where the ski -- because they going skiing every weekend in the winter, so this will be close.</sentence><sentence id="5681">So this is an achievement, that I could do it for my daughter.</sentence><sentence id="5682">Now, I don't know if she could do it on her own, but if I did it, and for my grandchildren, this is an achievement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5709">Q: Well, maybe that was already the answer to my very last question, but let me say this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5711">In the very beginning of this interview, I asked you who was Naftali Salishitz, and then I asked you who was Taddek.</sentence><sentence id="5712">Now I ask you who then is Norman Salsitz at this point?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5715"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 147</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5716">A: Well, Norman Salsitz is all of those things, all of those things.</sentence><sentence id="5717">Now, if I speak about something, and if I want to say something from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbushova</span>, I alway -- I call it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5718">I am -- I was there 22 years, but I am in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> 50 years, more than double, but still this -- even <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is dear to me, and I think -- I think the best -- biggest patriots <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had -- has, are people -- newcomers, because we appreciate <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5719">Some people who are born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, they don't appreciate <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5720">We appreciate.</sentence><sentence id="5721">And then, if -- if -- so I love <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but still, when I say <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I have my little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, this is my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5722">Taddek was when I survived, and to be -- why did I survive?I fought back.</sentence><sentence id="5723">I didn't survive because I was standing there with my hands down when I was laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, shot four times.</sentence><sentence id="5724">And if I wouldn't be able to grab my revolver, and to kill them, I wouldn't be alive, because they were -- today I got a letter from one of the people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in -- a very nasty letter, a very anti-Semitic letter.</sentence><sentence id="5725">She is the head of the culture and history department.</sentence><sentence id="5726">She was a professor in <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5727">A very anti-Semitic letter.</sentence><sentence id="5728">And I answered her also a very strong letter.</sentence><sentence id="5729">And then later she wrote to me, which I never answered, she said, "Well, I didn't," -- I accused her of being anti- Semitic, she said, "But I didn't kill nobody, but you are a murderer."</sentence><sentence id="5730">Why am I murderer?</sentence><sentence id="5731">Because I killed those two guys.</sentence><sentence id="5732">So when I was laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, wounded four times, I should have | -- be there, and beg them give me one more bullet, and finish me off.</sentence><sentence id="5733">But because I protected myself, and my brother, and I shot them, so n-naturally I am a murderer.</sentence><sentence id="5734">So -- so when it comes Taddek, Taddek is somebody who refused to die.</sentence><sentence id="5735">When it comes to Norman Salsitz, Norman Salsitz is all of those things.</sentence><sentence id="5736">Now, I am</sentence><sentence id="5738"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 148 living, I am in a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I can do anything I want.</sentence><sentence id="5739">I never had anything bad from the government in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5740">They never did anything wrong to me, and I can speak up.</sentence><sentence id="5741">If something is wrong, I open my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="5742">I have -- I have stories here is that something happens in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span>, something happens there, but I always spoke up, and I always could yell, and I always could say what I want.</sentence><sentence id="5743">Nobody said be -- be quiet because you are a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="5744">Nobody yet.</sentence><sentence id="5745">There were some people who have anti-Semitic remarks, but nobody yet told me [indecipherable], nobody kicked me because I am a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="5746">And this is what <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="5747">I can be what I am, and I am not afraid that somebody will say you cannot be this, you cannot be this because you somebody different.</sentence><sentence id="5748">And this what I tell the children when I spoke to them.</sentence><sentence id="5749">You should be on the watch, if some skinhead, or somebody comes to you, and will -- he will tell you a story that this Black is not good, that this Oriental is not good, this Jew is not good.</sentence><sentence id="5750">You should always answer, and you should always stay on guard, and then, we will not have a Holocaust in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5751">But if nobody will say it, who knows?</sentence><sentence id="5752">There will be enou -- enough people, they will get bigger and bigger, and we could have problems.</sentence><sentence id="5753">So this the people -- the children understand.</sentence><sentence id="5754">But being in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I think is a privilege, and the privilege is because I can be anything I want.</sentence><sentence id="5755">I can be -- so long as I'm not against the law.</sentence><sentence id="5756">The only thing I cannot be is a president, because I was not born here.</sentence><sentence id="5757">But otherwise, I can be anything [indecipherable] capable, I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="5758">Nobody can stop me.</sentence><sentence id="5759">My daughter, she is a daughter of survivors, she is a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="5760">My son-in-law, he's a third generation, he's my son-in-law, he's a assistant professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5761">He's acknowledged, he goes around all the world.</sentence><sentence id="5764"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0052 149 My grandchildren, I hope they will be something.</sentence><sentence id="5765">They can do it here.</sentence><sentence id="5766">Where we, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for thousand years -- see, I always -- I always was a Polish Jew.</sentence><sentence id="5767">And this what I was hurt.</sentence><sentence id="5768">I wanted to be a Jewish Pole.</sentence><sentence id="5769">Being a Jewish Pole it means I could be a Jew Protestant, I could be a Jew Christian, a Jew cat -- a -- a -- a Jew Catholic, but I wanted to be a Jewish Pole, but no, I was a Polish Jew.</sentence><sentence id="5770">And this is a big difference between a Polish Jew, and a Jewish Pole.</sentence><sentence id="5771">And this what I could never achieve in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5772">Like take for instance, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5773">In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> the Jews were treated very well, and 80 percent of Jews in ta -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> survived.</sentence><sentence id="5774">There were not too many Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, but as many there were, 80 percent survived.</sentence><sentence id="5775">Now you will ask, Mussolini was a partner with Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="5776">Why?</sentence><sentence id="5777">Because the Italian people said, "We don't have Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5778">We have Italians with a different religion."</sentence><sentence id="5779">This what they approved the Jew, a different religion.</sentence><sentence id="5780">And th -- and again, later, when they had undergrounds, so they asked th-the Italians from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, they said, "Why do you go and help the Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="5781">They said, "When we on the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, we fight against Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="5782">Everything what Hitler says, we are opposite.</sentence><sentence id="5783">He says to kill the Jew, so we save them."</sentence><sentence id="5784">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, was different.</sentence><sentence id="5785">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, when he said to kill the Jews, they said -- my wife had a boyfriend, he loved her, and he was everything.</sentence><sentence id="5786">He said, "I hate the Germans, what they do with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but one thing I have to admire and thank them, that they got rid of the Jews for us."</sentence><sentence id="5787">And he was a Polish patriot.</sentence><sentence id="5788">But this was very important, he got rid of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5789">So this is the different <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- I say <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5790">See, when it comes the Fourth of July, I hang out a flag.</sentence><sentence id="5791">I am the only one on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to hang out the flag.</sentence><sentence id="5792">And the reason why I hang out the flag, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, if I</sentence><sentence id="5794">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0052 150 didn't hang out the flag, the police came, gave me a fine.</sentence><sentence id="5795">Here,
