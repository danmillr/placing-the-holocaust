<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: What was the test?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: When you worked for the government in exile, what were your duties and responsibilities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Well obviously I came in at very low levels, but I was a bilingual secretary.</sentence><sentence id="103">Of course I -- since I left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, since I left the school system in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> at the age of 13, my expertise in the language was very limited.</sentence><sentence id="104">But -- and so I'm -- but I suppose able to obvi -- obviously speak fluently and I was required in the Czech government to write and to work in Czech.</sentence><sentence id="105">And I was brought up in the <span class="BUILDING">Slovak schools</span>, so I still hadn't learned the Czech when I got into the government, but I managed to get through.</sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know, one does the best one can and survives.</sentence><sentence id="107">And people were very ha -- friendly and -- and people helped.</sentence><sentence id="108">And so what I did was mostly Czech correspondence and also I did subtitles for films.</sentence><sentence id="109">I did the -- what do you call it?The little te -- the translations, you know, I typed those for Czech films, in Czech.</sentence><sentence id="110">And I did Czech and English correspondence.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: I think it was -- I would have to look it up but I -- I can't remember exactly.</sentence><sentence id="130">I think it must have been in deg44, 1944, maybe a little earlier, because I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1939.</sentence><sentence id="131">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sussex</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> for a year, then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for another year.</sentence><sentence id="132">And I worked for one year at [indecipherable] at the <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span>, and then I worked -- it must have been foy -- deg39 - "40 -- deg40 -- I would imagine deg43 - "44 I started working for the Czech government.</sentence><sentence id="133">But I could easily look it up later and tell you, okay?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: With whom did you work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Well most -- of course obviously I -- I -- all these people were refugees.</sentence><sentence id="142">I -- one -- I mean, I know that the minister -- Meyer, who was minister, I did not work with him.</sentence><sentence id="143">He was head of the whole thing, I hardly ever saw him.</sentence><sentence id="144">I can't remember the people's names, but I do have -- I would ha -- I have it written somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="145">There were different people, I mean economists, politicians, I mean, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="146">I worked for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Ministry of Finance, Industry and Commerce.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: I was, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="182">I really didn't at that time.</sentence><sentence id="183">Because first of all, we were really in a very -- let's say it was sort of like in a state of shock, let's put it that way.</sentence><sentence id="184">And we were sort of barely managing to exist anyway, because we were trying to make a living.</sentence><sentence id="185">We lived through the London blitz, we didn't -- I mean, we had to concentrate on survival, on surviving and we were terribly afraid of what's go -- what's going on in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="186">We heard terrible things but we didn't want to believe it because we were very frightened for our family.</sentence><sentence id="187">And we just lived from day to day and we were mostly together with refugees, other refugees.</sentence><sentence id="188">And of course we were just -- were not integrated into the British world.</sentence><sentence id="189">And what happened was that we lived, at first -- I mean, I don't know exactly the dates, but I would -- I would be able to look them up because I kept all the papers, but we n -- at first we lived in a chur -- when we -- after -- after we left the ho -- <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span>, we lived in another <span class="BUILDING">girls" home</span> run by a ger -- German refugee woman.</sentence><sentence id="190">And we were four girls to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then we lived -- my sister and another friend and I lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> rented from another -- in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from another refugee, a lady.</sentence><sentence id="191">And we socialized mostly with other refugees.</sentence><sentence id="192">In the evenings we got together with other refugees and we just talked about our s -- but we had some very good times together, too, we had good social evenings, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">We went dancing, we had it -- we were very close together because we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">But we were not included in the life of the British, and especially not in Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="195">I don't remember that we have ever been invited to a Jewish holiday, to a family.</sentence><sentence id="196">I don't think of -- I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="197">I can't remember that we ever had a Seder in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="198">So we just sort of s-sat around waiting for</sentence><sentence id="200">the end of the war because we thought we would -- we were very anxious for the war to end so that we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: In your previous interview, you mentioned that there was some anti-Semitism in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

[</sentence><sentence id="271">phone ringing]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Let me stop for just one moment, we have a disturbance. [</sentence><sentence id="273">tape break] Okay, we're back.</sentence><sentence id="274">I'm sorry for that interruption.</sentence><sentence id="275">I had asked you if you had experienced any anti-Semitism with respect to your work for the government in exile.</sentence><sentence id="276">Did you experience any anti-Semitism any time while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes, actually, we did, and the -- we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> for five years.</sentence><sentence id="278">We lived there as long as they allowed us to live there, because after five years we had to move.</sentence><sentence id="279">But especially during the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, people were very anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="280">I mean, there was one woman in particular that used to make remarks which were very painful to me.</sentence><sentence id="281">But otherwise the matron and the rest of the people were not Jewish -- I mean we were the only Jewish girl -- as far as I know we were the only Jewish -- three Jewish girls at the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">And I don't remember that</sentence><sentence id="284">there was any anti-Semitism except one or two people were anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="285">But of course, they were careful when we were around, they didn't say much.</sentence><sentence id="286">But one person was very outspoken.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: What kinds of things did she say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Oh, she was very angry about what happened with Bernadotte, when he was assassinated, and she f -- said some terrible -- I mean, she had said very painful things which were very pr -- very painful to me because I felt, since we experienced so much anti-Semitism at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and since what was going on in Europe, and then we are experiencing it in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, I felt very disillusioned, but you know, that kind -- that was the only one, as far as I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: Was there any public rush -- recognition in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> of the existence of the Jewish brigade in the British army?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Not that I know -- I mean, I did -- I wasn't aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="320">But because we were very pat- patriotic, we knew about the Czech army, we knew about all the other armies, but I didn't know about the Jewish brigade.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Did you follow the local BBC broadcasts and the local newspapers regularly during the war years?</sentence></p></dialogue>

immediately after the war.</sentence><sentence id="542">Well, they knew they couldn't wait fast enough -- to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> fast enough, so many of them, many of the people I worked with and many of the people who belonged to the [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at the time who were -- I was with a lot, immediately packed up and went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">That was -- also included people like Madeline Albright's father and the family went back immediately after the

honestly didn't think I was able to do this job.</sentence><sentence id="557">It was -- and he wouldn't take no for an answer.</sentence><sentence id="558">I mean, not to me, I -- as I said, I had never been in touch but directly to my superiors.</sentence><sentence id="559">And he said I have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="560">And I said no, I couldn't do it, I just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="561">I was too inexperienced and I was too young and I was too afraid of it.</sentence><sentence id="562">And I said, no I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="563">And they said yes, you will have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="564">So I was assigned to work with them, and I went to work with them.</sentence><sentence id="565">There are 15 of them here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and it worked out very well, of course.</sentence><sentence id="566">I mean, there are -- it was very good.</sentence><sentence id="567">In fact, one of them said to me, don't -- why -- would you like to come and work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>?</sentence><sentence id="568">And I said -- I didn't know much about the <span class="BUILDING">International Monetary Fund</span>, nor did I know anything about the <span class="BUILDING">World Bank</span> and I asked him which organization I should apply for and he told me well, he liked the International Monetary Fund better.</sentence><sentence id="569">And so I was sent for a test, and I didn't take it seriously, I thought I would take a test just to see how I would do, for my own benefit.</sentence><sentence id="570">And I took the test and I just forgot completely about the whole thing, never thought about it again.</sentence><sentence id="571">I never expected that I would be offered this job.</sentence><sentence id="572">But then, in March 1948, when the communists took over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day and</sentence><sentence id="574">6 on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> was a letter recalling me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="575">So all of us who were then working for the Czech government were asked to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> immediately by the communist government.</sentence><sentence id="576">As soon as I opened the letter, I said, that's the end of my career with the international -- with the Czech government, because I wasn't going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, to the Czech -- under the communists.</sentence><sentence id="577">And I left -- I asked my boss that morning to -- whether I could go and take the morning off, and I took off and started -- went looking for another job.</sentence><sentence id="578">And I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> late in the afternoon having found a new job.</sentence><sentence id="579">And when I got back there was a message from my sister to say that I have a letter from International Monetary Fund.</sentence><sentence id="580">It was -- the whole thing happened the very same day.</sentence><sentence id="581">The Czech government recalled me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="582">I found a new job the same moment and in the afternoon I had the letter offering me an appointment with the International Monetary Fund.</sentence><sentence id="583">I was shock, absolutely shock because I never expected to be hire by the International Monetary Fund in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and I didn't really want to come, because I didn't want to -- by this time I had settled down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> quite comfortably.</sentence><sentence id="584">My sisters were there, my friends were there and I wasn't going to go by myself to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to start a new job.</sentence><sentence id="585">And I just didn't want to do it.</sentence><sentence id="586">So I said, oh no, I can't believe that I got this job, I don't want it.</sentence><sentence id="587">But then I thought to myself, if I don't go -- if I don't go I'll never forgive myself, I have to try.</sentence><sentence id="588">And so I immediately cabled back to the managing director because they liked -- because since only high level people were hired from abroad, not at my level, and a letter was signed by the managing director and I cabled back -- I cabled back to the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, appointment accepted, which I laughed about for years afterwards, because I thought it was so funny.</sentence><sentence id="589">When I came to the <span class="BUILDING">fund</span> I realized that it was a funny response on my part to a managing director to say appointment accepted.</sentence><sentence id="590">But in any case, I did accept appointment for the simple reason that I thought we've got to get on with our lives.</sentence><sentence id="591">IfI</sentence><sentence id="593">7 don't leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> my sister, my older sister will never get -- leave us, we'll all live together, she'll never marry and I have to break up the trio.</sentence><sentence id="594">So I decided to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but I only was going to leave for one year.</sentence><sentence

wasn't sure about the pol -- about the communist -- what was going -- you know, how it will be.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And it was just really frightening to me to go back, but Peter said no, we

was so disappointed because I had not been in touch with her since 1939, but I felt she would be the only person I could think of that I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1814">And so then we decided to go and look at -- at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="1815">And I couldn't recognize it, it was so run down.</sentence><sentence id="1816">The entire

be?</sentence><sentence id="1832">Because I said I lived there, so she knew exactly in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she was living.</sentence><sentence id="1833">That was 1939, this was 1968, 30 years later.</sentence><sentence id="1834">And so we went up there and of course I looked -- and she said that two families lived downstairs [indecipherable] lived upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And they -- and I couldn't find one stick of anything that belonged to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1836">There was nothing that was
