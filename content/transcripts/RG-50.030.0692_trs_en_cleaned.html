<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: What was that step-up like, to step up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bi-plane</span> into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">monoplane</span>?</sentence><sentence id="523">Was it a huge experience?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: Yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span>, and then I went to (?</sentence><sentence id="562">Molta?),</sentence><sentence id="563"><span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span>, and we flew <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">AT-6s</span>, which was the Texan -- had anickname, "the Texan."</sentence><sentence id="564">Again, more advanced, more controls, retractable gear.</sentence><sentence id="565">We had flaps.</sentence><sentence id="566">We had -- each one became a little bit more of achallenge.</sentence><sentence id="567">But it was not like learning everything at once.</sentence><sentence id="568">From primary to basic to advanced, each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> was a little bit morecomplex.</sentence><sentence id="569">And we did -- I think it was the first time Ididanight flight.</sentence><sentence id="570">Up to that we had never done any night flying.</sentence><sentence id="571">And in all these <span class="BUILDING">flying schools</span> we did all kinds of manoeuvres.</sentence><sentence id="572">We learned instrument flying.</sentence><sentence id="573">Put a-- hada hood put over our heads so we see nothing but thecontrols in front of us.</sentence><sentence id="574">And the instructor was still with us, he could see what we were doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="589">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="591">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="592">So we learned instrument flying where you've got to rely on your instruments.</sentence><sentence id="593">You can get very disoriented.</sentence><sentence id="594">If you do some manoeuvres, your ear kicks off and you -- sometimes you can't see anything.</sentence><sentence id="595">You don't know if you're right side up, sideways, you don't know if you're losingaltitude or gaining altitude.</sentence><sentence id="596">So each step along the way became more complex.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="603">Q: Was it frightening?</sentence><sentence id="604">Flying blind, you know, with that hood over?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="607">A: It -- [didn't find it difficult.</sentence><sentence id="608">We had some time in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Link Trainers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="609">Do you know what a Link Trainer is?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Link Trainer</span> is a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that's in a stationary position where I'm in there, you'retelling me what to do, and you have a_ showing me what I'm doing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="616">It's away to learn blind flying without being in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="617">He'd basically tell you what to do and you'd do it.</sentence><sentence id="618">And you're just looking at -- you got to rely on instruments, you can't rely on your ear andstuff like that when you're learning to fly.</sentence><sentence id="619">You got to believe the altimeter, the artificial horizon, the RPMs that the motor's -- you got to rely on your instruments because you can't always see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="625">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: So throughout this entire process from basic training, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avon</span>, to going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macon</span>, to going on to the AT-6, blind cockpit training, what haveyou, what length of time are we talking abouthere, this entire time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: Two-month intervals.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: They're cramming a lot into a short period of time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="639">I went from not flying to six months later I'm a pilot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="645">All our training was in two-month intervals.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Up to and through the AT-6 training, is there any training involving combat engagement up tothat point or is it purely flying at that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: At advance training we did some aerial gunnery.</sentence><sentence id="651">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that towed a big target and we shot at that.</sentence><sentence id="652">We had to be fairly proficient because they'd count the <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="653">Anumber of us would be shooting at -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">AT-6</span> was the first aircraftthat we had a gun, and our ammo was painted, the projectile.</sentence><sentence id="654">So if we shot at the target, as it went through the screen it left yellow or red, so that when you dropped the target you could seewhat your proficiency was in aerial gunnery.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="663">So we did that in advanced training.</sentence><sentence id="664">Advanced training was the first time we flew acombat-type <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">Part of our training was to go down to <span class="BUILDING">Avon Field</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, and they had P-40s and we flew a P-40.</sentence><sentence id="666">That's the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> I ever flew with no dual time.</sentence><sentence id="667">Just sat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, looked where all the instruments were and took it off.</sentence><sentence id="668">No training whatsoever on -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-40</span> was the old war hawk that was _ used, basically, in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="669">A very powerful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> but sort of obsolete by World War II standards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="678">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="680">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="682">Q: But, still, what was that first experience like, getting into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-40</span>, no real exposure to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> before, going up in it, what was the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: It was scary.</sentence><sentence id="684">Because when you put the throttle forward, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> moved and it was very manoeuvrable, but -- I don't know, it was exiting.</sentence><sentence id="685">It got your blood going like mad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: At what point during your training did you realise that you had been slotted and selected specifically for fighter pilot training?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: Oh, it was in the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="694">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="695">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="696">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="697">I knew when I started flying that -- well, probably basically at advanced they made up their mind you were capable of being a combat pilot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="704">How long did you spend with the P-40?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Probably less than 10 hours.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="709">Q: And then on to what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: Then Icame <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on leave.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="767">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="768">It seemed pretty natural.</sentence><sentence id="769">Because I had flown the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-40</span>, which was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter aircraft</span> but sort of obsolete.</sentence><sentence id="770">Went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tallahassee</span> -- and, again, it's a single enginefighter, there's no dual time.</sentence><sentence id="771">You sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cockpit</span>, you learn where all the instruments are, you know where all the controls are to pick up the wheels, the flaps and everything you need to know, and just go ahead and fly it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
