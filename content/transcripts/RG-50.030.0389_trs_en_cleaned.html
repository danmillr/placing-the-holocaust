<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1801">Q: Okay, okay, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1805">A: Well, that was an extremely hard time for me.</sentence><sentence id="1806">In the morning, the di -- the children changed their clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1807">They had clothes that belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">daycare center</span>, and they had to be washed.</sentence><sentence id="1808">So one of my jobs at one time was to wash clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1809">Now, there's no harm in this, if somebody tells you how to wash clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1810">I can only advise you never to wash clothes like that.</sentence><sentence id="1811">I didn't have any more skin on my fingers.</sentence><sentence id="1812">I mean, my life has been saved, so I'm not complaining, I'm just telling you.</sentence><sentence id="1813">In the morning my -- my fingers were all raw.</sentence><sentence id="1814">I couldn't hardly do this, but I had to wash washing again.</sentence><sentence id="1815">Do the washing again.</sentence><sentence id="1816">For some reason which is not understandable, we're not given enough food.</sentence><sentence id="1817">Not because there wasn't enough food, but because, I suppose, the matron, and the sister learned at some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or other, you give so many grams of these vegetable, so many grams of that vegetable, and so many grams of meat.</sentence><sentence id="1818">I suppose that must be the case.</sentence><sentence id="1819">And you didn't help yourself, you're -- just like David Copperfield, it was put on your plate, like this.</sentence><sentence id="1820">I was always hungry there.</sentence><sentence id="1821">Now, the other fellow nurses -- trainees, were also hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1822">But they went into the larder in the evening, secretly, and took whatever they needed to satisfy their hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1823">They didn't take me with them, but they said afterwards when it was found out, that it was me who had taken the food.</sentence><sentence id="1824">I mean, that sort of thing I've never encountered in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1825">I was taught sort of, one stuck together.</sentence><sentence id="1826">I would have gone with them, I would have helped myself too, I was never a -- my English was as good as non- existent [indecipherable] in those days, and yes, I remember there was -- we were sleeping all together, 10 or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1827">And I had a drawing which I very much liked, and I took with me, my drawing teacher did that.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And I put it with -- I put it on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> with pins -- with -- and every morning it was found taken down.</sentence><sentence id="1829">Now, I wouldn't, if I live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where there -- a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where there's a <span class="DLF">wall</span>, I wouldn't advise anybody to do this either, but I would have talked to the girl, and said don't -- please don't pin it up, makes <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1830">But it's just taken down, and -- and that sort of -- those sort of things were very bad to take.</sentence><sentence id="1831">And I had -- I remember very clearly that I had to take care of 25 children who had a rest after lunch.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And they were supposed to close their eyes and sleep, if possible, but at least keep quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1833">Well, under my care they didn't keep quiet, and I didn't know how to ke -- let them -- how to manage to keep them quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1834">So I shouted at them, and I remember very clearly that I always said, "Shut your eyeses."</sentence><sentence id="1835">Which was a great success in the way of humoring them, and they thought it was very funny indeed.</sentence><sentence id="1836">So that was a -- and I remember more.</sentence><sentence id="1837">I remember that every two weeks -- it could have been every week, there was no reason why half of the trainees stayed over, and the other could leave for the weekend.</sentence><sentence id="1838">But however -- before every -- before that half which had the weekend off could leave, the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> had to be cleaned, washed.</sentence><sentence id="1839">Now, after awhile I realize if I just throw water over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, that'll do nicely, and get us off quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1840">But I had thought that cleaning the <span class="NPIP">place</span> means taking off whatever dirt.</sentence><sentence id="1841">So it took me -- I'm always -- I've always been slow, it took me ages to get it, and the others couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="1842">So that didn't -- couldn't leave until everything was finished.</sentence><sentence id="1843">So that -- that didn't make me much more popular either.</sentence><sentence id="1844">On the other hand, there was a party at -- which wasn't very far, the people, Stevenson, I lived -- I had -- they had brought me over, didn't live very far.</sentence><sentence id="1845">They had a party, and there was cake left over.</sentence><sentence id="1846">And the rest of the cake was brought to me.</sentence><sentence id="1847">I had a chauffer at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1848">It never occurred to me, I wasn't brought up that way, it never occurred to me when I had the cake, not to vide it -- divide it among everybody in equal parts.</sentence><sentence id="1849">So everybody had something, but they didn't take me into the larder with them.</sentence><sentence id="1850">One of the things that had to be done to be a children's nurse 1 one day, is to knit -- to knit something for a child.</sentence><sentence id="1851">Well, I would never finished it, because there was always some -- something wrong with it, and I have to try -- like Penelope, I always say to -- to [indecipherable] again, and start all over again.</sentence><sentence id="1852">I would never meant -- made it.</sentence><sentence id="1853">That war broke out in September, and the -- the children were evacuated, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> closed down.</sentence><sentence id="1854">So I went back to those -- to family Stevenson, and thought I was lucky, but then my hard time really started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
