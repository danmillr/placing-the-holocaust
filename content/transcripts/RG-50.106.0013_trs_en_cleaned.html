but there we were, and I think we left, maybe sailed the next morning and took us five days to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and -- and that --I believe we were waiting for the --when was D-Day?</sentence><sentence id="325">Do you remember what day that was?</sentence><sentence id="326">I think we were waiting for --no, I guess it was the Battle of The Bulge or something.</sentence><sentence id="327">We were waiting for some real heavy activity to loosen up a little so that we could cross the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">Stayed there a few days and then we started --</sentence><sentence id="330">and then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> I know one time another nurse and I and a doctor and a couple of corpsmen were sent to somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">At that time everything was "somewhere."</sentence><sentence id="332">No <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> could be listed or anything so this was somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which from --and that from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> is a very, very short distance, and we went in one little old --one little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army ambulance</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="333">Of course it had been a blackout, and that was quite a trip because the --in a complete blackout, and they had --I guess--I don't know how they ran that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> but must have been very dim lights, so you could see a little bit but not much "cause anyway they came to a --a huge crater, bomb crater in the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and the driver had to stop just short of that because he didn't have lights, he couldn't see, but he knew there was something there, and he got out--and he flashed --you had to flash your flashlights down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">Never up or out but down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and I remember him flashing that around to see how big the crater was so he could go around it; and down in a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> by the <span class="DLF">road</span> we heard these flashes of lights and heard some kind of firing, some kind of skirmishing down there, and we finally reached our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">Then the next morning we were really balled out for having come because it was so dangerous, but our commanding officer hadn't known that.</sentence><sentence id="336">Somehow the communications hadn't been so good so we got to this --where we were detached to this very small outfit, and they needed --they just needed help so badly.</sentence><sentence id="337">That's why we were detached there, and they had a lot of German wounded too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Now, was this your first nursing activity?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="939">Q: Well, it's hard to know what it would have been like if you hadn't have done that "cause--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="940">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="941">May have been the very same.</sentence><sentence id="942">Who knows but it was an experience that you could well do without.</sentence><sentence id="943">I had a woman one time tell me that she didn't think it ever happened, and I don't know why she said that.</sentence><sentence id="944">We weren't talking about it, but she said that she didn't believe that there were ever any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="945">She thought that was a lot of propaganda, and I--I'm thinking you're talking to the wrong person, and she talked quite a bit about it until I finally just stopped her and told her whatever --I don't remember what I told her, but anyhow I told her the truth.</sentence><sentence id="946">I was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="947">That shocked me as much as anything probably to think that somebody --she was older than I, so she had been through --in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="948">She had known what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="949">I mean she had heard --she had to have heard.</sentence><sentence id="950">No way she could have avoided newspapers, radios, what was going on, and yet she thought that was all propaganda.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="968">Q: How did she take it when you told her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="970">A: Well, I felt that she didn't believe a word of it.</sentence><sentence id="971">Then not long ago, I met a woman and she was -- and I don't --I don't know why the subject came up, but she was telling me that her father-in-law --I don't know, someone, someone in her family did not believe it ever happened.</sentence><sentence id="972">Was propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="973">So again someone else didn't believe it, and then I --that makes me believe there might be a lot of people that believe this never happened, therefore, the story has to be told, has to be kept because I can't imagine there'd be anyone who would think it hadn't happened.</sentence><sentence id="974">I know they're teaching it in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> today, and there --they --I think they're teaching it--quite a bit about it, and yet there are those who don't believe, and I can't --apparently they don't want to believe it.</sentence><sentence id="975">Why don't they want to believe?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="992">Q: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="993">Hard to --it's hard to understand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: So do you think if these people--those people who do not believe would go through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span>, they'd still not believe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
