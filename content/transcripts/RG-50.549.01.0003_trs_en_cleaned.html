<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">So on his way back, he stopped off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he stayed for about a weekend there and when he left he asked me to marry him.</sentence><sentence id="2">And | wasn't sure, you know, | mean, you know | wasn't so sure | wanted to go off to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and | wasn't so sure | wanted to marry him.</sentence><sentence id="3">But on, when he got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, he went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on his way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to be debriefed and he saw Jim and he told Jim.</sentence><sentence id="4">Actually he didn't tell him he was going to marry me, but he told him that he had spent time with me and that | might come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, because what happened was | said, "Well, I'm not so sure | want to get married."</sentence><sentence id="5">And he was looking for other ways and we had started applications for a Fullbright for me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">So he told Jim that | might come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> on a Fullbright and when Jim heard that, he sold his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, he took his money and he came back to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="7">And about three weeks later we were married.</sentence><sentence id="8">So that's how it happened, that | met Jim, | got married and from then on my life in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was finished and | was moving to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">So | came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a bride of an American, who knew very little English and who had to find her way again in a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">| must say it was a challenge, it took me a couple of years to, to really get the better of it.</sentence><sentence id="11">But | had to get a job right away and | gota very good job with a, a <span class="BUILDING">French government office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">French film office</span>, which was a very glamorous job, everybody envied me because | was receptionist, but | was also squiring around the French movie stars when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for the release of their pictures, so it was a very glamorous job | had.</sentence><sentence id="12">And Jim worked for <span class="BUILDING">NBC</span> and we had about four single years like that, where we really, | really got to enjoy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and learn the language and you know, and try to fit myself in to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">And then we had a child after four years, Laura, our daughter, who is 35 now and we moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">Actually we moved to another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">| really got used to living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">And then we had a son and after we had two children we decided we better buy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so we bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on <span class="REGION">Long Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">| have to explain when I'm saying we bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it seems like a landmark.</sentence><sentence id="18">All my friends wanted <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, | didn't want a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because | never wanted possessions because it scared me to own things.</sentence><sentence id="19">So it took Jim awhile to talk me into for us to move into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">But eventually | realized that he was right, you know, with two children you don't live in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, it's nicer to have a <span class="DLF">yard</span> and to have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span> and such.</sentence><sentence id="21">So we moved into a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> and the children started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">By then Laura started <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> and Eric pretty soon started <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>, where | think | spent more time than he did because | was very often a volunteer there and lived the American suburban life, you know and that was again a different kind of life | tried to fit myself into.</sentence><sentence id="23">So first | was working and then | was a mother and then at one point, Jim had an idea for a publication, an index to congressional documents and for that we had to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">So here we</sentence><sentence id="26">were with two small children, two young children, packed up everything and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to start a new project.</sentence><sentence id="27">And Jim made it perfectly clear that he couldn't do it on his own, | had to be part of it, | had to be his partner.</sentence><sentence id="28">So | had two small children and for a period of 10 years | managed to somehow to be a mother and a homemaker and a cook and also at the same time, create a system for, by which we collected documents on Capital Hill, made contacts in every committee, learned my way around the American government, including what it does and how to best bring on the control of this unwieldy output of paper that the American government produces.</sentence><sentence id="29">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="30">We started a very successful business together and we run that business creating indexes for research and <span class="BUILDING">academic libraries</span>, which are extremely valuable.</sentence><sentence id="31">And we run that company for about 10 years and then we sold it, we sold it to a Dutch company, Elsoveer(ph), but the company's still going on and most of the people we hired are still there, hired and trained.</sentence><sentence id="32">First | started doing the, the set up of the system on <span class="DLF">Capital Hill</span> on how to collect all those documents and when that was under control, | put two people in charge of that and then | had to come in because by then we had lots of people working for us and Jim was the creative man, doing the indexing and the dealing with computers, but somebody had to take care of personnel and administration because at one point we were each 300 people, so that was a large business and it needed ... so | came in and | took over administration personnel and | created salary administration systems which I'd, | only stayed one step ahead because | would take seminars and then decide, you know, how we needed to do it and administration, we had a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> by then, producing microfiche and | was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> also, which employed about 75 people, which was out in Rockville(ph) Excuse me. (</sentence><sentence id="33">pause).</sentence><sentence id="34">Okay, so where did we stop, yes, so we were running this very large business and | was in charge of personnel and administration in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> and Jim was in charge of the editorial end of it and after 10 years we sold the company.</sentence><sentence id="35">It was an unusual company, was one of the first of information retrieval companies that we had created and was an extremely valuable company and it made Wall Street history, because of, you know, of the era it sort of brought in to the United States business world.</sentence><sentence id="36">We were extremely proud of that company because not only did we create tools which were very valuable for researchers in academic places, but also it became a tool for <span class="BUILDING">law offices</span>, there isn't a <span class="BUILDING">law office</span> that doesn't have our index, when they used to create legislative histories, | don't know if they still need it as badly, but there was a long period of time where a <span class="BUILDING">law office</span> couldn't operate without our index because that told them immediately what was going on on <span class="DLF">Capital Hill</span>, to follow through a piece of legislation, from the various stages, with all it's documents, you know, attached to it and whereas they used to have to employ people with long hours to create those histories, they, from us they could do it almost immediately with our tools.</sentence><sentence id="37">So it was not only a profitable company, but it was a useful thing to have created.</sentence><sentence id="38">And we also ran a very unusual</sentence><sentence id="40"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, in terms of our employees could buy stock, they owned part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">We felt it's much better to share and to have employees, you know, who were loyal to a company because it was partly theirs and also we started one of the first practices of flex time for women with children, where they could work only part-time, you know, as a consequence we got much better workers.</sentence><sentence id="42">Many intelligent women didn't want to take full-time jobs because they had young children at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that gave them an opportunity to do intellectual work and still have flexible hours.</sentence><sentence id="43">So we were sort of ___in many social ways too.</sentence><sentence id="44">At this point, did you want me to continue in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> or do you want me to go back a little bit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence><sentence id="45">You wanted to ask a few questions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Yeah, | wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: And tell me, did you meet up with survivors when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: No, no, because I, | stepped into Jim's kind of life.</sentence><sentence id="98">Jim worked for <span class="BUILDING">NBC</span>, | worked for, for a company on <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span>, you know, a <span class="BUILDING">French office</span> and most of the people we saw were Jim's friends or the people we made friends with at work.</sentence><sentence id="99">By and large it was a crowd of reporters, television people, radio people, you know.</sentence><sentence id="100">Advertising people and mostly people like that and maybe some people whom Jim had known as a child, because in fact | had met a couple of, of people he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with and | became extremely friendly with one young woman who had gone to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with him, who stayed my best friend until she died a couple of years ago, you know, they lived in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>, but that was a couple who was extremely close to us.</sentence><sentence id="101">So | started making friends amongst the Americans, but | did not see any survivors.</sentence><sentence id="102">| don't think survivors search out other survivors.</sentence><sentence id="103">| think, particularly in my case, | wanted a normal life and | wanted to step into a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="104">| didn't want to live in the past, | didn't want to talk about what happened to me and in fact | very seldom talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="105">Most of our friends didn't know | was a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="106">As far as they knew | cam from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and that was it, | was learning the language, | was learning the customs, | was becoming Americanized, but they did not know | was a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="107">In fact Jim knew very little about it, he knew, but | never talked about it and he didn't quiz me about it, so | very seldom talked about it and | did not search out any other Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="108">However, a very funny thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="109">Jim was very politically inclined always and | began to get, to take an interest in politics and we went to a Stevenson rally once in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span>, a huge rally and | looked across the <span class="BUILDING">arena</span> and | saw a young girl and | said, | know this person, | knew her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">So we went up and | said, "Are you Blanca(ph)?</sentence><sentence id="111">Blanca Bruner(ph)?"</sentence><sentence id="112">and she said yes.</sentence><sentence id="113">| hadn't seen her in like what, 10, 11 years and she was just as amazed as | was that | had recognized and she recognized me too, so we sort of started contact and | wanted to see her and</sentence><sentence id="115">she called me up and she told me that her father forbade her to see me.</sentence><sentence id="116">And | said, "Why?</sentence><sentence id="117">He doesn't know me."</sentence><sentence id="118">And she said, "yes, that's just it.".</sentence><sentence id="119">They were very Orthodox Jews and they didn't mix with any other Jews and she was not allowed to see me.</sentence><sentence id="120">So the only one | could have had contact with, her father cut it off, he absolutely forbade her to see me, because | was not a practicing Orthodox Jew.</sentence><sentence id="121">So that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="122">So to answer your question, | did not see any Holocaust survivors, | did not talk about it very often, | didn't read about it.</sentence><sentence id="123">| really concentrated all my energies on adapting myself to a normal life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and | think | succeeded pretty well, so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Did you ever, at any point, feel that you were missing something, or was it just kind of, you just wanted to put that in the past.</sentence><sentence id="153">Was there a part of you that was curious, wanted that sort of bond or was it lonely?</sentence><sentence id="154">| was just ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Yes, there were times when it was lonely, but it was also amusing, like | would have a friend who would sit over coffee with me and cry that she had an identity crisis and here | was, | didn't know my name, | didn't know my age, | didn't know where | came from and | felt, well, I'm not any worse off then she is.</sentence><sentence id="159">She's having an identity crisis?</sentence><sentence id="160">| don't think, you know, | don't think I'm any worse off.</sentence><sentence id="161">At least | don't know, you know, it's a clean slate.</sentence><sentence id="162">So yes, | did feel at times lonely, because nobody | knew could share with me what I'd gone through, but at the same time | thought, it gave me a certain perspective where more trivial things didn't bother me the same way as they seemed to bother my friends, okay?</sentence><sentence id="163">Many of them were bothered that they didn't have, they were hoping that their careers would have been more advanced and they were busy at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the kids and they couldn't do this and they couldn't do that and they were very bothered.</sentence><sentence id="164">It didn't bother me to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the kids.</sentence><sentence id="165">It's true that | worked until the kids were born.</sentence><sentence id="166">| tried, | had a very good job when | was pregnant with Laura and | would have liked to go back to it, but by then | was working for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and | had a very good job.</sentence><sentence id="167">| was working for the ambassador from <span class="COUNTRY">Laos</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, you know, one of the IndoChinese countries, French speaking.</sentence><sentence id="168">| had a very good job, | mean | worked until two weeks before she was born and they wanted me back and | started negotiating and they wanted me full time and | knew | couldn't walk out of there at five o'clock and yet | had a child and | couldn't see myself leaving the child, so | decided not to work.</sentence><sentence id="169">So | made the decision voluntarily and | somehow didn't feel that | was being penalized in any way.</sentence><sentence id="170">So | had advantages that others didn't have, in a way.</sentence><sentence id="171">And then, before | even had time to turn around and feel that oh my goodness, what am | going to do with my life now that the children are going to start <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Jim said, "We are starting a business."</sentence><sentence id="172">And so when my son went off to <span class="BUILDING">Kindergarten</span> for half a day, | went off to work.</sentence><sentence id="173">In fact | had to rush back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to greet him because he only had half a day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">So | never had some of the problems that | could see my friends had.</sentence><sentence id="175">| had my set of problems because | had</sentence><sentence id="177">hang-ups because of my past, you know.</sentence><sentence id="178">Bult, like for instance, you know, taking care of the children, | was always very concerned that they should not catch cold and when they were sick | felt sick and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="179">I'm sure that my <span class="COUNTRY">American</span> counterparts didn't feel that to the same degree as | did.</sentence><sentence id="180">The anxiety over children, particularly.</sentence><sentence id="181">But on the other hand, they had other anxieties which | didn't have, so | felt I'm not doing too badly, okay, so that's how | felt about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: You said earlier, in another interview, that you didn't tell your children, so?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: No, | thought that and | think probably | made a mistake, because | didn't speak about it, they knew | was foreign, yeah | was French, but then, when our kids were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, there were several kids in classes that my daughter had, who had French parents, so that wasn't an oddity, that much of an oddity for her and | didn't feel | wanted to burden them.</sentence><sentence id="210">First of all, | felt uncomfortable myself talking about it and secondly | was very concerned not to overburden the children.</sentence><sentence id="211">So | didn't talk about it and it's only when our daughter was going to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, she came back, want to stop it?</sentence><sentence id="212">She came back one day and apparently they had been discussing the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="213">You know there was a period where the Holocaust wasn't discussed to the same degree that it is being discussed now.</sentence><sentence id="214">There is an awareness now which | don't think existed at the time when | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">And she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> and she asked me am | a Holocaust survivor and | said, "yes."</sentence><sentence id="216">And she was so upset. "</sentence><sentence id="217">Why didn't you ever tell me anything about it, why didn't you say anything about it?"</sentence><sentence id="218">And | realized that | had made a mistake, she was truly upset.</sentence><sentence id="219">And from then on she just kept on digging and asking questions and this and that and | realized that | had to do an about face and face the past and come to terms with it myself, but particularly for the sake of my children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: How old were you at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well, let's see, Laura was born when | was 25 and at that point she must have been 11.</sentence><sentence id="234">About 36, 37.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: How did you, in your own way, come to terms with it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: | started reading about it, because | started, | started to, trying to put some chronological order into my memories.</sentence><sentence id="240">And that's when | started talking to Jim, but mostly to female friends, | had always very close female friends.</sentence><sentence id="241">| had a couple in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who were very close to me.</sentence><sentence id="242">And so when | was ready to talk, they were listening, you know and they were always ready to listen, so | would discuss certain matters.</sentence><sentence id="243">And with Jim, too and try to put some chronological order into my memories.</sentence><sentence id="244">At that point, Jim became very helpful because he started getting me books and | would tell him recollections and then he would find books and he would</sentence><sentence id="246">say, "Your recollections are correct."</sentence><sentence id="247">Like | would have recollections about what happened in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> after we escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he found a book, | don't remember what it is, we have a library of them by now.</sentence><sentence id="248">And sure enough, it described almost the way | had described to him what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="249">Those bands, you know, of deserters and Jewish people hiding and children and this and that and it was very accurate, so | knew that my memory wasn't playing tricks.</sentence><sentence id="250">That's the way | was trying to, you know, to deal with the, and | was able to sort of make some order out of what had happened, by talking about it and then reading up and confirming that my memories were actually accurate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Did you ever join, were there survivor groups, did you ever, after that experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, did you meet up with anyone?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="266">As a matter of fact | have a very good friend who lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, who is also a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="267">She had a somewhat different <span class="DLF">path</span> than mine, in that she was with her mother and her brother all through it, and then emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">When they left Europe, they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span>, so she is sort of Latin American in her outlook because she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and then she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and she called me once that there was a group of hidden children that was meeting and | should join them and | wasn't ready.</sentence><sentence id="269">| just absolutely refused.</sentence><sentence id="270">She went to this meeting, they had written, they wrote a book, somebody at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, | think a woman at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, who does a lot of research in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, put together a book of the recollections of the hidden children and my friend was part of it and she sent me the book.</sentence><sentence id="271">You know, | read her part, | couldn't read the others.</sentence><sentence id="272">| just didn't feel | wanted to go back and dwell on it.</sentence><sentence id="273">| just couldn't read the others.</sentence><sentence id="274">And so | understood that | really wasn't ready to join that group and to share in great detail and just dwell that much.</sentence><sentence id="275">That's not my, my nature.</sentence><sentence id="276">My nature is to look <span class="NPIP">ahead</span> and | can't look, | only looked back as far as | needed to to put some order into it and to sort of present it to my children.</sentence><sentence id="277">But!</sentence><sentence id="278">don't think | want to dwell any more on that than that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: When you say dwell, is it some of the pain and the experience of it that scares you to go back?</sentence><sentence id="294">Describe sort of what's going on in your head.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Well, of course there's pain.</sentence><sentence id="298">There's pain, there's fear, you know, there's an enormous amount of fear and you start thinking of how, what a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> the world is and it's very hard to get up in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="299">In fact | had that experience when the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> opened and my husband Jim thought that it would be a good idea if we went together with our children.</sentence><sentence id="300">By then both our children were married, so there were six of us going over there.</sentence><sentence id="301">| think for my kids it was a good experience.</sentence><sentence id="302">For me, | came back and it did something.</sentence><sentence id="303">For a week | couldn't function.</sentence><sentence id="304">| couldn't get up in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="305">And | didn't really know why, except | kept on crying and | was having myself a depression, which | am not prone to</sentence><sentence id="307">usually, | try, you know, whenever there are things that used to bubble up to the surface, | would always, either call a friend, or do something constructive or read a good book and get myself away from it.</sentence><sentence id="308">But going through the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> put me into a depression where | had difficulty pulling myself out of.</sentence><sentence id="309">So what really scares me about dwelling too much on the past is that it does create a bitterness.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="310">[end of side one of tape one]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: So, where were we?</sentence><sentence id="312">Okay, you were saying why you didn't want to dwell on it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Yeah, | think it's depressing to dwell on it, it's very depressing to me, okay?</sentence><sentence id="314">So | would rather not dwell on it, | would rather look at the life I'm leading now and to my future, really.</sentence><sentence id="315">So | guess I'm finished with that thought.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: How did you pull yourself out of it at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: | think | got the help from friends.</sentence><sentence id="322">| have, | have the most incredible circle of friends and they were calling all the time and they were checking up on me and they were suggesting things we should be doing and they were bringing me books and | started reading again and | started getting involved in life.</sentence><sentence id="323">You know, life is irresistible, it's, if you start getting involved in it, it just carries you along and that's what you need to do and that's really what | did to pull myself out of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: All right, let's go back for a moment, you were talking about the business.</sentence><sentence id="328">We had gotten to the point where | believe you were going to sell it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Yes, sell it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: Okay, so let's start up at that point and then the following years after that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Right, okay.</sentence><sentence id="336">So we decided to sell the business mainly because my husband, my husband's health at that point was a little shaky and he, it was, he was really suffering from extreme exhaustion, so we decided to sell the business, but it's not so easy to sell a business like that and it took about a year to complete the sale.</sentence><sentence id="337">And then we were staying on for awhile because it was part of our contract, so we stayed on for awhile, but then we, Jim just wanted no part of it any more, he wanted to get out of it, so we renegotiated out, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> to renegotiate his contract and we left the business in very good shape, you know, with very good people are there running it and it's still in excellent, it's a very good business that they bought themselves.</sentence><sentence id="338">And then we had about a year to decide, you know, to clean up all the paperwork from the sale and the distribution of, to all the employees and all of that and then we decided to do a little bit of traveling and | think just about that time, our son went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, so the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nest</span> was really empty and he teases us, funny because for my 60th birthday, he gave us a whole speech, you know, they gave me a party and he made a speech and he said when he went off to</sentence><sentence id="340"><span class="BUILDING">college</span>, he had the impression that this is the moment we were waiting for, really, because our bags must have been packed, because the minute he went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, off we went.</sentence><sentence id="341">And we did a lot of traveling, we did.</sentence><sentence id="342">I'm trying to remember, | know we made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, but that was still for business, this was, we did one last piece of business for the, for the company which we sold and we had some contracts with Japanese publishers and we had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, so we did that, which was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="343">And we went to Europe, we traveled with friends, with our friends from <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>, you know, whom Jim has known since <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with them, we took a trip to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with them.</sentence><sentence id="345">We had other friends we were traveling with.</sentence><sentence id="346">We went to, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Alaska</span>, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">We really did quite a bit of traveling and | love to travel.</sentence><sentence id="348">And we enjoy it.</sentence><sentence id="349">We usually go with friends, one or two couples.</sentence><sentence id="350">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> just recently, we went to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> last May.</sentence><sentence id="351">So we have done quite a bit of traveling, but the first year we really did a lot of traveling, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you know, going to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span>, doing just more, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, more local things.</sentence><sentence id="352">And then we decided to open a different kind of <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> because Jim's ambition was always to be a publisher of books, not of specialized material like we had just sold, but of trade books.</sentence><sentence id="353">So we started Adler and Adler publishers.</sentence><sentence id="354">And we ran that <span class="BUILDING">company</span> for a couple of years and we published some 46 or 48 books.</sentence><sentence id="355">And that was entirely different ball game.</sentence><sentence id="356">It was very interesting because | started doing editing, which | had never done before and | really liked it.</sentence><sentence id="357">But after awhile, you know, we noticed that the book business, the climate had changed, it was very difficult to sell books and particularly the kind of books we liked, you know, literary books, serious books, they weren't selling easily, it was very difficult to market them.</sentence><sentence id="358">So we decided to phase it out.</sentence><sentence id="359">But by then | had become involved in community work.</sentence><sentence id="360">| became associated with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Arena Stage</span>, | don't know if you are familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Arena Stage Theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">| got on the board of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Arena Stage</span> and | was very active there.</sentence><sentence id="362">We, both Jim and | joined Jewish organizations, like American Jewish Committee and we became very active, in fact Jim is now President, just became President of the Washington chapter of AJC.</sentence><sentence id="363">And | got on the board of the Capital Children's Museum, | became very friendly with the director there, Ann Lewin(ph) and for awhile | was quite active there, although I'm not active now, even though they still keep my name on the board, | hardly go to meetings any more and | really sort of became very much involved in community affairs of that sort, you know, particularly in the arts.</sentence><sentence id="364">I'm also on the board of the opera, so you know, | go to the opera a lot, | go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> a lot and as a consequence of being on those boards, particularly the Arena Stage, we made a lot of friends who are similarly inclined, who love the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, you know, so there's a whole group of us who love the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and who play tennis and we play tennis and travel and we travel.</sentence><sentence id="365">We just went with two of the couple to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">So we, we really have become more involved in the community.</sentence><sentence id="367">We still have an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and some of the</sentence><sentence id="369">books are still being sold, but | don't need to go in there because my <span class="REGION">area</span> was more acquiring books, dealing with agents and editing and we are not acquiring new books, so it's just a matter of running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and make sure that some of the books that are still selling are being reprinted and sold.</sentence><sentence id="370">So my husband goes into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, but | do not.</sentence><sentence id="371">And we're very much involved in the community, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and such.</sentence><sentence id="372">So that's really what our lives are like right now. (</sentence><sentence id="373">pause).</sentence><sentence id="374">All right, we have two children, yeah | think we should, | want to talk a little bit about the children now, we have two children, we have a daughter Laura, who is 35 years old and we have a son Eric, who is 31 years old.</sentence><sentence id="375">Our daughter lives in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and she is married and she has two children.</sentence><sentence id="376">| have a six year old granddaughter and a almost two year old grandson and they live in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and | see them often, so, you know, | also, this is something | really enjoy, seeing my grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="377">| think probably my past has affected my children, but it is very hard for me to evaluate in what way.</sentence><sentence id="378">When | look at our son, who was married, is divorced now, who came out of, from <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swathmore(ph</span>) and started teaching because he got married like three weeks after he got out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and he needed a job so he started teaching and who has just changed his life.</sentence><sentence id="379">He decided a year ago to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so he is now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> and he is going in for a business degree.</sentence><sentence id="380">In fact, this weekend, we were in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> visiting with him because he had asked us to come and sit in on a day of his classes, which is extremely interesting, it's some <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Wharton, it really is.</sentence><sentence id="381">Very high-powered and the people, the young people, they are very bright, very quick.</sentence><sentence id="382">It's really, it's satisfying to see so many intelligent and quick-witted people who are going to be, you know, running our business world.</sentence><sentence id="383">| think it's sort of satisfying.</sentence><sentence id="384">He seems, | don't think anybody could tell that he is a survivor, that he is the child of a survivor of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="385">| don't think he was affected by it.</sentence><sentence id="386">He has his problems like everybody else has their problems and he has his areas of tensions, I'm sure, but | would say that, touching wood, Eric functions as an extremely well-adjusted and happy individual.</sentence><sentence id="387">Our daughter | think, bore more of the brunt of it.</sentence><sentence id="388">Maybe it's because she's more sensitive and she digs around in the past more.</sentence><sentence id="389">She's very interested in what do you call it, in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">family trees</span> and things like that and | could not provide her _____ knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="390">| could not provide her with a family background, of course.</sentence><sentence id="391">| think it bothered her always, okay?</sentence><sentence id="392">But she married somebody from the midwest, who has a very long lineage, which can be documented and goes all the way back to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span>, he's a Scotch man and so she's perfectly happy and she digs around in his <span class="ENV_FEATURES">family trees</span> and that keeps her happy.</sentence><sentence id="393">With her | think that she, she bore more the brunt of it because, first of all because she was older and secondly because she takes things harder than our son does and | think she's convinced that my having been a Holocaust survivor, in spite of the fact that she didn't know about it for the first 10 years of her life, had a big effect on her because | was too protective, | worried too much about, you know, that she shouldn't catch cold, that</sentence><sentence id="395">she should eat the right things and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="396">But then | point out there is plenty of American mothers who do the same thing, so | don't know whether she's right or not and | think it's futile to even spend too much energy discussing it.</sentence><sentence id="397">If that's what she wants to believe, that's okay, but Laura hey, there's nothing | can do about it.</sentence><sentence id="398">My past is my past, you know.</sentence><sentence id="399">You're just going to have to accept it the way I'm accepting it.</sentence><sentence id="400">| think she has more difficulty accepting my past than | do.</sentence><sentence id="401">However, maybe with age, that will fade also, okay?</sentence><sentence id="402">| think one of the things that bothers her the most is that she is fearful and she is scared, but if she had to be in my shoes, she would not have survived.</sentence><sentence id="403">And no amount of my telling her, "Laura, nobody knows what they can do when they have to do it and nobody can, with certainty predict that if | do this, this or this, | will survive.</sentence><sentence id="404">It's a lottery and you have to take it the way it comes."</sentence><sentence id="405">| don't think she quite buys it and she feels ill equipped to have survived the same things that | survived, which, you know, no matter what | tell her about it, that | don't know how | did it either and if you had to do it, you probably could do it too and nobody knows in advance.</sentence><sentence id="406">It doesn't matter how much | reinforce that, she has her ideas that she is not quite up to snuff to survive in something like that and finally my answer is, well | hope you never have to and that's it, you know, because there's nothing else | can do about it.</sentence><sentence id="407">So | think she has been affected by it in that, in that way.</sentence><sentence id="408">| don't know what it's called, _ | think maybe she should join a group of children of Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="409">In fact, | have mentioned it once, but | don't know whether she will or not.</sentence><sentence id="410">Right now she's much too busy, she has two children, she just finished her Master's degree in counseling and she's going to do art therapy.</sentence><sentence id="411">Right now she has, she works two and a half days a week with disturbed teenagers, where she does art therapy and she has two small children.</sentence><sentence id="412">| don't think she can take, take on anything more.</sentence><sentence id="413">And she's, also she joined, even though she is married to a Quaker, a non-Jew, she joined the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">local temple</span> where they are members and she's very active in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, so | think she has plenty to do right now and I'm not even suggesting any more that she should do anything else.</sentence><sentence id="414">As a result, we have joined their <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> too, which is in <span class="REGION">northern Virginia</span>, because we felt that, since our son was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> right now anyhow, we might just as well spend the holidays and go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where our daughter is.</sentence><sentence id="415">In fact, she's much more observant than | ever was.</sentence><sentence id="416">Every Friday she lights candles with the children and she says the prayer over wine and bread.</sentence><sentence id="417">At least once a month they take the kids to what they call Tutshabat(ph), you know, services for the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="418">She goes to all the functions at the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and she has joined a group, | forgot what it's called, they are young people who are studying Judaism and how, what Jews now can do and expect of Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="419">And she committed herself, she went to several seminars.</sentence><sentence id="420">You have to commit yourself, | think it's an arm of UJA who is doing that and it's, she feels very Jewish and she feels very proud to be a Jew, because there's so much intellectual accomplishments amongst the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="421">Our son is non-practicing,</sentence><sentence id="423">however he surprised me greatly, he got married, when he got married, he married also a non-Jew, but the, a rabbi married them and she accepted to raise the children Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="424">In fact she committed herself voluntarily.</sentence><sentence id="425">But that's immaterial at this point because she's divorce, even though we still continue to see my former little daughter-in-law because | mean, she was part of the family, you know.</sentence><sentence id="426">So we still are in touch with her.</sentence><sentence id="427">He's not, but we are.</sentence><sentence id="428">He is now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> and he is very much career bound now, to make his way, what he's doing, but he surprised us, he called on Yom Kippur to say he was fasting.</sentence><sentence id="429">So, you know, | guess he's not a practicing Jew, but he's a Jew and | think he knows he's a Jew and | think he will continue the tradition.</sentence><sentence id="430">So that pleases me.</sentence><sentence id="431">Anything else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: What kind of role did Judaism play with them growing up and with you and your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: They went to, well when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they went to, my daughter went to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, my son was too young.</sentence><sentence id="532">She went to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, she's a very quick study and she's very bright, so she was learning Hebrew and she was learning all the songs.</sentence><sentence id="533">And she still knows them.</sentence><sentence id="534">Then, when we moved here, we joined a congregation, which was <span class="BUILDING">Bethesda Jewish Congregation</span>, which was a very strange congregation and not too successful for us, because the kids hated <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> so much, it was so poorly organized and so poorly done, that they absolutely refused to be bar mitzvahed.</sentence><sentence id="535">And we decided not to force the issue.</sentence><sentence id="536">Now my daughter is, has voluntarily come back to it and I'm hoping that my son will do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="537">When he was getting married and he married a non-Jew, | said, "Just don't forget where | come from, that's all I'm asking of you."</sentence><sentence id="538">And he said, "Mom, | promise | won't."</sentence><sentence id="539">And | think that's good enough for me, so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: What about you personally and how your ideas changed about <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span>, after?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: Yes, yeah, well | must say, | was a very reluctant Jew, if you go back in my history, the way the Jews grabbed me away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, | was a very reluctant Jew, but | have slowly come back to it.</sentence><sentence id="552">I've never denied it, but | never practiced it.| think I'm somewhat more Jewish oriented now, | realize that we are a small minority who has accomplished enormous things in spite of all the difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="553">| think the climate is changing also and that Jews are going to be more, treated with more respect, at least | hope.</sentence><sentence id="554">We are very much identified with Jewish causes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we do belong to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, where we feel that, we don't, we go there because Laura wants to be more practicing and we go for the holidays and we take the children there, you know, for Sukote(ph) and and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="555">So | think, plus the fact, oh there was something else happened.</sentence><sentence id="556">| went, a friend asked me to go to <span class="BUILDING">bible class</span> with them, given by a woman in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, Naomi Rosenblatt, about whom you might have read about because she just came out with a book, Wrestling with Angels?</sentence><sentence id="557">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="558">Well | took some <span class="BUILDING">bible classes</span> and |</sentence><sentence id="560">think that sort of also helped me along a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="561">It sort of portrays the Jews as a mixed lot, you know, it doesn't try to gloss over the imperfections and | decided that they are people, like everybody else and you have to sort of identify yourself with them.</sentence><sentence id="562">So it has helped me to sort of get back into the fold also, the bible classes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="576">Q: Okay, | just want to go back for a moment and talk a little bit more about some of the difficulties in making the transition to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: Well the first difficulty | had to grapple with was language, when | came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you know, how to learn the language quickly, because even when you speak a language, for instance, you don't think of stupid little things like, we would go out in a group together and they would say, tell jokes and | wouldn't understand the joke, okay?</sentence><sentence id="579">So you sort of feel out of it, you feel like the outsider and | must say that, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, which has greeted me with such warmth and accepted me, you know, people accepted me everywhere, | very often do feel like the outsider.</sentence><sentence id="580">Like they reminisce, with a great deal of nostalgia about the good old days of certain songs, or the big bands and I'm looking like, you must be kidding, what are you talking about, you know, | can't even figure out what they are talking about.</sentence><sentence id="581">Oh, | remember when we were in, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and a group of us, eight of us, went to see Judy Garland, was singing at one of the, the big, the big <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and we went to see her and | thought she was awful, she was drunk, she couldn't sing and everybody was clapping and standing up and giving her.</sentence><sentence id="582">It's the nostalgia of the past which | am not sharing with anybody, even with people who are very close to me, like my husband, | am not sharing the nostalgia of the past.</sentence><sentence id="583">| know | am an outsider whenever they talk about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days or songs or music or the <span class="BUILDING">musical theater</span>, I'm the outsider.</sentence><sentence id="584">But that's one thing | have to accept, | mean it's not so bad, actually, to have to accept that.</sentence><sentence id="585">So that's one <span class="REGION">area</span> where | felt out of it, plus the fact | had to learn the language very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="586">There are other ways, you know, which, there are times when | feel, when | read about what's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> for instance, | feel such, | have such a desperate feeling that, why are people doing that to other people?</sentence><sentence id="587">You know, | still am trying to understand the cruelty that men are capable of.</sentence><sentence id="588">It's, | think it's affecting me more than it's affecting other people.</sentence><sentence id="589">| have reached the point where | can't, | simply cannot, couldn't read about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>, or about what was going on in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and places like that.</sentence><sentence id="590">I've, it, | took it too personally, you know.</sentence><sentence id="591">Probably much more personally than Americans by and large would take it because | lived through something like that.</sentence><sentence id="592">It's still incomprehensible to me and | cannot understand that it's still going on, that people are still doing things like that.</sentence><sentence id="593">So that's an <span class="REGION">area</span> where it's giving me a great deal of difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="594">| sort of, | protect myself.</sentence><sentence id="595">| don't read about it, | don't want to know the details, I'm staying away from it.</sentence><sentence id="596">It's cowardly, but it, that's the only way | can work it.</sentence><sentence id="597">There are ways also that, you know, there are times when | have a lot of self doubts, you know, | haven't, I'm</sentence><sentence id="599">not always, I'm pretty well assured and | am very self reliant, but there are times when | feel I'm in situations where | feel | haven't been equipped right for them.</sentence><sentence id="600">For the longest time, although that's less and less, | had the most tremendous gaps in my learning and knowledge, you know, like history, | didn't learn about it, | didn't start until | was 11 years old to learn how to read and write, so consequently | have enormous gaps of knowledge in <span class="NPIP">places</span> which most people feel very confident and very comfortable in and I'm not, you know.</sentence><sentence id="601">So then | have to pedal back and say, "Oh, | have got to inform myself on this.".</sentence><sentence id="602">So | am always playing catch up.</sentence><sentence id="603">No matter what I'm doing, I'm playing catch up, okay?</sentence><sentence id="604">But at this point I'm quite comfortable because | have noticed that other friends of mine, who have had a pretty normal life, playing catch up in many ways too.</sentence><sentence id="605">So, but it took awhile for me to feel that I'm not the only one who has to play catch up.</sentence><sentence id="606">There is no such a person, who has an enormous amount of knowledge in every <span class="REGION">area</span> and they can feel confident in every <span class="REGION">area</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="607">Most people have gaps in <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">So that's another one.</sentence><sentence id="609">When I'm feeling disturbed, when I'm feeling upset or things like that, | can very well go through very disturbed nights where I'm dreaming and most of the time I'm dreaming that my life is in danger, which | don't think most people who have had a normal life, do dream about that.</sentence><sentence id="610">My life is in danger and I'm running for my life, you know.</sentence><sentence id="611">It's a very uncomfortable feeling to have, but | have to deal with that.</sentence><sentence id="612">It's not uncommon for me to wake up in a sweat because somebody has been chasing me and has been shooting at me.</sentence><sentence id="613">| have to get over it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="650">Q: Have you had, because | remember dreams played such an important role in your survival in a way, have you had even dreams about people from the past at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: All along my life, yeah, | do dream about people from the past, people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> | have known, occasionally a person will surface who | think is either my father of my mother, but it's not very coherent and it's not very clear, but | do, yes, | definitely do dream about people in the past.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="654">Q: Another thing that strikes me is, and you sort of touched on it earlier about how difficult it was for you to, your husband had to convince you to actually buy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: How do you look at even, <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and how was that transition, it seems that it would have been a difficult one.</sentence><sentence id="659">Maybe you can talk about that a little bit more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: Yeah, I'm not very much attached to material objects, you know, it's, it's sort of, it's almost like they are on loan to me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="663">So | have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="664">It took me a long time to get, acquire a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, but it's only an object and it's on loan to</sentence><sentence id="666">me, somehow.</sentence><sentence id="667">My <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> have always been like that, you know, they are on loan to me, they are not part of me.</sentence><sentence id="668">| know that many of my friends, their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> are so, or their possessions are so important to them, you know, it's a great comfort to them.</sentence><sentence id="669">To me it's not really that much of a comfort, possessions.</sentence><sentence id="670">Yes, diamonds, because | can pack them in and run.</sentence><sentence id="671">So you know, a diamond is to me a prized possession because it's something | can take with me and it will feed me for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="672">Not because it's a diamond, but because it's going to feed me for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="673">Other <span class="NPIP">things</span> don't really count.</sentence><sentence id="674">My son always teased me, he cooks, he likes to cook, my son and he is the one who always had to go out with my husband and buy all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen gadgets</span>, because | never had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen gadgets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">| cooked, but | always make do with what | had, | never needed a million gadgets like most cooks | know need, you know.</sentence><sentence id="676">They provided me with the gadgets.</sentence><sentence id="677">Otherwise they knew | wasn't going to go out and buy the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gadgets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">So, it's sort of that and also when we had children, you know it's funny to mention it because | don't know whether people think of that.</sentence><sentence id="679">| had a hard time having more than two children, because | only have two hands and if | needed to run, | was going to grab a child with each hand and run.</sentence><sentence id="680">So for me, more than two children was out of the question.</sentence><sentence id="681">How could | have run with three children?</sentence><sentence id="682">That wasn't going to be feasible.</sentence><sentence id="683">So that's why we have two children.</sentence><sentence id="684">| happen to like children a lot, it's just that, that thing, that fixed idea that if | had to run, | only have two hands and two children | can manage, but more than that | can't.</sentence><sentence id="685">So that's another, you know, there are little things like that which you don't think of.</sentence><sentence id="686">| used to drive my kids crazy if they had a rash, | was always there with the powder, you know, the Ammen's powder.</sentence><sentence id="687">| just drove them crazy with that, because to me having a rash was dangerous, because if you had a rash, you got yourself shot, because it meant you had, you had contact, contracted some disease and they weren't going to fool around, to have the whole <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> infected, so they were going to shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="688">So to me a rash is an ugly thing, life threatening, absolutely life threatening, so that's another.</sentence><sentence id="689">You know, you have those things that are very, come out in small ways, you know, very unexpected ways really, that they come out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Do you have to sort of catch yourself doing this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: Yes, oh absolutely, yeah and in the end | made a joke of it, you know, that's the only thing you can do about it, make a joke of it really, so.</sentence><sentence id="721">Also | think it has affected my friendships.</sentence><sentence id="722">I'm only, | will not be friendly with somebody on whom | cannot have confidence and count on.</sentence><sentence id="723">| have to be able to rely on somebody.</sentence><sentence id="724">If | have somebody who | notice is not reliable, they do not, they are not amongst my best friends.</sentence><sentence id="725">You know, they are acquaintances, but | will never make a good friend of somebody who is not a very reliable person.</sentence><sentence id="726">Most of my friends are extremely reliable, so.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="730">Q: Tell me some other ways you think the Holocaust sort of played into your life.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: I'm very self-reliant.</sentence><sentence id="732">| think for the longest time it drove Jim crazy that | would never take anybody's word for something, you know | would listen and then | would usually try to make up my own mind and it's very difficult for me to follow somebody else's advice unless | have really given it some thought and decided that it was very good advice, that it made sense and that | have internalized it.</sentence><sentence id="733">I'm not a follower, | can't follow, because following would have meant death to me, | had to make up my own mind whether | was going to go on the right or the left, because the right might be death and the left might be life.</sentence><sentence id="734">So it can be difficult for a spouse, you know, that you have to make up your own mind about everything.</sentence><sentence id="735">| think | have somewhat softened it, you know, because if person, if people have proven themselves to have very good judgment and to give me very good advice, I'm more likely to take that advice now.</sentence><sentence id="736">But when | was younger, nope, | wouldn't take anybody's advice, | wouldn't take anybody's word for anything.</sentence><sentence id="737">| had to really make sure for myself that where | stepped was safe.</sentence><sentence id="738">And it can be unnerving for a person who has lead a normal life to come across somebody like that, it was very unnerving for my husband.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="747">Q: How did it affect your marriage, because you said that you didn't tell Jim initially about it, so if you were to act like that, | was wondering how he would figure out that that was where it was coming from?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Well, he knew.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="752">Tape 2</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="753">Q: Okay, let's start again with how the, your experience affected your marriage, your relationship with Jim.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="754">A: | don't know whether my experience, well it probably did in one way and that is, having been a survivor, | realized that surviving meant helping each other, okay?You didn't survive unless you got help and consequently | probably was of much more help to him than an American wife would have been.</sentence><sentence id="755">Jim had his problems getting adjusted to work and working for other people, he never could work well for other people and | was always a partner to him in that respect because first of all, | understood very quickly what was bothering him and | was able to, he was able to talk things over with me.</sentence><sentence id="756">He never made a move in his career without talking it over with me and without getting my help.</sentence><sentence id="757">| think that Holocaust survivors, at least my impression is, have an enormous amount of empathy for others and for their problems.</sentence><sentence id="758">Maybe I'm generalizing too much, maybe I'm just speaking, | have an enormous amount of empathy for other people and their problems and certainly for a spouse's problems.</sentence><sentence id="759">So, consequently | think | was more helpful to him than | think an American spouse would have been.</sentence><sentence id="760">So in that respect, he got the benefit of my having been a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="761">The same time, he probably got some of the drawbacks, like | was much more cautious.</sentence><sentence id="762">But | wasn't cautious to the point where | could, | would call him back, because as a matter of fact when he went into business for himself, | remember sitting with friends and a friend saying, "How could you let him do that?</sentence><sentence id="763">| would never let Les go into business for himself, it's too threatening."</sentence><sentence id="764">| could do it, because | knew how important it was to him, you see and | knew that it was important for him to do work that was satisfying and where he was happy.</sentence><sentence id="765">So | could, you know | could help him.</sentence><sentence id="766">In fact | help him very much when he went into <span class="BUILDING">business</span> for himself.</sentence><sentence id="767">In other ways, | probably had more patience than most normal people, quote, normal people would have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: What about the self-reliant part you were talking about before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="786">Well that annoyed him very often, that | wasn't more dependent on him, you know.</sentence><sentence id="787">Our generation, women were much more dependent on men and men liked that.</sentence><sentence id="788">| think Jim missed it to a certain extent, that | was so completely self- reliant and didn't depend on him.</sentence><sentence id="789">| had to learn to soften it a little bit, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: When you say self-reliant and not dependent on him, do you mean emotionally, or?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: In many ways, different ways.</sentence><sentence id="798">Emotionally, opening <span class="DLF">doors</span> for myself or doing things for myself, you know and emotionally too, you know, not being, not being that reliant on him.</sentence><sentence id="799">Feeling | have to make my own way, | have to, you know, |</sentence><sentence id="801">have to stand on my own two feet, | can't, in a way, probably without him knowing it, that was good for him, because it allowed, it liberated him to do his own thing.</sentence><sentence id="802">But | think there were times where he was annoyed because | was so independent.</sentence><sentence id="803">And | softened it and he got used to it.</sentence><sentence id="804">So | think what it sounds like is like a normal marriage, doesn't it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="813">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="815">A: | don't think there was anything abnormal about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="817">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="818">How long have you been married?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="821">A: 40 years.</sentence><sentence id="822">It will be 40 years this June.</sentence><sentence id="823">That's a long time, yeah, that's a very long time.</sentence><sentence id="824">| don't know.</sentence><sentence id="825">Well, another positive fallout from my past is that I'm very observant, because | had to learn, my life depended on it and that stood us in very good stead when we went into business together and in other ways.</sentence><sentence id="826">| could read people's reactions very quickly and many a time we would go into negotiations and | would be sitting there and men were wondering, "What is he doing with his little wife there?"</sentence><sentence id="827">You know and | would listen very carefully and then | would play back to him what happened and tell him that we had to do this or that because this is what | observed.</sentence><sentence id="828">| don't think he would have observed that and as a matter of fact, he said so, he never would have observed it.</sentence><sentence id="829">It was sort of uncomfortable, here | was, a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of men and me, you know and sometime everybody was looking, | am supposed to get up and get coffee only I'm not getting up to get coffee you know, I'm sitting there listening.</sentence><sentence id="830">But after awhile it became normal for us to operate as a team like that and even the Japanese got used to it, they didn't know what to make of us when we got there, you know, who goes first, me or him?When we have to march into the <span class="BUILDING">president's office</span>, who goes first, Jim or me?They were completely confused.</sentence><sentence id="831">| think it brought more advantages than disadvantages.</sentence><sentence id="832">I'm sure there were disadvantages, I'm sure that | was much less spontaneous than normally brought up people would be, but on the other hand, | brought all the advantages.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: What would you observe when you were sitting there?</sentence><sentence id="848">Give us some examples.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="851">A: | would observe people and what, how they reacted, their facial expressions and how they reacted and | read people pretty well.</sentence><sentence id="852">My survival depended on it, to read people well.</sentence><sentence id="853">So | can, | can make a pretty shrewd guess, usually, about what they wanted out of a deal or what they weren't going to give up and, you know and be helpful in that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: Was your observations usually correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="862">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="863">Yeah, he learned how to rely on them completely because they were usually pretty correct.</sentence><sentence id="864">My readings were pretty correct, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="868">Q: It sounded like you have this, it's almost | guess a gift, in a way, of seeing things, or sort of perception that's very sharp.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="870">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: How else did that work into your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: Maybe being more understanding, you know, understanding more when somebody was having difficulties delivering on times, you know and doing things like our employees, | was, rather than firing them, | was more apt to moving them around from <span class="NPIP">job</span> to <span class="NPIP">job</span> to see if we could find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> for them, you know what | mean?</sentence><sentence id="875">| did a lot of that and that was usually on my advice, you know, let's not fire them, they're not working well, but let's try to see if we can fit them in somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="876">So that's another way it would work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="880">Q: What about your children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="882">A: Well they claim that | was a very strict mother.</sentence><sentence id="883">And at the beginning Laura would say, "That's because you're French," and | said, "You're right, that's fine."</sentence><sentence id="884">You know, it didn't matter, | would be very strict, she had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by a certain time, she didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="885">We had to eat our meals as a family, you know, they wanted to, to eat on the run and run out and we'd, why did we have to eat dinner together, you have to eat dinner together, because that's when we are sitting down and talking together.</sentence><sentence id="886">So, and the other thing is that we never went off on too many vacations with our children, without our children, you know, friends of ours would go off and leave the kids, you know, either with a grandparent, we didn't have a grandparent to leave them with, or with a maid and | never did that, | never had a full time maid, you know, | only had help, but | didn't have a full time maid taking care of children, | was always there and consequently our children always came on vacation with us.</sentence><sentence id="887">We had to travel without them on business and that | had to and | had no choice, but if it was for pleasure or vacation, they always came with us.</sentence><sentence id="888">As a matter of fact Eric and Laura came to Europe when he was seven years old and she was 11, because | went to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="889">And we made many trips together, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">By the time they were teenagers, they had already traveled and they were always traveling with us.</sentence><sentence id="891">As a consequence, our kids spent a lot of time with us.</sentence><sentence id="892">| think that's probably why.</sentence><sentence id="893">| know that my friend complain they don't want to go with them anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="894">Our kids are the ones who suggested, we have made it now a family tradition that for Memorial Day we all go away together, with all the children.</sentence><sentence id="895">We used to all go away at Christmas time, between Christmas and New Year when Eric was still in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and Laura was already married, until Laura had</sentence><sentence id="897">a child.</sentence><sentence id="898">We always went away for a week to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span>, together.</sentence><sentence id="899">We spent a lot of time with the family.</sentence><sentence id="900">Birthdays are always a big celebration, you know, it's like a three, it's like a Polish wedding.</sentence><sentence id="901">From the time they were very little, they had a party where they invited all their friends and they played games, they had one day when they wanted to go to the favorite <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for dinner, just the family and one day where | had to make their favorite dish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="902">So it's was always three celebrations for each birthday.</sentence><sentence id="903">Our daughter complained that when she went off to and!</sentence><sentence id="904">was ____ too, when she went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, nobody made a big deal about the birthday and she felt very let down, you know.</sentence><sentence id="905">So |, so they were, | was sitting there, getting reproaches that we made too much of a big deal about birthdays and so when they went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, suddenly the rest of the world didn't sit up and take notice of it.</sentence><sentence id="906">| said, "Well, you will forgive me, | hope, you know, that | made a big deal about it."</sentence><sentence id="907">Jim didn't have a very happy childhood, he can't ever remember a birthday party, his parents haven't given him, so consequently his birthday is always celebrated with a great deal of fanfare.</sentence><sentence id="908">So we have those big celebrations, the family.</sentence><sentence id="909">We are a small family, but we always have lots of celebrations.</sentence><sentence id="910">So that's a way of, of .</sentence><sentence id="911">Another way that | can notice now with my grandchildren is, and that's not too good, it's almost like | see in my little granddaughter, me as a child and | am so protective of her that | am driving her mother crazy at times.</sentence><sentence id="912">So | had to take a step back and say, "Cool it.""</sentence><sentence id="913">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="914">| am very protective of her.</sentence><sentence id="915">| will notice much faster than her mother when she is not well.</sentence><sentence id="916">You know, when she has a cold brewing or something and | will say, "Laura, | think she's coming down with something."</sentence><sentence id="917">You know, because | am so, I'm like a hawk over her.</sentence><sentence id="918">It's not good.</sentence><sentence id="919">So | am sort of trying to step back and not, my daughter's much more laid back.</sentence><sentence id="920">She had a cold, she has a cold, she will go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyhow, you know.</sentence><sentence id="921">| would never do that, but | have to step back and say well, that's her way of running things, okay?</sentence><sentence id="922">So.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: One thing | wanted to ask you about is you were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, where do you consider yourself, you say the kids said, "Well, you're from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, " so talk about that, how that affected you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: Well, | told everybody | was from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because it would have been too complicated an explanation and telling my life story to everybody who asked me where | was from.</sentence><sentence id="968">It was easiest to say | came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because | spent quite a few years there and | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, so consequently, and | liked <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, | really liked it, so it was very easy for me to say, | grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, but | was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that's usually what | tell people and it's pretty accurate.</sentence><sentence id="969">You know, because | don't have, | cannot tell them all the detours | made, it's just too many and it would tell that, you know, when you start with one ... so how come you were there and how come you were there.</sentence><sentence id="970">It would be very difficult for me to explain that</sentence><sentence id="972">without telling my story to everybody and | don't like to do it.</sentence><sentence id="973">| wanted to make a point, what was the point about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="982">Q: Considering that you're not from anywhere, you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
