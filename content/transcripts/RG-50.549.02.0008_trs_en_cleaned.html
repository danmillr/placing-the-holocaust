<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="630">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 20 the Slotkin's somehow came on the scene and they, at this point had Irene, who was my twin sister and I guess it seemed

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="800">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="801">Well, my first -- when I first left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, it was -- I was alone on a <span

id="804"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0008 25 name, but Mr. Enright played a real big role in my life for the next -- oh, at least half a year.</sentence><sentence id="805">He -- we -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="806">I remember we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> and now we were sort of closer to the Slotkins, away from the Mauns and Ill never forget the first time they made a telephone connection with the Slotkins, I -- I hid under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">I didn't want to somehow respond or talk, even though I knew about them, I knew who they were.</sentence><sentence id="808">I mean, didn't know about them, but I knew they were the Slotkins, who -- where my sister was.</sentence><sentence id="809">But I was just totally shaken up by this.</sentence><sentence id="810">I'm not even sure whether I talked to them that one time.</sentence><sentence id="811">But we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> together and -- I mean in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together and there he would carry on during the day, doing his thing, whatever he had to do to get clearances for me and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="812">And he engaged a teacher for me at the time, to teach me -- start teaching me Slovak.</sentence><sentence id="813">And part of the education was to go ahead and see as many foreign movies -- American movies, also English movies, so I would get used to -- I'm sorry, I have to take all that back, not to teach me Slovak, to teach me English.</sentence><sentence id="814">And part of this whole thing was to take me to see English movies.</sentence><sentence id="815">And one of the first movies that I remember was "Lassie Come Back."</sentence><sentence id="816">Elizabeth Taylor, she was a girl at the time, a very beautiful girl, blue eyes, black hair, white skin.</sentence><sentence id="817">And there was this beautiful black horse.</sentence><sentence id="818">No, no, that's "Black Beauty", that's another one that I saw.</sentence><sentence id="819">But "Lassie" was the first one.</sentence><sentence id="820">Also, there were cowboy movies I| saw -- if I can try to remember some of those old names.</sentence><sentence id="821">That was way before Hopalong Cassidy came on the scene, it was -- oh, maybe I'1] remember later.</sentence><sentence id="822">But that was part of it, Laurel and

RG-50.549.02*0008 26 the feel of the language and -- and with the help of this tutor, I sort of somehow got myself started in English.</sentence><sentence id="827">I don't know how -- what I really achieved other than I was exposed to it.</sentence><sentence id="828">It seemed that though, that Mr. Enright didn't have much luck in getting whatever papers were necessary to get me over here right away, so -- there was -- and he couldn't spend any more time or something like that, so I had to be brought somewhere, put away somewhere -- who to leave we -- me with.</sentence><sentence id="829">So it was decided to send me to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, to a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="830"><span class="BUILDING">Institute Usher</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balaban</span>, which was Jewish oriented I'm sure, because the headmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had a beard and a yarmulke and I do remember Friday night services, now that I think about it and we always stood up to La hoda di lacross kallor, which is one of the prayers that we say in our Friday nights also, but we sit down,

id="840">I do remember going skiing.</sentence><sentence id="841">We would get on to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, which would take us, even though it was a rainy, cloudy day, would take -- they would -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> would take us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, above the clouds, into bright blue skies and sunshine and we would ski.</sentence><sentence id="842">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> also has other -- lots of good memories.</sentence><sentence id="843">At this point, I had the funds, now I had the backer -- a rich backer in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, my sister and her -- her future adoptive parents.</sentence><sentence id="844">So I had some money, I had some credit, come to think of it, it</sentence><sentence id="846">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0008 27 wasn't even money, I had credit at the <span class="BUILDING">school office</span> where I could buy candy.</sentence><sentence id="847">I remember it was a very specific kind of a marshmallow chocolate covered candy, very delicious.</sentence><sentence id="848">One other thing about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which I remember very, very clearly.</sentence><sentence id="849">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> -- in <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and every morning we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> in another <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, while it was still dark and cold sometimes -- very, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="850">So we ran through whatever <span class="DLF">yard</span> there was in our nightclothes and into these <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, which were somehow automatically regulated.</sentence><sentence id="851">You get into them -- they lasted only so long, the water started from lukewarm to warm and then it slowly start to cool.</sentence><sentence id="852">So you had to do your thing.</sentence><sentence id="853">You had to get soaped up and you had to get clean and still try and enjoy some of the warmth that was left after you've done what you had to do.</sentence><sentence id="854">But, that it ran cold and if you were brave enough, you stayed in.</sentence><sentence id="855">And it turned out to be a lot of kids did stay in, most of us did.</sentence><sentence id="856">And it sort of -- it was a very healthy thing to do, because I don't ever remember being sick.</sentence><sentence id="857">None of them ever got sick and we ran wet -- half wet into our -- into our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> from -- from the <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">I do -- that was something I remember again about my stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="859">There I learned also -- there they put me on a program to learn Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="860">So I started writing, copying things in Hebrew, even though I had no idea what I was -- what I was saying, but writing, copying things in Hebrew and trying to pronounce some of the things, Hebrew started then for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
