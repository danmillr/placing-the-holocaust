<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="964">Q: What did the teachers ask you, and what did you answer them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="966">A: Why -- well, they knew why I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, how it was over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I told them about Kristallnacht and having to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, having to leave my grandparents and they were very interested in that part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="967">Later on [indecipherable] when I was in eighth grade I helped my parents -- I knew the language by then so well that I helped my parents study for the citizenship, and -- I went over the questions with them, which was hard for my father.</sentence><sentence id="968">My mother could do it.</sentence><sentence id="969">Questions, you know, about American history.</sentence><sentence id="970">But then, of course, I was learning -- at that point I was learning about American history, and one of the teachers even asked me to write a report on my experiences.</sentence><sentence id="971">So I did, and I read it to the class, and then on the <span class="DLF">intercom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="972">An-And that way the children knew, because they wanted them to know what was going on over in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="973">But the children themselves weren't that concerned about it.</sentence><sentence id="974">They were interested in surviving themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1046">Q: Was there anything about the way the Americans were responding to the war that surprised you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1048">A: It was surprising that people here could go on so easily with their life when there was so much destruction going on over there, going on with their lives here.</sentence><sentence id="1049">But then in a way so did we.</sentence><sentence id="1050">We were lucky and we started living.</sentence><sentence id="1051">The only connection we had was the letters to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and back.</sentence><sentence id="1052">That's what made us aware of how terrible things had progressed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1081">Q: Did you get the sense from those letters that they were holding back and not telling you everything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1083">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Because they were kind of -- somewhat happy that w -- they were getting along day to day, and I suppose not to worry us, not to worry my mother and my aunts.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1117">Q: And how did you learn about all the -- the deaths over in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: When we contacted the American Red Cross and as far as I know they never could trace what happened to my family, so we just assumed that they died.</sentence><sentence id="1120">We don't know exactly how.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1147">A: All right, we heard a lot of it on the radio and we did go to the movies and we would see the newsreels and see what had happened and it was horrifying to see the actual pictures of the cons -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> people who had been just down to a shell of a person.</sentence><sentence id="1148">So that at that point after the war, we realized more how horrible and how horrific the whole thing had become.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And we never did find out what happened to my grandparents and my Aunt Ella.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1163">A: They were -- they were also horrified, but it hadn't affected them as badly because many of our Jewish friends had family who had gone through some of these times, so they were more inclined to feel the horror that had occurred, whereas some of our American friend who were not Jewish heard about it, but it wasn't as hurtful as it was to us.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: Did any of your loved ones or former neighbors or friends, any of them survive?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1169">A: Well, the friends that we saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, who left the <span class="RIVER">Oronoco</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, we never heard from them again, so as far as we know they were sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and died there.</sentence><sentence id="1170">I don't know of any survivors after that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
