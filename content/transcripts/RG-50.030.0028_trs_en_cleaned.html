<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Tell us about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Uh... remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news He may be using the Yiddish word "treife" here.</sentence><sentence id="156">was...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy.</sentence><sentence id="157">His name was Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and drummed up until all the people had come together, and now he said, "Hello, hello.</sentence><sentence id="158">This is the news..." and so on.</sentence><sentence id="159">He did say that a war started.</sentence><sentence id="160">Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and a mobilization is in order and...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, <span class="BUILDING">Mayor's office</span>, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="161">And he advised to glue in strips of paper on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> so they shouldn't shatter if the bombs fall down, and that was the news.</sentence><sentence id="162">So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in strips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="163">And later I remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming.</sentence><sentence id="164">I remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish plane</span> shot down, and the next I remember my family was moving out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, hiding in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from the bombs.</sentence><sentence id="165">We were afraid that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> will be bombed because there was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">military factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> uh producing material for fortification purposes.</sentence><sentence id="166">So I went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panska- Dolina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">Over there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the Soviet Union is fighting against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="168">I remember the speech from the Polish officer, that they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to the last drop of blood.</sentence><sentence id="169">And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and now we are a group of people about 25.</sentence><sentence id="170">We don't know what to do, scared in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">The young people say, "Oh, we will run away from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="172">We are going across the river Bug to the Russians."</sentence><sentence id="173">The older people, mine parents included...my father, "No, we're going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">Germans.</sentence><sentence id="175">Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people."</sentence><sentence id="176">And I remember we split then.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was in the night.</sentence><sentence id="178">I remember the stars and could be about maybe 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed.</sentence><sentence id="179">And the sons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And I went back with my parents.</sentence><sentence id="181">We come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> and now...uh.. (chuckle) interesting news.</sentence><sentence id="182">The Germans are leaving.</sentence><sentence id="183">So I said, "The Germans are leaving.</sentence><sentence id="184">I didn't see a German soldier.</sentence><sentence id="185">I must see a German soldier."</sentence><sentence id="186">So I went down looking for a German soldier. "</sentence><sentence id="187">Oh, there're two German soldiers still in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> buying bread."</sentence><sentence id="188">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and I seen in front of them two German soldiers with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because German is pretty close to Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="189">So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my language. (</sentence><sentence id="190">laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them.</sentence><sentence id="191">We did talk a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="192">| Yiddish and they're German.</sentence><sentence id="193">There's nothing wrong with it.</sentence><sentence id="194">And they left.</sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...A day later the Russians arrived.</sentence><sentence id="196">What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later did...did come to agreement about the...the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span>, and they moved out.</sentence><sentence id="197">And the Russians arrived.</sentence><sentence id="198">In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they were in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="199">The Russians are leaving again.</sentence><sentence id="200">The Germans are coming.</sentence><sentence id="201">So again what should we do?</sentence><sentence id="202">My mother told my father, "Listen, Let go out.</sentence><sentence id="203">I know Russian.</sentence><sentence id="204">I know the language.</sentence><sentence id="205">Let go out from here."</sentence><sentence id="206">And my father said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="207">Actually he bought a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="208">And later he said, "No, I was born here.</sentence><sentence id="209">I could die here."</sentence><sentence id="210">And my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way a Polish patriot.</sentence><sentence id="211">He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's army...uh...uh...in the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="212">He was wounded.</sentence><sentence id="213">He was a invalid.</sentence><sentence id="214">And...uh...which was, you know, a very horrible in that time.</sentence><sentence id="215">So he...and he said, no, he will stay here.</sentence><sentence id="216">He was born here and he...he could die here.</sentence><sentence id="217">And he stayed.</sentence><sentence id="218">And this was...and this sealed our future, our destiny.</sentence><sentence id="219">So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close by the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east.</sentence><sentence id="220">And I was a child 12 years old, but I felt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="221">We should go.</sentence><sentence id="222">But we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="223">The Russians left and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> was a no-man's land.</sentence><sentence id="224">No Russians.</sentence><sentence id="225">No Germans.</sentence><sentence id="226">The Germans did come.</sentence><sentence id="227">But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.984123" long="23.171871">Krasnystaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">Izbica was nobody.</sentence><sentence id="229">So two...the third night, sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I hear a big explosion.</sentence><sentence id="230">And suddenly screaming, yelling, "What's happened?"</sentence><sentence id="231">A group of Jews stood on the <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them.</sentence><sentence id="232">And they killed a few and they wounded a few.</sentence><sentence id="233">So we start to be terrorized by the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="234">So people were scared to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there's another legation did form, a Jewish delegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein.</sentence><sentence id="235">Still I remember her name.</sentence><sentence id="236">By the way, this is the same, this is my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat... shouldn't eat unkosher.</sentence><sentence id="237">Under...under her leadership, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.984123" long="23.171871">Krasnystaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">Actually, to invite Germans to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> because it...it is no law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> and we are afraid and that they must come in.</sentence><sentence id="239">So Germans did come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span> to protect the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="240">No, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days.</sentence><sentence id="241">There were simple Wehrmacht soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="242">And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local command...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so they were pretty quiet.</sentence><sentence id="243">As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="244">I remember a...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff.</sentence><sentence id="245">It...it was rather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived.</sentence><sentence id="246">There were two of them.</sentence><sentence id="247">Ludwig Klein and Karl Engels.</sentence><sentence id="248">Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">They both committed suicide in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> after the war, being in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">Well, anyway, these two SS were a terror in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five, ten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="252">It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized, finally, that we have no rights.</sentence><sentence id="253">And many times we wished that if the first Germans which arrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it would be a blessing because everybody would escape with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="254">You understand?</sentence><sentence id="255">In the beginning!But, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called.</sentence><sentence id="256">So...now it was too late, and we were in a trap.</sentence><sentence id="257">In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad.</sentence><sentence id="258">There were still families.</sentence><sentence id="259">Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was possible to live.</sentence><sentence id="260">There were...uh...there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and Jews were forced to go to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">In the beginning, they were forced to work on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> from 8 o'clock in the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">Later, as I said, there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> where they went out for a month or for a week.</sentence><sentence id="263">They worked.</sentence><sentence id="264">Later they...they were exchanged.</sentence><sentence id="265">New Jews did come and they were let <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">Uh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans in that time established Jewish Councils, so-called "Judenrat."</sentence><sentence id="267">And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their orders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and the Judenrat also after a month or so sent new people.</sentence><sentence id="268">The old ones...the first ones should be released.</sentence><sentence id="269">So it wasn't a order.</sentence><sentence id="270">Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for one month to the labor.</sentence><sentence id="271">But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the poor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go.</sentence><sentence id="272">But as the time progressed, it was worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="273">We heard about beating.</sentence><sentence id="274">We heard about torture, and people refused to go.</sentence><sentence id="275">In that time the first so-called "Aktions" happened. "</sentence><sentence id="276">Aktion" is a roundup.</sentence><sentence id="277">It started with roundups to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council to deliver 500 men or 200 men.</sentence><sentence id="279">If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their own police, they started indiscrimate to go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, beat, shot... Ukrainians, which worked with the Nazis together.</sentence><sentence id="280">And they...they caught...they simple caught people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> "til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away.</sentence></p></dialogue>

escape and another one.</sentence><sentence id="3348">It will drag on too long.</sentence><sentence id="3349">Because while over there, I...I survived a execution.</sentence><sentence id="3350">Two people escaped and the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> were cut, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> immediately notified the Germans and the Germans did come and Frenzel made immediately a roll call and he picked up every 10[th] person to be executed.</sentence><sentence id="3351">So this was story.</sentence><sentence id="3352">I could go on, so let's stop here.</sentence><sentence id="3353">I went through this.</sentence><sentence id="3354">Later a group working so-called "Wald"..."Waldkommando," working outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> cutting wood for the pyre, for the <span class="BUILDING">cremation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3355">They escaped.</sentence><sentence id="3356">They made a revolt.</sentence><sentence id="3357">And...uh...later...uh...they caught a lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="3358">They brought them back, and I was witnessing their execution.</sentence><sentence id="3359">Things like that which I could talk a whole day and night.</sentence><sentence id="3360">But I will go now to the revolt.</sentence><sentence id="3361">Or a little bit about myself.</sentence><sentence id="3362">Being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>, I always did want to escape.</sentence><sentence id="3363">And I...for...for some strange reason, I always felt I will survive.</sentence><sentence id="3364">I had always something in me that I will survive.</sentence><sentence id="3365">But I was looking.</sentence><sentence id="3366">Once they did need people to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">W_odawa</span> to take apart some <span class="BUILDING">bakeries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3367">They did need fireproof bricks.</sentence><sentence id="3368">So the...the Germans asked for volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="3369">Who wants to go?</sentence><sentence id="3370">So I did go.</sentence><sentence id="3371">Thinking that maybe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">W_odawa</span> I will be able to run away.</sentence><sentence id="3372">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">W_odawa</span> was a situation that even the fellow prisoners did...did watch me because they did know if I escape or anybody else escape, they would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="3373">So one watched another one.</sentence><sentence id="3374">We weren't able...but what's happened over there...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, sorting some stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3375">You 4 could see them from far away.</sentence><sentence id="3376">And while working, when we were able to get closer to them, we showed them that we are hiding money for them.</sentence><sentence id="3377">So we...we have done it for about week, leaving money in the ruins of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to help the...the W_odawa girls.</sentence><sentence id="3378">Nevertheless, most of them were later brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3379">This didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="3380">Later was the...the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>...Waldkommander thought maybe I could work over there.</sentence><sentence id="3381">In the beginning, it was very nice because I had a method.</sentence><sentence id="3382">I noticed that the Germans like clean people.</sentence><sentence id="3383">They like people going straight fast.</sentence><sentence id="3384">The moment you see a run..rundown Jews, broken-down Jew, they killing him.</sentence><sentence id="3385">So always I kept myself clean.</sentence><sentence id="3386">I put even my pants under me when I slept.</sentence><sentence id="3387">They should be ironed with my body, straight.</sentence><sentence id="3388">I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I could go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3389">But I always looked a open <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3390">So I did go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> for the Waldkommando.</sentence><sentence id="3391">The foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3392">You could come me."</sentence><sentence id="3393">We cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3394">Later, ...uh...they're building a <span class="DLF">road</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="3395">And the German noticed me, Dachsler (ph), old German.</sentence><sentence id="3396">And he said, "Listen, Kleiner, take a...take this group of people and go cut straight <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> because we need it for the <span class="DLF">road</span> to put on top."</sentence><sentence id="3397">So I had a group of people and...uh...and this was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work because this German didn't beat.</sentence><sentence id="3398">So anyway, going farther...so my way of surviving was stay away from the German.</sentence><sentence id="3399">If you sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, take a...a...a...a...<span class="NPIP">place</span> far away from the <span class="DLF">entrance door</span>, right in the corner, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> even if you need to crawl...to...to it's difficult to get up, do it.</sentence><sentence id="3400">Keep yourself clean.</sentence><sentence id="3401">Keep yourself straight.</sentence><sentence id="3402">You see a German, go somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="3403">And...uh...and...uh... a lot of miracles.</sentence><sentence id="3404">And this way I was existing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3405">Uh...What also it was, I made a deal with a guy who sorted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3406">Because you sort <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>, you could make labyrinths.</sentence><sentence id="3407">And I was sorting food.</sentence><sentence id="3408">So I told him, "Listen, I bring you some food.</sentence><sentence id="3409">You let me rest in your <span class="DLF">labyrinth</span> to eat."</sentence><sentence id="3410">So I was ...uh...taking a few canned food to him, and I was eating; and later he was happy and I was happy because I was always tired and sleepy.</sentence><sentence id="3411">Over there was a chance.</sentence><sentence id="3412">I will skip little stories like this, but why I mention about this guy because he will come up again.</sentence><sentence id="3413">Once in the middle of the night, my friend shaking, "Tom.</sentence><sentence id="3414">Listen.</sentence><sentence id="3415">Listen.</sentence><sentence id="3416">What's happened?"</sentence><sentence id="3417">What's happened, he...he had a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3418">And the one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3419">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open, and I heard some talking <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, so I did get up.</sentence><sentence id="3420">I've seen something is going on, and I did go to my friend in the [bank (ph)] kommando.</sentence><sentence id="3421">And I go to him, and it was dark in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because what I know in which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> he is, and I tell him, "Listen, Shmufel], Hear what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="3422">Something...something is happening here."</sentence><sentence id="3423">So instead to answer me, he hit me in my face with a...with something...some kind of metal, I know.</sentence><sentence id="3424">So I thought "If he knows and he doesn't care, it's okay."</sentence><sentence id="3425">So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to escape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too.</sentence><sentence id="3426">Anyway, I told you.</sentence><sentence id="3427">But again, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a whole group of kapos being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3428">So I was wondering what's happened?</sentence><sentence id="3429">But again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used to sort <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>, has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was obvious that he did betray the action.</sentence><sentence id="3430">But to make it short again, we killed him later.</sentence><sentence id="3431">Before 5 we made the revolt.</sentence><sentence id="3432">He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3638">Q: Tell us about the revolt.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3640">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3641">Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die.</sentence><sentence id="3642">When...uh...even if the...the war would stop right now and then the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> could be free, we will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="3643">So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us.</sentence><sentence id="3644">Everybody did want to escape.</sentence><sentence id="3645">I think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind.</sentence><sentence id="3646">Although some people were resigned.</sentence><sentence id="3647">They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even with this terrible situation did pray.</sentence><sentence id="3648">I remember Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="3649">And they did fast, and they did say all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in God and their tradition everything else.</sentence><sentence id="3650">Now, there always was... wouldn't say organization...there were a few people, influenced people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>...respected people.</sentence><sentence id="3651">It was a Hazzan, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3652">I don't remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="3653">And was Leon Feldhandler.</sentence><sentence id="3654">His father was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zolkiewka</span>, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3655">And there were some talks...talks about the revolt.</sentence><sentence id="3656">I was close to Feldhandler because he was a friend of my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3657">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3658">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica ghetto</span> in the time when I escaped to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stryy</span>, and they caught me in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3659">But it wasn't until a transport from the Soviet Union arrived.</sentence><sentence id="3660">When the <span class="REGION">Eastern Front</span> was coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3661">And that time they took all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.883333" long="25.3">Lida</span> and they brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3662">I mean not all of them.</sentence><sentence id="3663">A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3664">And in that...in this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="3665">Soviet prisoners of war, Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3666">Because they recognized as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3667">In that time we had a lot of work and the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3668">Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWs trained in the art of fighting.</sentence><sentence id="3669">Former soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="3670">And they picked up a man called Pechersky.</sentence><sentence id="3671">He was a officer in the Soviet Army, and ...to work with us.</sentence><sentence id="3672">Pretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon Feldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want to dwell much on it, they formed a organization.</sentence><sentence id="3673">From that time on some concrete things happened.</sentence><sentence id="3674">I find out about a week before about the revolt.</sentence><sentence id="3675">Uh...That time I was working as a Feuermann.</sentence><sentence id="3676">How did I come to be...to get this job?</sentence><sentence id="3677">Feuermann is like firemeister...master.</sentence><sentence id="3678">All the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was burned.</sentence><sentence id="3679">While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket.</sentence><sentence id="3680">Later with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire.</sentence><sentence id="3681">Taking it to the fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there.</sentence><sentence id="3682">Did bring him some food.</sentence><sentence id="3683">And slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>, I was working over there as a steady personnel.</sentence><sentence id="3684">My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of 6 the view from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3685">I could see them.</sentence><sentence id="3686">They can't see me.</sentence><sentence id="3687">From the <span class="DLF">window</span>, I was able to see.</sentence><sentence id="3688">But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating.</sentence><sentence id="3689">But anyway, so...they planned to kill a German in my <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3690">So this way...but I did need to be contacted.</sentence><sentence id="3691">Otherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, I would chase him out, being afraid myself.</sentence><sentence id="3692">So he calls me in the evening and tells me, "Toivi, I must tell you something.</sentence><sentence id="3693">I know you.</sentence><sentence id="3694">I know your father.</sentence><sentence id="3695">I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut.</sentence><sentence id="3696">We need your <span class="NPIP">place</span> to kill a German."</sentence><sentence id="3697">I was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="3698">Later, I find out about what's happened.</sentence><sentence id="3699">And I was informed on the purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3700">I... understood that something is going on, and I was informed about Sasha.</sentence><sentence id="3701">Especially I was a guy... was a guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> which always did run around.</sentence><sentence id="3702">You know, I didn't keep in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3703">I was always hyper and would just run.</sentence><sentence id="3704">I did want to know everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything.</sentence><sentence id="3705">So in this way I did become, I was involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="3706">So I know the first plan was...there were different plans.</sentence><sentence id="3707">The first plan was to dig a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">blacksmith shop</span> through the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> to <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3708">But when they analyzed it, it's did come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very dangerous dispose of the soil.</sentence><sentence id="3709">They need to find a way.</sentence><sentence id="3710">And when...let's assume everything is okay.</sentence><sentence id="3711">Six hundred people should go through the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> single file without quarrel will take a whole night.</sentence><sentence id="3712">Isn't practical.</sentence><sentence id="3713">They threw it away.</sentence><sentence id="3714">The next one was to poison...to kill all the Nazis while they're in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called "putzers," which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to the Germans and while they are in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3715">This time to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and get their weapons.</sentence><sentence id="3716">But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they didn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job.</sentence><sentence id="3717">Anyway, a plan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between four and five.</sentence><sentence id="3718">We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality.</sentence><sentence id="3719">Discipline.</sentence><sentence id="3720">And the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in conjunction of the extermination, there were workshops.</sentence><sentence id="3721">Tailors, shoemakers working for the Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force.</sentence><sentence id="3722">Why not?</sentence><sentence id="3723">So they established a few small <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="3724">And always a German have something...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> should make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for appointments between 4 and 5 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="3725">And over there there would be some people which will... which will kill them.</sentence><sentence id="3726">So I know about this plan.</sentence><sentence id="3727">And this should happen between 4 and 5, and the whole lager should look normal.</sentence><sentence id="3728">We should not...we should not use the weapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time.</sentence><sentence id="3729">I remember I was in that time waiting and mine fire place...in <span class="NPIP">mine place</span>...where I burned 7 ..where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="3730">I pushed all these papers against the <span class="DLF">window</span> so nobody should be able to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents, papers, we threw in in the sides, and the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> was in the middle, and I just later burn it.</sentence><sentence id="3731">So anyway was a <span class="DLF">window</span> so I blocked the <span class="DLF">window</span> and was waiting.</sentence><sentence id="3732">And..uh...now I see a group...uh ... because they were divided.</sentence><sentence id="3733">The organization had about six fighting groups of three people and located in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> waiting for the Germans to be lured over there.</sentence><sentence id="3734">So I see the group is supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>, but they're passing me.</sentence><sentence id="3735">They're going in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="3736">So I was panicky, but pretty soon a Jew called....from _6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, "Tom, they decide not to do anything to your <span class="NPIP">place</span> because the guard...the tower guard was very close."</sentence><sentence id="3737">I was very close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be suspicious. "</sentence><sentence id="3738">We rather...we'll kill him in the <span class="BUILDING">men's storeroom</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3739">Then he told me to go over there, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the <span class="DLF">gate</span> leading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so- called four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4.</sentence><sentence id="3740">In Lager 1 were the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they used to sleep and these <span class="BUILDING">workshop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3741">Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were building something over there.</sentence><sentence id="3742">So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this <span class="DLF">gate</span> was very close to the <span class="BUILDING">storeroom</span> I just seen them both coming in.</sentence><sentence id="3743">He was called in..in to try on a leather jacket, because it exactly his size.</sentence><sentence id="3744">And he did go in and suspected nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3745">While he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen.</sentence><sentence id="3746">This...the moment he was killed, he did come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming in, the Jewish prisoner said, "Achtung!"</sentence><sentence id="3747">immediately.
