<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Would you stop for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="86">What do you mean; what scholarship did you win?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: I took -- the scholarship that I won, it was -- they had statewide scholarship.</sentence><sentence id="88">They had a test in math, in history and in geography.</sentence><sentence id="89">I was the youngest one, because I made seven grades in four years.</sentence><sentence id="90">So -- but I won in all three: In math, and history, and geography.</sentence><sentence id="91">So then they said that they would give me a special admission to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> free -- for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> free.</sentence><sentence id="92">But my parents were so religious that our boys did not go to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">My brother went away.</sentence><sentence id="95">He went to <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> and visits the Rabbi, <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">He become a Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="97">And the girls went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">So when I won the scholarship -- and my father said to my mother: We're not sending her.</sentence><sentence id="99">If they are sending her, let her learn.</sentence><sentence id="100">Because my father did not speak the language, because when he was born it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">Then he was in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> where he picked up a little English, and he came back it was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">So wherever he went, I went along with him, because he didn't know what he was signing.</sentence><sentence id="103">The language was altogether different.</sentence><sentence id="104">From Hungarian to Romanian, it's a different -- altogether.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="123"><span class="COUNTRY">Romanian</span> is Latin, and Hungarian is a different language.</sentence><sentence id="124">So I used to go along with him, and he used to kid around, and he said: Here comes my lawyer, to let me know if I could read it or not, or to sign it or not.</sentence><sentence id="125">She will read it to me, and then I'll sign that if I could sign it or not.</sentence><sentence id="126">When <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> came, we were a little happy from the beginning, because we figured there wouldn't be no more the iron guard.</sentence><sentence id="127">My mother remembered that she was born in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>; that the Hungarian people were pretty nice people.</sentence><sentence id="128">And it was all right from 1940 until 1941.</sentence><sentence id="129">In 1941 it became a new law.</sentence><sentence id="130">Jewish people weren't allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">So my scholarship, first of all, wasn't good any more, because from -- <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> become <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I had to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and start with A, B, C. A different language altogether.</sentence><sentence id="133">After learning one year, we were expelled.</sentence><sentence id="134">We had to wear a Jewish star, and it was forbidden for Jews to go at night out, and to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> altogether.</sentence><sentence id="135">So I went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that time, and I started to learn a trade, because my father, to rest in peace, he always said: No matter how much money you have, you always have to know a trade, and you have to know to do even for -- we had a girl coming in to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>, she used to make us all do something to make sure that we all knew how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="136">In the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we were a lot of children.</sentence><sentence id="137">Some of them were away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshivas</span>, but we were a happy family.</sentence><sentence id="138">Like my father was working, he was a blacksmith.</sentence><sentence id="139">So in the beginning he used to work with 12-13 people, because he had people coming from all over for the backsmith work, and also was making the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">At that time there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> were made with wood, and he used to carve the wheels, but he -- he practiced, and he knew very well to make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">He had workers in that department, and then he went in the other <span class="REGION">department</span> where he used to put shoes on horses, and he put the iron and the wheels from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">When <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> came over, he was still doing that, and even towards the end he was working.</sentence><sentence id="144">In 1942 the situation got really bad.</sentence><sentence id="145">Everything was rationed: Milk, flour, sugar.</sentence><sentence id="146">You were allowed to get one pair of sole in your shoes one year.</sentence><sentence id="147">Everything that we had was sent to the Army, or even but -- what we didn't have -- if we didn't have it, they told you you had to deliver that.</sentence><sentence id="148">We had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and buy it, and deliver it for pennies.</sentence><sentence id="149">But being you were a Jew, you had no other choice.</sentence><sentence id="150">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> compared to the rest of the people there, because my father when he came from the <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, after he couldn't -- wasn't able to come here, he bought <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">And he bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so we had a six-room <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">So they taxed everybody according to their property.</sentence><sentence id="153">So, we had <span class="REGION">acreage</span> that they used to give out for people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to work on it, and whenever they came out with the corn or with the wheat, we used to share it.</sentence><sentence id="154">Half was there for the labor and the other <span class="NPIP">half</span> was for us, because we keep the <span class="REGION">land</span>, and we give them the seeds for it.</sentence><sentence id="155">Then they taxed them to such an extent that it wouldn't pay to give it out to workers.</sentence><sentence id="156">He finally give it to the workers, and the workers used to give us wheat or whatever from -- just for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, but the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was written over to them.</sentence><sentence id="157">Then in 1942 it came around the Jews were paying more taxes than anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="158">If you made money or you didn't make it, they tax you.</sentence><sentence id="159">So one day they came in and they said: You have a six-room <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">You have to pay so much and so much.</sentence><sentence id="161">My father, he should rest in peace, took a hammer and made five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> out of it.</sentence><sentence id="162">He knocked the <span class="DLF">hole</span> out.</sentence><sentence id="163">He says: You see, now I only have five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">He says my taxes -- because it was impossible to pay the taxes.</sentence><sentence id="165">No matter how well you were, in the end you become poor, because no matter what you have, it wasn't enough.</sentence><sentence id="166">Then everything was rationed.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I started -- I started to play the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">I used to buy stuff and take it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where everything was available for money.</sentence><sentence id="169">And I become very friendly with the head of the police, the captain of the police, and he was Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="170">There we had two kind of police in there.</sentence><sentence id="171">Some of them were called Rangles (ck) and some of them where called Chandles (ck).</sentence><sentence id="172">The Rangles (ck) were the local ones, that it was established there.</sentence><sentence id="173">The Chandles were coming from other <span class="NPIP">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">Once I got arrested.</sentence><sentence id="175">We didn't know -- I spent the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> when I was 12 years old, because two people rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Everything was reserved for the Army.</sentence><sentence id="177">I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="178">I rode from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the three miles.</sentence><sentence id="179">A fellow pass by and he says: You want a lift <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="180">And I was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, the Chandles (ck) come, they saw us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">We both spend the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because we rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">Whatever we did we didn't even know, because there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">There was no newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="184">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="185">Everything was forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="186">Not only for the Jews, for the public.</sentence><sentence id="187">The news there was like this: One guy went on the drum and announced this time everybody has to take the cows out, or things, because they're coming to take for the Army whatever they want.</sentence><sentence id="188">So we had buffaloes.</sentence><sentence id="189">Trained -- you know, trained buffaloes that the milk was very, very good from them.</sentence><sentence id="190">And I used to do <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I used to take them everything from eggs, sugar, zachery (ck), anything that you could normally disguise by wood by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">They used to buy us things to make the matzos.</sentence><sentence id="193">For Pesach -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Purim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>, they used to bake in our large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they used -- lunch for where my father made.</sentence><sentence id="194">We'd make matzos for the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">Everything was available for money that we made from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">So I befriended myself with the head of the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">And in order for me to be able to do that, I used to give him percentage.</sentence><sentence id="198">He used to get milk, eggs, chickens.</sentence><sentence id="199">Anything that I dealed with, he used to get.</sentence><sentence id="200">We become very good friends.</sentence><sentence id="201">As a matter of fact, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he told me: Look, the situation is getting very bad.</sentence><sentence id="202">You leave.</sentence><sentence id="203">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I told them the story.</sentence><sentence id="204">Nobody wanted to believe me.</sentence><sentence id="205">They said: How in the world can you say?</sentence><sentence id="206">We were comfortable just like here.</sentence><sentence id="207">We work.</sentence><sentence id="208">We gather money that somebody's going to come and take you away.</sentence><sentence id="209">Nobody wanted to believe it.</sentence><sentence id="210">I said: Look, remember when it was forbidden to kill for kosher, only once a week.</sentence><sentence id="211">And my uncle, my mother's brother was a butcher, and they caught him killing for -- slaughtering the meat for kosher in a different day.</sentence><sentence id="212">So the Rabbi that slaughter it and my uncle was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="213">So I went to the captain, my friend, and they got off from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">I said: Look, remember when I got them off from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, because he knows me, he told me -- he done favors for me, because I do favors for him.</sentence><sentence id="215">Whatever I give him, I didn't take any money, because if I would have take the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> money, I would have been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="216">And for the money that I give it to him, it didn't pay, because it's like for five dollars to five cents, so I figure it's better I give him a gift than to charge him.</sentence><sentence id="217">So, Friday before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started, he told me: Look, you are 40 miles from the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell your parents to pack and leave.</sentence><sentence id="219">Well, Friday I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said to my mother and father: Look, the friend of mine, the captain says: The situation is very bad and it's getting worse.</sentence><sentence id="220">One, we have a chance.</sentence><sentence id="221">We should go over 40 miles to the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">My father had two brothers that lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, because when we were there it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>; and he had a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">He said: Take whatever you can and leave.</sentence><sentence id="224">When I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told -- my mother and my father, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> Friday night and Saturday, and they discussed it.</sentence><sentence id="225">Well, they said: Now I think she is going too far.</sentence><sentence id="226">I know she has connections.</sentence><sentence id="227">I know she took us out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">I know that whatever she is planning she could do, and he goes along with her, but this is a little too far.</sentence><sentence id="229">You see, when he said that, everybody was staying put.</sentence><sentence id="230">The Rabbi said, the shucta (ck) said to stay put.</sentence><sentence id="231">So it came Tuesday morning, when we started to bring people from -- for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">We were only three and a half miles to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="233">We walked.</sentence><sentence id="234">The other people, that they were further, the Chandles (ck) used to take them in little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and take families.</sentence><sentence id="235">So I said to my mother Tuesday morning, I say: You see, you didn't believe me.</sentence><sentence id="236">You see already they are taking these people.</sentence><sentence id="237">So my mother used to say: Well, they were business people.</sentence><sentence id="238">Maybe they did something wrong and they caught them, and they're taking them for questioning.</sentence><sentence id="239">I didn't want do Tuesday morning nothing, no chores around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, because we had to feed the ducks, the chickens, the cows.</sentence><sentence id="240">Everything everybody had -- you know, when you were a large family, everybody had the chores before they go any <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">I says: I'm not doing nothing.</sentence><sentence id="242">I said: You wait and you will see what's going to happen here.</sentence><sentence id="243">So finally they knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they say, you have five minutes to get whatever you want.</sentence><sentence id="244">Give me your jewelry and give me your money, and be ready in five minutes.</sentence><sentence id="245">We -- my mother at that time looked at me, and I didn't say nothing.</sentence><sentence id="246">So we packed little things that you take: A blanket, a pot, a milchig pot, a fleishig pot.</sentence><sentence id="247">And my father was doing the horses, too, for the Germans, because we had two Germans that lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">Two officers lived in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">It was even -- if we had only five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, it was still the biggest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">So whenever an officer came, they used to say -- there was no <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> -- your <span class="INT_SPACE">master bedroom</span> was taken.</sentence><sentence id="251">My mother and father had to get out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and they were there for a month, living there because they had maneuvers.</sentence><sentence id="252">This was German people, officers.</sentence><sentence id="253">They were very polite.</sentence><sentence id="254">They were staying in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">My father was taking care of the horses, and they used to like our cooking.</sentence><sentence id="256">My mother used to cook them breakfast and everything, and they used to pay us for it, and they enjoyed the home cooking.</sentence><sentence id="257">They never said anything.</sentence><sentence id="258">My father, they were waiting until he finished the horses, to shoe the horses, and then they gathered us in one big, in a big <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">And they said when they gathered the whole group we start marching to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which was approximately four and a half miles.</sentence></p></dialogue>
