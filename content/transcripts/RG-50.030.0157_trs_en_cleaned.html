<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: What most stands out in your mind from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Is (sigh) (long pause) The things that stands out most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> is the helplessness of the people.</sentence><sentence id="194">And the good in the people.</sentence><sentence id="195">And some of it the bad in the people.</sentence><sentence id="196">I feel the heroism that there were for caring for one another in the midst of death, and I also can remember the bad of people against each other because of this situation.</sentence><sentence id="197">That's why I say in a situations like this, you get the best and you get the worst.</sentence><sentence id="198">And the most outstanding, the most memorable thing that I have and the most horrifying thing is when we had to go and to be to stand in appell and you see they would have proclamation and they would say this and this section have to go to this and this <span class="DLF">field</span>, and we never knew which <span class="DLF">line</span> would come back.</sentence><sentence id="199">It would be one would say left, one right, and it became apparent that if one family stood together very rarely would they take the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="200">They may just leave one member or two and now as an adult, I could see what was so easy to break the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="201">Because when you are in situation where they take your mother or your brother or your sister, how do you feel?</sentence><sentence id="202">I mean the kind of psychologically what you're going through in your mind and how you feel about, you don't almost care what happens to you.</sentence><sentence id="203">You want to be with that person.</sentence><sentence id="204">And...uh...so it became apparent how to outsmart them is to separate, not to stand together as a family and...uh... and that was something that I will never forget when...uh...we had...we finally were separated.</sentence><sentence id="205">My brother was taken and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, and we were taken in...into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and... uh...we were shipped...we were going...we were standing up like sardines in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and not...and they always seemed to be doing it on the worst raining or dreary or snowy days...uh...hot days...uh...and those are the kinds that ...that stands out.</sentence><sentence id="206">The other thing that stands out in my mind, I remember when we...we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived in...uh...there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we had to share with about nine families in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there was hardly any kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and this one person who was...uh...with the...uh... with the Jewish police and...uh...he gave, evidently, my name to be taken instead of his child...uh...and...uh... two other children and I happened not to be in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when they came to take me, and they took his child instead of me, and he came back and he started throwing things and hitting me and screaming at my mother and that I was supposed to go instead of his daughter.</sentence><sentence id="207">So incidents like that and...uh... never leaves your mind, you know, and...uh...you feel helpless, and you're constantly in a state of helplessness.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="226">Uh...My cousins and my aunts and uncles all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Josvani</span> and some lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiddon</span> and they were all massacred.</sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I found out that about 147 members of my family were taken out to a flield and they were all shot.</sentence><sentence id="228">And how I know is a cousin who was with them who...uh...thought that he was...they thought that he was killed...he was shot...was shot and was able to crawl out from wherever he was on the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and crawl and practically on his belly and he collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="229">Uh...They...in a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span>, and the people took pity on him and he stayed there all through the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.901111" long="23.979444">Kaunas</span> and he got married and my brother brought them to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he just died about 2 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="230">And he told me.</sentence><sentence id="231">That's how I knew that the whole family... The first thing after we survived, we looked for all the family, and there was hardly any, except a distant cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and this man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: How long did you consider...Were you as a child smuggling food in and out all this time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="242">Quite...quite a bit, and...uh...a number of times and...uh...my mother did not know in the very beginning and my brother tells me stories that he was asked to join the Partisans and he had a chance to escape, but he wanted my older sister to go with him and she wouldn't go and leave my mother and me, and so they stayed.</sentence><sentence id="243">Uh...It's that kind of heroism and unselfishness that you want to, you know, to hold on to one's family whatever was...was left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
