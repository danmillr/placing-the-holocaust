<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: When my parents were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="7">I'm really not very clear about my age, we had no documents, we had nothing, but when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alshanka(ph</span>), I was a few years old.</sentence><sentence id="8">I don't exactly know, a few years old.</sentence><sentence id="9">I know when they were killed I was seven.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: But still you waited for them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: Yes, it's very strange what, I don't understand psychologically, yes I waited for them.</sentence><sentence id="17">I mean, strange things remind us.</sentence><sentence id="18">First I waited for them, knowing when they were dead and I also knew the circumstances of their death, but then for the rest of my adult life, not for the rest, until twenty something, I completely eliminated the thought of them ever being there, like I eliminated the fact that I had parents.</sentence><sentence id="19">I don't understand it, maybe that was the way of surviving the trauma.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: I need you to help clarify some chronology for me, because I'm a little confused.</sentence><sentence id="25">You were born <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kleinfeldt(ph</span>)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Oh yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Because you saw it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="38">Well, like I could hear the sound of the guns and I, on some subconscious level, knew that they were my parents because I had reactions, I suddenly couldn't walk, so that was unusual for a child a few years old, so that was immediate reaction to this, yeah, I knew they were not there any more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: So we're at that day, you're standing and waiting for them to come, do you remember what you were wearing, do you remember what it looked like that day, what it smelled like that day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: This is after the war, you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Mm-hm, do you remember that day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: No, I only remember that the band was playing and everybody was happy, greeting whoever returned and I waited until the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> already left and I was still waiting and I was very sad.</sentence><sentence id="48">I actually forgot that moment, it just came to me recently, during some activities, that also the band was playing and suddenly the moment came to me.</sentence><sentence id="49">Usually</sentence><sentence id="51">Edwarda Rorat 5 February 25, 1996 Page 5 when I talk about those things I feel like my larynx is opposing me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Do you remember what the band was playing?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Were people singing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Oh, I am sure, yes, it was sort of a happy moment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Were you by yourself or were you with other people?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: So you were a 10 year old, standing there alone, with all these people celebrating?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Let's see, 10?</sentence><sentence id="78">Probably not 10 yet.</sentence><sentence id="79">But I don't know if you understand what being Jewish was, I mean, that was something like being a cockroach or something, I don't know what to compare it to.</sentence><sentence id="80">These people are very anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="81">So no, I was usually alone.</sentence><sentence id="82">That was nothing different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: How long did you wait there with everybody?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Probably a few hours.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Then what?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: So tell me what, the war is over, you're no longer. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: In hiding.</sentence><sentence id="100">Yes, no more in hiding and I was this family, old, sick, uneducated people who</sentence><sentence id="102">Edwarda Rorat 6 February 25, 1996 Page 6 saved my life and who are poor, who work hard, and I also work hard with them.</sentence><sentence id="103">I know that to, I mean it was clear that to win her approval was to work, efficiently and I was needed, they were poor people, so I was always working and no playing, really.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: What kind of work did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Oh, in the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, taking care of their cow and finding a <span class="DLF">pasture</span> for the cow, because they did not have land of their own, so I spent lots of time with the cow alone in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">And being eight and later nine or so, preparing food for them when the worked.</sentence><sentence id="113">I had to stand on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> to reach the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, I was very small and I stopped growing.</sentence><sentence id="114">So I cooked for them, I cleaned, took care of the little tiny <span class="BUILDING">store</span> they had, the grocery, so thats type of work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: At that time, were you aware of what it meant, that the war was over?</sentence><sentence id="120">Did you know that you were no longer in hiding from that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="124">I didn't see any Germans any more and I didn't hide any more, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: What did that feel like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: It felt much safer, but I pretty much, I was pretty much used to danger already.</sentence><sentence id="130">I mean each time I saw Germans, I knew this meant a possible death for me, or possible for the people who are saving me, but my life was always in danger, a peasant could kill me, I understood that being Jewish was the worst thing on earth, so I was pretty much used to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: So when you no longer had to feel that way and had to feel like you had to hide who you were, did that open something in you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: I really don't know, because I don't think I knew how to be happy, how to celebrate</sentence><sentence id="137">Edwarda Rorat 7 February 25, 1996 Page 7 something.</sentence><sentence id="138">I still was pretty, on the same level, serious-looking kid.</sentence><sentence id="139">I didn't cry, but I didn't laugh either.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: So you didn't go out to the cow and say to the cow, look we're free, let's run off together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Probably not.</sentence><sentence id="149">I really didn't, I don't remember being really a child.</sentence><sentence id="150">As far as being a child I only know that I cuddled the cow.</sentence><sentence id="151">That was like feeling she was my mother, probably.</sentence><sentence id="152">But otherwise being pretty serious.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Even when you had the chance to lighten up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: I don't really remember moments like that.</sentence><sentence id="161">That's why I don't exactly know how to play.</sentence><sentence id="162">I was in some retreat, can I digress now?</sentence><sentence id="163">I was in some retreat, people obviously with psychological problem go there and the game was to play like little children.</sentence><sentence id="164">The instruction was go on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and play like little children and for a moment I said, I wanted to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they said, where are you going, and I said, I don't know how to play, I really mean it, so I don't want to spoil it to other people.</sentence><sentence id="165">So there, I know it is the grown up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> on their fours and they were hilarious, how they start playing Edwarda Rorat 8 February 25, 1996 Page 8 I was just listening, and I didn't want to share but they really ask me to, so then I say, sorry, but I never had toys, I slept in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or somewhere else outdoor, I had no toys.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I was that a few months later, my birthday, big teddy bear arrived, it's over Edwarda Rorat 9 February 25, 1996 Page 9 taking children and they wanted to take me, but I was so much attached already to these people and I already was becoming anti-Semitic myself, that I did not have desire to leave them, actually I didn't want to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: What were these people's names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rorat</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Oh, these were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rorats</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Yes, the first family, we didn't talk about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="186">Did they formerly adopt you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="190">Rorat, that's how my name became.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: When that happened, did you decide at that point you were no longer a Kleinfeldt(ph)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Actually I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) during the war, they changed my name to disguise the Jewishness, so I had some other name, Alshevska(ph), it was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, so they gave it to me, so I was no longer Kleinfeldt(ph) any way, I was Alshevska(ph), just any name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: So when you were a kid and at that point when you didn't have to hide any more, what was your identity, who did you think you were, who were you for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: This was difficult, but I don't think I had time, or thought much about it, I mean, with the first family, my only occupation was to keep alive and somehow withstand the abuse.</sentence><sentence id="200">With this family I wanted to be helpful, so I was either working, doing something with them, and then I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so my life was pretty busy.</sentence><sentence id="201">I don't think I thought much about</sentence><sentence id="203">Edwarda Rorat 10 February 25, 1996 Page 10 my identity or anything and most likely I tried to block my past, most likely because I did realize sometime later on, that I eliminated my parents entirely, so most likely I also try not to think of anything much.</sentence><sentence id="204">I don't know what a child does.</sentence><sentence id="205">Maybe this is survival methods.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Did you identify with being Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well the people reminded me of this every moment of my life.</sentence><sentence id="216">Not only that I'm Jewish, but that I'm scabby Jewish, it doesn't translate exactly into English, does it?</sentence><sentence id="217">Scabby, lousy, rotten, dirty Jew, all those things.</sentence><sentence id="218">So yes, I did know I was different, I was Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: So at the point that you didn't have to hide this any more, was that at least a feeling for you of, like the equivalent of coming out, of saying okay, yes I'm a Jew and yes that's fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No, I never thought was fine, because nobody else thought it was fine and I did not think it was fine.</sentence><sentence id="226">I actually felt very inferior, very ugly, very inferior.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: You were saying that there were efforts made after the war, on different Jewish organizations, what was going on that you were aware of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, I had my sister, not with me, but she was already with Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, which is the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and she wrote me that we have an opportunity to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and possibly go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but I was separated with my sister, we were not close and now her asking me to join her wasn't, it wasn't, I don't know, it didn't mean as much to me as being with this woman who was taking care of me.</sentence><sentence id="232">I didn't want to hurt her feelings and somehow I was not very much concerned with my sister.</sentence><sentence id="233">I knew that she will do all right, she was older than I, stronger and everything and maybe their methods were not the best, the</sentence><sentence id="235">Edwarda Rorat 11 February 25, 1996 Page 11 people who came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to talk me into leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, leaving my adoptive parents.</sentence><sentence id="236">They didn't talk to me, I mean, they tried to kidnap me because they knew I don't want to leave, so they either tried to kidnap, or if they contacted me they were saying the worst things about the villagers, so that didn't play with me, so no, so that's why I didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="237">I didn't leave them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: How long did you stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: I mean, in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> 13, 14, but later there were no more <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, even to that age, I have to walk several miles to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in that little <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but at 14 there was not even enough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the next, I don't know how you call it, next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and so I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> and then I them very early, so that I was with them Edwarda Rorat 12 February 25, 1996 Page 12 was the only Jewish kid in the class and he hated my guts.</sentence><sentence id="249">He absolutely couldn't stand me.</sentence><sentence id="250">He was a cruel person altogether, he used to beat up the other children.</sentence><sentence id="251">But I was so good in learning, in behaving, in everything, that he'd no excuse to hit me, there was no excuse and he absolutely couldn't stand a Jewess, so he continuously used to just call me something, it was sarcastic, it was unpleasant and eventually he did hit me.</sentence><sentence id="252">And that was the time I could not be hit any more, that was sort of a saturation point in my life.</sentence><sentence id="253">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said I will not go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again, that's why I had to march several miles to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, rather than going to this one.</sentence><sentence id="254">So it was pretty difficult for a few years old child to go through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, not a single person there.</sentence><sentence id="255">I had to leave early, before sunrise, I mean it was dark and go by myself.</sentence><sentence id="256">There were wild animals around and walk, so I wasn't easy.</sentence><sentence id="257">And then after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the same thing, walking several miles by myself, but the good thought was that studying always came very easy to me compared to the other children that it did feel good to be a good student and my adoptive parents were very proud of me.</sentence><sentence id="258">But that again, it really, nothing was ever simple.</sentence><sentence id="259">When I was too good there, the children were jealous and they also could call me, oh she's so good because she's Jewish and almost being the best student was almost like an insult that that's because Jews, you know, they are so manipulative and so shrewd and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="260">They turn it in .</sentence><sentence id="261">The teachers like me, but Edwarda Rorat 13 February 25, 1996 Page 13 they felt I have to be educated.</sentence><sentence id="262">They believe in that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: What about the parents of the other children, was there any resentment by them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="285">The other children had hard time learning.</sentence><sentence id="286">I suppose because of my background I had it easier, my parents were educated and that probably was in my genes.</sentence><sentence id="287">So I had it real easy, I was delayed with my schooling because of the war and the way I was catching up, I was practically flying through those classes.</sentence><sentence id="288">So that's why I could finish really on time, otherwise it wouldn't have been possible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: I want you to help me get a picture, and actual, so I can make a little movie</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="296">and describe, what kinds of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, did you walk Edwarda Rorat 14 February 25, 1996 Page 14 when I carry some food with me, I gave it to dogs and they ate it and then I felt safe with them.</sentence><sentence id="297">And in the winter it was deep snow, sometimes up to my shoulders or more, I have to part the snow with my arms.</sentence><sentence id="298">In summer it was not too bad, I walked bare feet and I loved the blue <span class="DLF">sky</span> and lots of poppies, you know the red flowers?</sentence><sentence id="299">They grow there in abundance in <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">And the birds were singing so I think this is my love of nature.</sentence><sentence id="301">Did I describe my walks?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Sounds like a really nice part of your day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: That was after the war of course, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And then you would get to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, what did the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> look like, was it a wooden <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yeah, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, when I walked several miles to this other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, this was already better place than my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">It was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, nothing really special.</sentence><sentence id="316">I particularly like classes of religion.</sentence><sentence id="317">The priest was giving them and he was teaching of all those miracles that happen in Catholic religion.</sentence><sentence id="318">Of course I was educated and brought up actually in Catholic experience, so I was learning this.</sentence><sentence id="319">Of all the miracles that happen in Catholicism and I suppose this was pleasant to me.</sentence><sentence id="320">Maybe I thought that miracles will happen to me too, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="321">And I was reading all the books on the subject.</sentence><sentence id="322">So actually this is my most pleasant thought, the priest.</sentence><sentence id="323">He was not anti-Semitic, at least didn't let me feel it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Did you feel any conflict between, being brought up as a Jew that you were not to</sentence><sentence id="336">Edwarda Rorat 15 February 25, 1996 Page 15 worship idols in Catholicism with it's love of idols?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: A conflict within myself?</sentence><sentence id="341">No, I was very curious to learn this Catholic religion, it was very soothing to me, I like the miracles and as I told to you, I eliminated the thought of my parents from my mind and I did not remember if my parents were religious or not, I don't remember any of that.</sentence><sentence id="342">So I was trying to learn what I was taught.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Did you pray for a miracle?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: I sort of did, yes, I remember at one time I was such a good girl that it was my way to be loved by these people and I was so much in a hurry to prepare for them the meal when they were returning from working hard in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">I wanted to cook for them and I lost the key and I thought, if I don't find that key, how will I cook for them, that thought was unbearable.</sentence><sentence id="350">I just didn't know what to do, that I behaved in such a way that I win them.</sentence><sentence id="351">I don't know if I prayed for it.</sentence><sentence id="352">I really don't remember praying, don't forget that I was brought up Catholic and then I was educated in my very sensitive years as a Communist, so when I think of it now, it all get little blurred and confused and then I came to this <span class="REGION">Capitalistic country</span> and became a doctor, so altogether nothing goes together really.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: Okay, you're in this <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>, you're praying for a miracle of the finding of the key.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="360">The key gets found, you know there's some validity to this thing.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="362">But I really don't, I must tell you I don't dwell much on my past life.</sentence><sentence id="363">Actually I pretty much avoided talking about myself altogether, so by not talking about it I guess I don't remember how I, did I pray?</sentence><sentence id="364">No, all I wanted, not to be called a dirty, lousy</sentence><sentence id="366">Edwarda Rorat 16 February 25, 1996 Page 16 Jewess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Did that happen?</sentence><sentence id="375">Did people stop calling you that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: Well, I was moving on to better <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, then eventually went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, so no, yeah, they did stop calling me openly that, that changed, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: How many people lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that you were in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: Even that hard for me to tell now, maybe 50?</sentence><sentence id="383">It was a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they had their children and so on, but it was very tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: So were they individual <span class="DLF">farms</span> that were spread out or?</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1564">A: Well you know, I had the selection of choosing, right, the people who found me attractive, I could select.</sentence><sentence id="1565">No, about my being Jewish, still had mixed feelings about that, I did not find Jewish men attractive.</sentence><sentence id="1566">Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1567">So that made it easy not to socialize with them, right?</sentence><sentence id="1568">And I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1569">Then I did, eventually I did and then sort of like coming around again I socialize more with European background.</sentence><sentence id="1570">I find that I know more what I'm dealing with.</sentence><sentence id="1571">If they tell me something I can see if they mean it, if they don't, I had very hard time with American hypocrisy, I come from different culture.</sentence><sentence id="1572">There, if people like you they tell you, if they didn't like you they didn't say they do.</sentence><sentence id="1573">They never say I like to see you if they didn't mean it.</sentence><sentence id="1574">So here I come to the socializing and the people say oh it was great meeting you and I like to see you again, I was taking this exactly as that, I waited for them to call, they never did and all these disappointments, I couldn't understand the hypocrisy, I found it very difficult, so that's what I call my American period.</sentence><sentence id="1575">I would say it was super, I found it superficial, the link with the American people.</sentence><sentence id="1576">So I think now, if I think of my closest friends, they are European and some are Jews with similar background as I have, I find that wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1577">Actually my last relationship was with a Jewish man, who also had the, well, had some background during the war but his both parents lived and he really didn't have much hardship except he understood what it means to be a Jew and confronted with anti-Semitism and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1578">I find that this was so great for me, something in common.</sentence><sentence id="1579">But that ended, as all my other relationship.</sentence><sentence id="1580">Actually he ended it, I was very surprised.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1583">Edwarda Rorat 66 February 25, 1996 Page

general.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1585">A: Yeah, with women, yeah I had some women friends, don't forget that I left my friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the friends that, I mean I think the most serious friends are the one who date from your young years, from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, growing up, right, when you have time to prove yourself?My old friends were left behind, I have to have new friends in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1586">So some women, some women I think are jealous of me or something, I was afraid of them maybe, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1587">I'm okay now with friends with women, but it's the same like with men.</sentence><sentence id="1588">If I like women very much, if this is close relationship, I start being possessive also the way I am for men.</sentence><sentence id="1589">I think it's again the fear that they leave me.</sentence><sentence id="1590">Is thats a ridiculous thing, I cannot change it.</sentence><sentence id="1591">So at this point, I don't want to be that close to anybody, because then I cling.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1600">Q: Do you think of yourself now as Jewish or as Catholic or as what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Jewish because I, you know, I had to take sides, political situation here and also taking holiday in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I mean somebody has to cover Catholic days and somebody has to cover Jewish, so I took the Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1603">I take Jewish holidays, even it doesn't feel to me like a holiday at all, but at least I present it to the world that I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1604">So the holidays don't touch me, but I take it just to show the front that I'm Jewish and I don't work on Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And also I think politically I am pro-<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, is something in me that I have no question about it, I am pro-Israel and I was very proud when they win the war in "67.</sentence><sentence id="1606">I find it so amazing that suddenly they were best soldier, best army and this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is so strong and</sentence><sentence id="1608">Edwarda Rorat 67 February 25, 1996 Page 67 the whole world admires them.</sentence><sentence id="1609">I find it's just like I woke up from the <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, since I was indoctrinated that Jews are cowards, as you know, there's no way they could fight, so many jokes about it.</sentence><sentence id="1610">That they're cowards, they don't know anything and I mean, it's endless and suddenly this was, I felt so proud going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and seeing that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1674">A: I'm attracted to this Buddhism or I don't really know the religion but I notice the acceptance of everybody, I mean in this retreat that the guru was conducting, it's believing in yourself more, not in any god that I always had hard time to imagine where is her, where was he with all that suffering was happening?</sentence><sentence id="1675">I couldn't believe it at that time, where was God?As a child I felt that, I really did feel cheated that he's not protecting me.</sentence><sentence id="1676">So in this retreat, it's more like believing in yourself and loving human being, trusting yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1677">I mean, it's the same wisdom, not hurting anyone right, not hurting yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1678">It's looking for spiritual peace,</sentence><sentence id="1680">Edwarda Rorat 69 February 25, 1996 Page 69 not expecting anything after you die.</sentence><sentence id="1681">I find it that it was the best religion during the Christmas they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span> and they have Hanukkah candles and any other religion that you want to observe.</sentence><sentence id="1682">But this is for my recreation, during the daily life I don't have time for any religion.</sentence><sentence id="1683">It seems my religion is the work I guess, I'm totally absorbed in it.</sentence><sentence id="1684">This gave me, I think, it's satisfying that I'm okay.</sentence><sentence id="1685">That <span class="NPIP">part</span> is satisfying.</sentence></p></dialogue>
