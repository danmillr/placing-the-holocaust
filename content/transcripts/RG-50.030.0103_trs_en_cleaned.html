<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Would you please state your name and your <span class="NPIP">birth place</span> for us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Henry Kellerman.</sentence><sentence id="4">I'm a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berliner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">I'ma no longer a German.</sentence><sentence id="6">I gave up my German citizenship when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but I'll always be a Berliner.</sentence><sentence id="7">You can't shake that.</sentence><sentence id="8">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in 1910 under the great reign of Casmir Wilhelm, II.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="9">We were a middle class family, and we went to all the stages and points of interest of a upper middle class family.</sentence><sentence id="10">My father was a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, which put us in the category of, I suppose, really local intellegents here.</sentence><sentence id="11">My mother came from <span class="COUNTRY">Australi</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: My father was a Bavarian.</sentence><sentence id="13">So, if we ever wanted to talk about a mixed marriage, that will be it.</sentence><sentence id="14">My father was far more a philosopher than a theologian.</sentence><sentence id="15">He was a student and became a collaborator of Herman Korne, and was a member of the so called <span class="BUILDING">Marbrook School</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">He wrote extensively a number of books.</sentence><sentence id="17">The last one he couldn't finish because he died prematurely at the age of 53 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">We were in those days a typically Russian middle class family with all the necessary qualifications.</sentence><sentence id="19">We were brought up in the German classics.</sentence><sentence id="20">I remember my mother at the age of 86 could still quote , and all that she learned in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">My father was totally devoted to German philosophy and on one the side and to the Jewish prophets on the other.</sentence><sentence id="22">His sermons I remember were always on a fairly high intellectual level, and as a child I understood very little of it and later I wondered how many else really grasped the meaning of the message he had to give.</sentence><sentence id="23">He had enormous power of intellect and overwhelming.</sentence><sentence id="24">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, where we were educated according to the very strict rules of German humanism.</sentence><sentence id="25">We learned enormously facts and figures.</sentence><sentence id="26">We learned five languages, starting of course with German, French, English, Greek, Latin.</sentence><sentence id="27">You name it, and naturally integral and French calculus.</sentence><sentence id="28">It was a very profound type of education, but it taught us very little about social values.</sentence><sentence id="29">Social criticism particularly in history was not permissible and we grew up without any defense-- intellectual defense at the time against the powers that were to take over later on in the 30s.</sentence><sentence id="30">I went for twelve years to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and graduated in 1928.</sentence><sentence id="31">I then went to various <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fribrook</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, and eventually made my doctorate degree at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span>, doctorate of Juris Prudence.</sentence><sentence id="32">The years I spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, as a child and as an adolescent were years which really laid the foundation for whatever later on became my professional calling.</sentence><sentence id="33">They were great years in many respects.</sentence><sentence id="34">The 20s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, an unforgettable experience.</sentence><sentence id="35">I remember that the summary referred to that the 20s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> as a so called age of pericles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">What was offered in terms of art, culture, and literature was unbelievable, and the names I got to know in this days on the German stage and the German consulates, unforgettable, and I didn't forget them.</sentence><sentence id="37">Later on, I was fortunate enough to meet some of these prominent actors and when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="38">I believe that this is something that is frequently overlooked, that in the 20s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> really seemed to be the cultural capital of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="39">With four operas, 36 legitimate stages, two great symphony orchestras, a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> with high standards of excellence, and with a scientific community which</sentence><sentence id="41">included Albert Einstein among others.</sentence><sentence id="42">It was paramount to nothing.</sentence><sentence id="43">What came afterwards in the 30s was a total collapse of all what we had seen, heard and learned in the 20s.</sentence><sentence id="44">I lived four years under Hitler, and I experienced on the first of April, 1933, the day, I lived continued to stay.</sentence><sentence id="45">I continued to stay for a number of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="46">First of all I wasn't finished with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">It was my hope, which proved to be a total illusion, as it was with many other Germans and Jews, that that was a passing phase, and if we had the patience and the will to stay, we would see the end of the Hitler regime.</sentence><sentence id="48">That proved to be totally untrue.</sentence><sentence id="49">My second reason was that I had always been a member of the Jewish Youth Movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I had been in a leading position there, and when Hitler came and all the young people were thrown out of their German Youth Organizations --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Which German Youth Organizations were you a member of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I will come to that in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="94">We all banded together in one large organization which was called at the time the League of German Jewish Youth, and I became the National head of this organization.</sentence><sentence id="95">By our standards, which were not too large, but there was 10,000 plus with local chapters all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which I visited.</sentence><sentence id="96">We operated under increasing restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="97">There were prohibitions all along the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">We couldn't meet there, we couldn't meet there.</sentence><sentence id="99">The Gestapo people came to the private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where we had our weekly or monthly sessions, and watched us kids discuss Jewish history and religion and took assiduously notes to the terror of the parents.</sentence><sentence id="100">But we were rather not phased by this.</sentence><sentence id="101">We put up with it.</sentence><sentence id="102">Then the restrictions became more acute and we had to limit our meetings and eventually the league was dissolved by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="103">Before that, we created a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a little more than that, a settlement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silizea</span> (ph) where we were training members of our organization for amunication as farmers, as artisans, in other words, in non intellectual pursuits which we felt at that the time might open a new future for these youngsters.</sentence><sentence id="104">I stayed until 1937 and my third reason for staying was I still working on my doctorate dissertation at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">It became more and more precarious and the question, would I be able to make it to the final exam was very questionable.</sentence><sentence id="106">I had a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Berlin University</span> who went to battle for me.</sentence><sentence id="107">After the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> laws were passed in 1935, he called me in and he said, you know it's very doubtful that you still will be able to pass your exam, but I trust that if there is any passions left in this administration, they may remember that they admitted you before and they will feel legally and duty bound to admit you.</sentence><sentence id="108">And he proved to be right.</sentence><sentence id="109">I was indeed permitted over the protest of the Dean of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and probably some political authorities to take my doctorate exam in 1937 at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span>, and I passed it, and a month later I left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">A few years ago, I remembered that 50 years had passed since my first doctorate examination and it occurred to me that I should find out whether the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> would grant me my so called Golden Doctorate diploma which comes 50 years after.</sentence><sentence id="111">But I was not willing really, to be honored that way by a <span class="BUILDING">University</span> that was still under communist control, and I delayed my application until the war came down.</sentence><sentence id="112">After this, I went to my friend in the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> and I said do you think it's practical for me to request that I be granted my</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="116">golden doctorate diploma, and he said that's a great ide</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: So, the <span class="DLF">road</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, in fact last year here in October, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and was given the so called golden doctorate diploma by the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">I spoke to 600 law students to tell them a little bit what it was like to grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 20s and in the 30s.</sentence><sentence id="119">These kids didn't have a clue.</sentence><sentence id="120">It was all completely new to them.</sentence><sentence id="121">The names I mentioned of the people gave distinctive reputation to German and specifically <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in the 20s.</sentence><sentence id="122">So, now I have my golden doctorate diplom</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: Now, I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after as I said after my doctorate exam and came straight to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">Due largely to the fact that I had met a marvelous man in one of our conferences in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of the World Union for Progressive Judaism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, Montefiore and Lilly Montegue, and his name was Rabbi Lazerum, and he was the rabbi of the Baltimore Hebrew congregation.</sentence><sentence id="125">He would urge me long before to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and finally sent me an affidavit which I needed to gain my entrance into the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I had a fellowship at <span class="BUILDING">John Hopkins University</span> in Political Economics.</sentence><sentence id="127">Then later I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and had a position with the National Refugee Service, where I led a division for social and cultural adjustment, and at the same time studied social work at the New York School of Social Work, and got my diplom</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Then war broke out, and I decided I had to do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="129">I wasn't eligible immediately because I had three dependents and I was a little too old then.</sentence><sentence id="130">So, I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to look for a position with any of the war agencies.</sentence><sentence id="131">I was rather lucky to find a position as analyst with which was called the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service.</sentence><sentence id="132">It was part of the Fellow Communications Committee.</sentence><sentence id="133">What we did was to monitor any rebroadcasts mostly and write analyses and send them on to the war department or State Department or the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span>, where there was need for this kind of information.</sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, it included a lot of hard intelligence which was hard to develop.</sentence><sentence id="135">My immediate tutor, mentor, and boss was Doctor Hanzpier, one of the noted sociologists who was also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, who died recently.</sentence><sentence id="136">From Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service I switched over the OSS, the Office of Strategic Services and became a political analyst there.</sentence><sentence id="137">Then, when was nearing its end, and we began to focus on postwar targets, and the Nuremberg Trial was mentioned, I was given the job by OSS to draft the so called pretrial briefs against the Nazi party, the SS, the SA, the Hitler Youths, and I spent about a year trying to get this material together.</sentence><sentence id="138">It proved that we had an enormous amount of material, and yet some of the most important documents like the one document which stipulated the extermination of European Jews was not among them.</sentence><sentence id="139">We must have had it somewhere, but it was not made available at the time.</sentence><sentence id="140">But we had plenty of material when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">I was sent with a team, a research team, under the leadership of Franz Noriman, one of the other great political analysts who emigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and eventually took over his position of chief of research in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> where we continued to collect and present evidence for use by the prosecution.</sentence><sentence id="142">We were part of the American prosecution in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">It was a fascinating experience and I've talked about it often and have written about it, and it was in retrospect I feel a very important and very useful experience.</sentence><sentence id="144">This has been contested by many people who have attacked the Nuremberg Trials as having been trial of the victors who were vanquished and trials based on expo facto law.</sentence><sentence id="145">I didn't see any of these views.</sentence><sentence id="146">I think the Nuremberg Trial was a monumental effort, first of all to punish some of</sentence><sentence id="148">the main culprits who were sentenced to death or life long prison sentences.</sentence><sentence id="149">It's recorded for the world to see what the Nazi legacy had been, and it created new international law which was promulgated as such later on by the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Can you give us some specific cases that you worked on and some of the people that you worked with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Well, we tried for one thing, Bill Donovan, who was the head of the OSS and my boss, and I worked together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and we tried to break down the testimony of Herman Goering, who was the prima dona of the trial.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was enormously difficult.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="178">Goering was a man of extreme intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="179">We gave him ani.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: test, all the defendants, and Goering and , a former minister of finance and potentially for the war effort emerged in the genius category.</sentence><sentence id="181">There came the day when we presented the structure and the pogrom of the party to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">A young mayor, not so young, a mayor whose name shall not be mentioned, was given the task of presenting the evidence against Goering and the rest.</sentence><sentence id="183">The mayor was a man who had studied the record, but it hadn't sunk in, so I had to coach him for the job, and I presented him with a chart of the party, and he said when you introduce the party tomorrow will you please point out that Goering was the number one deputy of Hitler, and that Hess was number two and then follow up with the rest of hierarchy.</sentence><sentence id="184">He couldn't grasp it.</sentence><sentence id="185">I would say now repeat after me, Goering number one, Hess number two.</sentence><sentence id="186">And he would say all right, if the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> please the head deputy was Mr. Hess and Goering was number two.</sentence><sentence id="187">It went on and on.</sentence><sentence id="188">He couldn't get it straight until at midnight I thought he had it right.</sentence><sentence id="189">So, the next morning we assembled in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> and the mayor stepped forward and said, if the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> please, I will introduce now the charter, and as shown on this chart here of the party, we said number one deputy was Mr. Hess, number two was Goering.</sentence><sentence id="190">You should have seen Goering.</sentence><sentence id="191">He got light in the face.</sentence><sentence id="192">He shook his hand.</sentence><sentence id="193">He waived pieces of paper and I said we have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="194">I sent a piece of paper up to the good mayor and said Major would you please correct yourself and ask the person on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> to listen to you, you made a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="195">He stopped and looked down and he said oh, if the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> will permit me, number one deputy was Goering.</sentence><sentence id="196">You should have seen Goering.</sentence><sentence id="197">He was pleased as pie, and that was only a few weeks before he committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="198">But if he went down, he went down with flying colors.</sentence><sentence id="199">Another thing which I remember which was important I think.</sentence><sentence id="200">At one point, when we showed the film, the <span class="BUILDING">death mills</span>, which is documentary we found showing some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and showing some of the scenes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, we darkened the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> and had only lights shining on the faces of the 22 defendants.</sentence><sentence id="201">And I had opportunity to study the faces while that film was shown and all that brutality and it was amazing how they fell apart.</sentence><sentence id="202">Goering never looked at it.</sentence><sentence id="203">Neither did Hess.</sentence><sentence id="204">Schott who maintained all through the trial that he had nothing to do with the atrocities, turned his back to the screen and crossed his arms in front of him to indicate that he had been an absentee during the Nazi period.</sentence><sentence id="205">Franz, the butcher of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> broke into tears.</sentence><sentence id="206">So, did Salkin, who was the labor czar.</sentence><sentence id="207">The only person who looked at the screen with obvious glee and pleasure was Streicher who was the so called gall leader in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, Franconia, and who had been the editor and publisher of this filthy</sentence><sentence id="209">rag the Stormer, Storm Trooper you might call it.</sentence><sentence id="210">This was his show.</sentence><sentence id="211">He felt that he was vindicated completely by that picture.</sentence><sentence id="212">He also was the one, he was sentenced to death who allegedly, I wasn't there, shortly before his execution said to the executioner now you have your poem after all.</sentence><sentence id="213">He knew his Jewish calendar obviously.</sentence><sentence id="214">Now, those are scenes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">I do remember many others that may be worth quoting, but the trial itself was conducted by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> which was divided in four parts, two American judges, two Soviet judges, two French judges and two Russian judges.</sentence><sentence id="216">They were not in agreement all of the time.</sentence><sentence id="217">That was obvious, but still the proceedings were conducted with utter dignity and decorum and I'll never forget the opening statement of the presiding judge, Judge Lawrence from <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> that this was a trial to be conducted without fear or favor.</sentence><sentence id="218">And it was.</sentence><sentence id="219">We had a galaxy of lawyers, SS prosecutors, as well as defendants and judges of course.</sentence><sentence id="220">The judgment was to many disappointing although some of them the guilty one including the military, top military were sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="221">I carried away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> the conviction that I had attended an event that would go down in history as one of the probably most remarkable demonstrations of international justice, and I still feel that same way about it.</sentence><sentence id="222">Although I will admit that the major purposes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to protect peace and to ban genocide and anti-semitism have not yet been met and probably will not for some time to come.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Can we digress for a second and go back to your role as to exactly you did for preparation of this trial and who you interacted with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Well, I interrogated quite a few of the defendants and also as I mentioned before wrote these pretrial briefs in which I packed all the evidence we had at the time on the felonies of the party leaders, the so called leadership core, the SS, the SA also many of these things came to light after the trial including the one document as I mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="271">I was chief of research.</sentence><sentence id="272">That was my title in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">I had a staff of a dozen people, most of them members of the Office of Strategic Services, including such upstanding lawyers as John Herz, who was part of it, and was a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, later.</sentence><sentence id="274">And we just collected the evidence and some of the evidence that came to us in the most peculiar ways I remember that one day a reporter from the New York times, came in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and said I understand you're responsible here for collection of evidence.</sentence><sentence id="275">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">I went to the Chancellory, Hitler's Chancellory which was a heap of rubble of course in those days.</sentence><sentence id="277">I looked around and there were a lot of papers and I picked some up.</sentence><sentence id="278">I don't read German.</sentence><sentence id="279">I have no idea what I picked up.</sentence><sentence id="280">I'd like you to take a look at it, and he handed me a piece of paper that was slightly torn and singed of course, but low and behold there was the order from the SA party judge for the so called crystal night to the S</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: You know it was long denied that that was any organized effort.</sentence><sentence id="282">It was always as the used to call it, the boiling soul of the people who did it, but far from it.</sentence><sentence id="283">There was the order, black and white for the SA to get busy and set the torch in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> of Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Can you tell us whose interviews you participated in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Well, one I remember quite distinctly was who was the head of the <span class="DLF">labor farm</span> and he was a sad sap by the time they got to him, he was obviously ill.</sentence><sentence id="293">His eyes were tearing, his nose was flooding liberally, and I presented him with the chart of the party and said now you were the leader of the organization, tell me whether this is correct the way we put it together, and Lyle looked at it and he said well yes it is correct.</sentence><sentence id="294">It is correct, but that doesn't in any way reflect the reality.</sentence><sentence id="295">This was a dynamic organization and you cannot put it into boxes straight lines and <span class="DLF">vertical lines</span> and what not.</sentence><sentence id="296">He then began to take my fountain pen to draw weird circles within circles and said this is the dynamism, unless you catch it you can't catch us.</sentence><sentence id="297">Two days later he was dead.</sentence><sentence id="298">He obviously had committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="299">That was one example.</sentence><sentence id="300">Then there was a real red neck I got this SS leader from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>, a fellow by the name of , and I confronted him with some of the atrocities that were committed by the SS in <span class="REGION">southern Russia</span> and he looked at it and looked at it and said I don't understand how can you people know these things, you must have a terrific staff.</sentence><sentence id="301">I don't know whether he tried to find out in order to get a favorable consideration or not, but he was one of the worst butchers.</sentence><sentence id="302">And then the other one, I will remember and never forget was a fellow by the name of .</sentence><sentence id="303">He was -- he referred to himself as the butcher of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

it.</sentence><sentence id="310">I have never known, but I don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="311">went to the collapse, and I have it black and white.</sentence><sentence id="312">It's in the archives, and said in German ; have we tried in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and knew it.</sentence><sentence id="313">I don't think the children in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> knew much was going on in the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> although they may have heard rumors to the effect, but was sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">He didn't stay very long.</sentence><sentence id="315">He was liberated, was put back again, and died eventually.</sentence><sentence id="316">So, those are some of the vignettes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">There were many more.</sentence><sentence id="318">I could go on forever telling you stories.</sentence><sentence id="319">I would like to perhaps finish by saying this.</sentence><sentence id="320">The punishment of the guilty was of course one of the post war targets and I had the satisfaction of being part of that, but I always felt that this was not enough.</sentence><sentence id="321">I remembered the days of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimer</span>, where a fledgling democracy was trying to come to the fore, and found very little sympathy outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">The unbelievable reparation which were astronomical and which were never paid as a result of it, prevented not only the flourishing of the democracy but increased of course the strengths of the reactionary forces which eventually gave birth to the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="323">The Weimer republic not a very experienced democracy and not very strong, collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="324">And my feeling, the feeling of some of our friends was that this must not happen a second time, and that after World War II as against World War I we would have a duty to encourage and force the democratic elements in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if anyone could be found.</sentence><sentence id="325">They could be found.</sentence><sentence id="326">We found people like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Audenaur</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">We found people like the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, , and many, many others whom I got to meet after the war.</sentence><sentence id="328">And we decided that in order to help them, we not only had to sanitize <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> economically, it</sentence></p><p><sentence id="331">was the Marshall plan, but we had to do something also for the education of the new generation.</sentence><sentence id="332">And out of this came the so-called re-education program, which was at the time was a multi million dollar program.</sentence><sentence id="333">Today you would have to put the equivalent of billions for the kind of help that we had at our disposal.</sentence><sentence id="334">I was appointed in the State Department, Director of this program.</sentence><sentence id="335">We decided that one of the most important things to do was to get some of the young Germans, students, teachers, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students even to come over to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and have them stay here for a while to get to know what democracy looked like seeing not only from the federal but from the <span class="REGION">local level</span>, and we recreated a so-called leadership program where practically all the leading members in politics, in the law, in the professions were invited to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, including future presidents and chancellors of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">And in order to give them a chance to observe what they found here and if possible to apply it on their return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">This was a program, I remember sitting here one night, at <span class="DLF">Pennsylvania Avenue</span>, in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and decided what this program should be like.</sentence><sentence id="338">The total exchange program of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in those days was a few hundred and we are mostly Chinese students for some reason, I don't remember what it was.</sentence><sentence id="339">I said now we have to do much more here.</sentence><sentence id="340">I turned to the staff and I said we've never done it before, what would you think of a figure of 2,000.</sentence><sentence id="341">And of all people, my budget man spoke up and said 2,000, why not 3,000?</sentence><sentence id="342">Why not 3,500?</sentence><sentence id="343">I said do you think we can do it?</sentence><sentence id="344">He said I have no ide</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: We should try, and we did.</sentence><sentence id="346">We did within a short span of years about 13,000 people involved in this exchange program.</sentence><sentence id="347">Most of them came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and experts and teachers and political advisors went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">Then later we extended it to other <span class="REGION">European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">We paid for it, and it's still going, although most of it today is on a private basis.</sentence><sentence id="350">But this exchange program really must be given for quite a bit of credit for what really happened in terms of political reform in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the federal, state and local level.</sentence><sentence id="351">That is the sort of thing we failed to do in the 20s.</sentence><sentence id="352">And I felt very strongly, well I wasn't the only one, this mistake had to be corrected after World War IL.</sentence><sentence id="353">It must not be permitted again.</sentence><sentence id="354">And we found people like -- well not General Clay.</sentence><sentence id="355">General Clay in the beginning had doubts.</sentence><sentence id="356">General Clay felt that he had so much money available and that had to be spent for economic purposes.</sentence><sentence id="357">He kept saying you cannot teach democracy on an empty stomach.</sentence><sentence id="358">We had to agree with him, but no need to do one thing without the other.</sentence><sentence id="359">Well, he had concerns that German students coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> would be exposed to a lot of unpleasant personal experiences.</sentence><sentence id="360">It turned out to be totally wrong.</sentence><sentence id="361">We hardly ever had a single unpleasant experience among all these thousands of people who came over here, and we have proved to show it.</sentence><sentence id="362">These returning exchanges were responsible for a number of very important reforms in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">For instance, a group of parliamentary deputies, German , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and they said we have a terrible time because we are having what they call the chancellor democracy.</sentence><sentence id="364">The chancellor can legislate whatever he wants to and we really have no resources in any form or fashion to compete with it.</sentence><sentence id="365">We need to.</sentence><sentence id="366">So, we sent him to what then was a legislative Library of Congress.</sentence><sentence id="367">Legislative Reference Service of Congress and he came back he said that's just what we have to have.</sentence><sentence id="368">A staff organization where we can prepare our own legislation and where we don't have to take everything that the administration sends to us on our <span class="DLF">hill</span> and they created it.</sentence><sentence id="369">And they created as a result of it a balance</sentence><sentence id="371">between the German chancellorship and the German parliament.</sentence><sentence id="372">That was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="373">Another thing is they were preparing a new law for the military and we invited the whole committee which was preparing this law to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to make it show two things.</sentence><sentence id="374">First of all, the problem of civilian control over the military and how we protected the rights of the individual soldier against any intervention from the top.</sentence><sentence id="375">They came.</sentence><sentence id="376">We took them all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">We opened the resources for him.</sentence><sentence id="378">We went back and made a very good law which is still in existence so those were some of the things that we tried to do with our so called re-education program.</sentence><sentence id="379">Incidentally let me say I never liked much the term re-education.</sentence><sentence id="380">It was really more to soften the American taxpayer than to appease the Germans and we later renamed it re-orientation which was not only appreciated but highly praised program and the German Parliament passed a resolution thanking us for what we did there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: Can I ask you your comparison between the trial that you participated in and the subsequent trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Well, the subsequent trials really fell apart.</sentence><sentence id="422">If you want to see the documents as I read Telford Taylor's book and I was invited to go back as deputy to Telford Taylor for the second trial and I didn't do so.</sentence><sentence id="423">I was so advised in fact by my old boss Bill Donovan of , and it turned out that some of the trials were good and some of it is documented among other things in this marvelous picture I've seen three or four times, Judgment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, with Spencer Tracy and Lancaster which more or less gave you the flavor and philosophy of what really was I suppose the purpose of these trials.</sentence><sentence id="424">But in many cases they just collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="425">In some cases, the Germans proved to be tougher than we.</sentence><sentence id="426">For instance, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> acquitted Schott, which I thought was a major mistake at the time, but the Germans put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="427">So, there were some trials that worked out right, but on the whole what came afterwards ended very often in acquittals and in minor penalties and never reached the level of the ,</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Well, the American prosecution, which I thought was a very good one, was headed by Justice Jackson.</sentence><sentence id="439">He was the chief prosecutor and he made a magnificent opening statement at the time.</sentence><sentence id="440">His deputy was General William Donovan.</sentence><sentence id="441">Old Bill Donovan of the fighting 69s of World War I, and then the rest of the group was composed of lawyers from the <span class="BUILDING">Judge Advocate Office</span> of members of the OSS like myself, of Navy officers, Army officers, most of them with the exceptions of the OSS members, were in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="442">I wore a uniform but more for ornamental purposes.</sentence><sentence id="443">I was what they called a major at the time, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="444">But they were a <span class="BUILDING">military tribunal</span> after all.</sentence><sentence id="445">You saw the defense of course was not in uniform and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> wasn't except I believe the Russian judges were in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="446">Not the Americans, and not the French, certainly not the British.</sentence></p></dialogue>
