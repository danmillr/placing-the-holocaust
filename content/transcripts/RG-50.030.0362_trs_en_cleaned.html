<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Tell us about your parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My parents had a checkered career.</sentence><sentence id="12">They were both immigrants, they arrived from different communities in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in approximately 1907.</sentence><sentence id="13">My father was married at the time he arrived.</sentence><sentence id="14">And he and my mother met and they fell in love.</sentence><sentence id="15">And eventually they were married.</sentence><sentence id="16">But a lot of sturm und drang!</sentence><sentence id="17">over many years.</sentence><sentence id="18">And so I, I, I was born in 1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What do you know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where your parents came from and why did they want to come here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age.</sentence><sentence id="30">His mother died when he was very young.</sentence><sentence id="31">I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A Century of Time."</sentence><sentence id="32">And his father remarried a woman who had two small children.</sentence><sentence id="33">My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen area</span>, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children.</sentence><sentence id="34">He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in the winter and putting it under his coat and running to the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese.</sentence><sentence id="35">So it was that kind of poverty.</sentence><sentence id="36">He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century.</sentence><sentence id="37">And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, owning a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> of his own, hiding inside the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> arms of the anarchist movement -- and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905.</sentence><sentence id="38">Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, leaving behind a wife and one or two children.</sentence><sentence id="39">My mother came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but " storm and stress (German); "life's hard knocks," hassles.</sentence><sentence id="42">there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of.</sentence><sentence id="43">I picked this up at the Museum of the Diaspora in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">The population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> declined by half -- 25, 3,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="45">And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65.</sentence><sentence id="47">And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers.</sentence><sentence id="48">And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for their stay, being taken care of in their old age.</sentence><sentence id="49">And the son-in-law, husband of sis-- my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15.</sentence><sentence id="50">So she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">So, it's a story of great poverty, the background.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Can you tell us both of their names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: What?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Can you tell us both of their names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="83">A Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the family name.</sentence><sentence id="84">And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out the grandparent's names.</sentence><sentence id="85">Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died.</sentence><sentence id="86">His father's name was Israel Feivel.</sentence><sentence id="87">My mother's father's name was, I had it and I lost it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: You'll remember it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: And the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: My mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ivye</span> and my father came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drozgenik</span> which was a sort of a small <span class="DLF">spa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drozgenik</span> in the encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to trace through Lithuanian sources.</sentence><sentence id="102">Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: What did your parents do here?</sentence><sentence id="108">When you were little, how did they make a living?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Well, my father became a baker.</sentence><sentence id="115">My mother became a dressmaker.</sentence><sentence id="116">They happened to meet in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">tenement apartment</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">My father's older brother lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother's, but older than my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little baby at the time.</sentence><sentence id="118">And to keep things going they had boarders.</sentence><sentence id="119">So, there was a group of male boarders in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where my father stayed.</sentence><sentence id="120">And my mother stayed with two or three female boarders in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">And that's how they met and shacked up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think.</sentence><sentence id="133">They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it.</sentence><sentence id="134">Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way.</sentence><sentence id="135">And -- but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, we grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">secular household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar mitzvahed.</sentence><sentence id="137">We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle schools.</sentence><sentence id="138">And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward?</sentence><sentence id="139">and reads that.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I went through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, and even into their sem- the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> for several years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Tell us what that is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Well, the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: No, I mean the Workman's Circle.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist movement, the Bund".</sentence><sentence id="157">And so, in, particularly at the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars.</sentence><sentence id="158">It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers.</sentence><sentence id="159">Mendele,* Peretz,deg Sholom Aleichem, Ash", poets, but not taught Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="160">And it was an anti- Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists.</sentence><sentence id="161">Anti- stateism, stateists.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I -- when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign.</sentence><sentence id="163">After the war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about 2 Jewish Daily Forward 3 Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lita</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poylen</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Rusland</span> [Universal Jewish Worker's Union in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization.</sentence><sentence id="164">4 Mocher Seforim Mendele 5 Isaac Leib Peretz (r) Sholem Ash</sentence><sentence id="166">it.</sentence><sentence id="167">And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war.</sentence><sentence id="168">And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again.</sentence><sentence id="169">Because I felt I had been misguided, politically.</sentence><sentence id="170">And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky", who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you.</sentence><sentence id="172">And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion(r) and Labor and Mapai?</sentence><sentence id="173">and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism -- Zionist Poison."</sentence><sentence id="175">So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: What, in what way had they misguided you?</sentence><sentence id="204">What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education.</sentence><sentence id="208">They were anti-stateist.</sentence><sentence id="209">They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl!deg and Weizman!"!</sentence><sentence id="210">and that group also.</sentence><sentence id="211">So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">They were the ones who were organizing the <span class="DLF">underground routes</span> to bring them to <span class="DLF">European ports</span> and transferring them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and sneaking them into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was not open, the anti-- there were no anti-- there were no refugee immigration laws at the time.</sentence><sentence id="214">So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.</sentence><sentence id="215">7 Vladimir Jabotinsky 8 David Ben Gurion deg Mifleget Po'alei Eretz Israel; Israeli labor party founded 193 0. "(</sentence><sentence id="216">c) Theodor Herzl " Chaim Weizman</sentence><sentence id="218">I could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated.</sentence><sentence id="219">And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="240">How did you go into it?</sentence><sentence id="241">Where did you go at first?</sentence><sentence id="242">What did you see and how did that affect you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="244">There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two.</sentence><sentence id="245">But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in.</sentence><sentence id="246">And I remember us going to a <span class="BUILDING">naval recruiting station</span>, oh like 1943, let's say.</sentence><sentence id="247">And the fellow across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight?"</sentence><sentence id="248">And we're; "uh, huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing ship tanks</span>, you know, to run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">And we leave the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and one of us says to the other, "You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better."</sentence><sentence id="250">So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="251">I arrived at the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">What?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: The year?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: 1944, then, September.</sentence><sentence id="266">And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder -- Hiirtgen Forest.</sentence><sentence id="267">And overnight the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hiirtgen Forest</span> had some very special qualities; it was a tall <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you.</sentence><sentence id="268">And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded.</sentence><sentence id="269">So, that was my initiation into combat.</sentence><sentence id="270">But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And I was with the ninth Infantry Division.</sentence><sentence id="272">Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the <span class="REGION">area</span> in which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> I went later, was in.</sentence><sentence id="273">My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries.</sentence><sentence id="274">And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways.</sentence><sentence id="275">Anyway, so I was in battle for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which is closest to the <span class="DLF">French border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">I crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr River</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diiren</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">I was in the Battle of the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="278">We then moved into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> when that was over.</sentence><sentence id="279">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Godesburg</span> which is just south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> to many governmental, <span class="BUILDING">German governmental offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the <span class="DLF">Remagen bridge</span> and they have sent people over it and we are put onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the <span class="REGION">site</span> and we're crossing the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> under direct fire from the</sentence><sentence id="283">other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">Like the Palisades in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, crossing George Washington, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">And we establish a beach head on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, was in the public relations unit of the division that took the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> originally.</sentence><sentence id="287">And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces.</sentence><sentence id="288">By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders.</sentence><sentence id="289">In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American divisions, moving through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, bypassing the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span>, came to the <span class="DLF">heights</span> there above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, they look out and they see the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> is still standing.</sentence><sentence id="290">It was the only <span class="DLF">bridge</span> still standing.</sentence><sentence id="291">And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley!" ,</sentence><sentence id="292">General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, "Shall -- which battle plan -- shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> standing?"</sentence><sentence id="293">And Ike says, "Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across."</sentence><sentence id="294">Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people.</sentence><sentence id="295">And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, get" -- he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on."</sentence><sentence id="296">And that shortened the war by two or three months.</sentence><sentence id="297">And so -- and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hiirtgen Forest</span> -- basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders.</sentence><sentence id="298">I adored Bradley.</sentence><sentence id="299">I adored Eisenhower.</sentence><sentence id="300">I thought they were the greatest in the world.</sentence><sentence id="301">And, and anyway, I fought all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">We could have moved on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="304">And I, I feel great about having been a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="305">I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded.</sentence><sentence id="306">It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier.</sentence><sentence id="307">I been, you know, battle after battle.</sentence><sentence id="308">I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr Valley</span>, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">That was part of the rotation scheme.</sentence><sentence id="310">Letting different soldiers take a few days from the <span class="DLF">front line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">And I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="312">And I'm walking -- I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story -- I'm walking along the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Champs-Elysees</span>, and word spread that Roosevelt had died.</sentence><sentence id="313">Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he died.</sentence><sentence id="314">And then two days later I was back at the front.</sentence><sentence id="315">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="316">Anyway, then because of my 2 Gen.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="430">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="431">Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word.</sentence><sentence id="432">Which is my inspecting a -- some <span class="BUILDING">hospital facility</span> somewhere in this <span class="REGION">county</span> we were in, which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for Jewish displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="433">I have absolutely no recall about it.</sentence><sentence id="434">If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP's, I would have said "no."</sentence><sentence id="435">Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span> in 1961.</sentence><sentence id="437">It's a subliminal yearning I have.</sentence><sentence id="438">Anyway, so, anyway, that county experience was a very interesting experience.</sentence><sentence id="439">And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of <span class="NPIP">places</span>, so I was called to serve at <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> military government.</sentence><sentence id="440">They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish -- two years of German in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and Yiddish -- I was used as a translator of German documents into English.</sentence><sentence id="441">And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wetzlar</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to supervise the military government printing plant.</sentence><sentence id="442">That was printing military government documents.</sentence><sentence id="443">It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it.</sentence><sentence id="444">And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the <span

learned that he was leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for, the States.</sentence><sentence id="447">He was going into the State Department Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.096561" long="8.215515">Wiesbaden</span> one weekend, which was zone <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and his name is Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow.</sentence><sentence id="448">He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, right after it was formed.</sentence><sentence id="449">A very able fellow.</sentence><sentence id="450">Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span>, when there would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and your interests?"</sentence><sentence id="453">You see, at the <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="454">my, one of my major assignments during the year and a half I was there, you had to do something in exchange for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, it was the <span class="BUILDING">South End House</span>, was the second oldest <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">It had been founded in 19 --1892 or 1893.</sentence><sentence id="456">He had to prepare a 50th annual report.</sentence><sentence id="457">He turned that assignment over to me.</sentence><sentence id="458">I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this and everything.</sentence><sentence id="459">I did the draft of the 50th annual report.</sentence><sentence id="460">This is how he and I became so close.</sentence><sentence id="461">Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed.</sentence><sentence id="462">And then I did other things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement house community</span>, I did a term paper for my master's program on city planning, on the South End planning board.</sentence><sentence id="463">A history of that and what it did.</sentence><sentence id="464">So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests of experience and then the following morning he brought me into <span class="BUILDING">zone headquarters</span> and Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from the <span class="REGION">Eastern Division</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">A marvelous woman, she just died about two years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Barbara</span>.</sentence><sentence id="466">She later became Chief Public Welfare Officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind for me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine woman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP's.</sentence><sentence id="467">She seemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks as her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become the director.</sentence><sentence id="468">Anyway, then--</sentence></p></dialogue>

it's an encounter, a very severe encounter.</sentence><sentence id="1300">We</sentence><sentence id="1302">1 had, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, a Rabbi Halberstam?(r).</sentence><sentence id="1303">He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="1304">He was a, from a <span class="DLF">line</span> of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="1305">I'm gonna, I'll come back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I've been trying to find out his first name.</sentence><sentence id="1307">I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't locate the piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="1308">So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and look up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="1309">And what was his first name.</sentence><sentence id="1310">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1311">So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992 Brooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1312">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1313">And I see Halberstam, it's almost a column long.</sentence><sentence id="1314">And what I see in this listing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstams</span> is how many have attached to their name, "Rabbi."</sentence><sentence id="1315">So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Forty-three percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names.</sentence><sentence id="1317">That's the Halberstam lineage, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1318">I use statistics to illuminate, not lie.</sentence><sentence id="1319">I mean that is such a powerful fact, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1320">So, anyway, we're back.</sentence><sentence id="1321">So, now, he had lost his wife in the Holocaust, and maybe 10 children.</sentence><sentence id="1322">This man had suffered.</sentence><sentence id="1323">Deeply is not an expression for the suffering that must have been inside this man.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And he was in touch with his confreres in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and they raised money.</sentence><sentence id="1325">And they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing, religious articles, books on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that came, arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1326">And the Army would not release the material to Rabbi Halberstam.</sentence><sentence id="1327">And the cables must have flown between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and political pressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally after a week or two, a compromise is reached.</sentence><sentence id="1328">They will release his -- that material to the director of the camp.</sentence><sentence id="1329">So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do I do with that material?</sentence><sentence id="1330">Can I -- considering the pressure I am under from the Army on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam?</sentence><sentence id="1331">So, I am summoned to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1332">He was one of the very few people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of his own.</sentence><sentence id="1333">Somewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1334">And I'm sitting across him, across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big black beard, yarmulke hat, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1335">Black piercing eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1336">And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in my life to that point -- nor for two or three decades later -- and here I am confronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king -- I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And we exchanged perfunctory greetings.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And then in effect he says, "Nu?"</sentence><sentence id="1339">I say, "Nu, what?"</sentence><sentence id="1340">He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him.</sentence><sentence id="1341">I say, "But Rabbi, if the Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you directly.</sentence><sentence id="1342">But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you."</sentence><sentence id="1343">He 26 Jekuthieh Judah Halberstam</sentence><sentence id="1345">2 says, "That's not fair."</sentence><sentence id="1346">I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come for 15 years later, "life is unfair."</sentence><sentence id="1347">I said, "I can't.</sentence><sentence id="1348">It would create so much trouble, I can't tell you."</sentence><sentence id="1349">He says, "It belongs to me."</sentence><sentence id="1350">I say, "I know it belongs to you, but I can't.</sentence><sentence id="1351">I will distribute it among the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1352">You will get a good share of it, but you will not get all of it."</sentence><sentence id="1353">He is so upset.</sentence><sentence id="1354">His eyes are piercing through me.</sentence><sentence id="1355">I finally say to him, "But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered."</sentence><sentence id="1356">He basically, didn't give a damn.</sentence><sentence id="1357">I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before.</sentence><sentence id="1358">Here I am, an all inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with unbridgeable attitudes or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1359">The meeting broke up and I left.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And I knew it wasn't fair.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I knew, to this day, I know it wasn't fair.</sentence><sentence id="1362">The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position.</sentence><sentence id="1363">But, again, Thad to make a decision.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I had to choose.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And, and, I made that choice.</sentence><sentence id="1366">I mean, I don't recall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but it was that incident, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1367">Constantly.</sentence><sentence id="1368">Now, let me just say, not only was the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, this problem.</sentence><sentence id="1369">You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it.</sentence><sentence id="1370">But, the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem.</sentence><sentence id="1371">The British clearly didn't want more Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, trying to get some better understanding of the context.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And, incidentally, you find some very interesting material there on that.</sentence><sentence id="1374">I mean, for example, you come across cables, in late "45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world, asking on a top secret basis, "Is there any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in your -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you are designated to, is there any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1375">And then you see cables coming back -- I don't think I've read all the cables coming back -- but substantially, the answer is "no."</sentence><sentence id="1376">But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department, under pressure from the British with regard to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, want to explore what are the options?</sentence><sentence id="1377">Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the <span class="REGION">Eastern countries</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, relating to the Zionist plot to move people into the U.S. zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">And.</sentence><sentence id="1379">some rabbi whose been to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, meets with the American Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and he's telling him about what he found.</sentence><sentence id="1380">Anyway, you come across all this stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1381">And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy.</sentence><sentence id="1382">I've been exploring this in order to understand what I was in the middle of, you see?</sentence><sentence id="1383">Finally, I don't remember the date now, there's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy, whose the chief political officer at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of military government, he was Ike's?"</sentence><sentence id="1384">chief 27 Dwight D. Eisenhower</sentence><sentence id="1386">3 political officer in <span class="COUNTRY">Tunisia</span>, <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>, and he's basically saying, "You're not dealing basically with a conspiracy.</sentence><sentence id="1387">You're dealing -- what you're dealing with is the fact that the Jews don't want to live in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to their people, their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1388">They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are killings.</sentence><sentence id="1389">They know that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is going Communist, they don't want to live under a Communist government.</sentence><sentence id="1390">It's in this atmosphere -- to get out of this that the Zionists are enabling.</sentence><sentence id="1391">It's not a conspiracy, okay?"</sentence><sentence id="1392">So, that's at the highest level of military government.</sentence><sentence id="1393">You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for the battalion leaders, is the infiltration.</sentence><sentence id="1394">So, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had prior food cards.</sentence><sentence id="1395">We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity cards.</sentence><sentence id="1396">How do you think we feel if, if in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span>, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span>, you're there for social humanitarian purposes.</sentence><sentence id="1397">How do you feel being told you can't give out these cards to people who are infiltrating?</sentence><sentence id="1398">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1399">Now, I should point out--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1516">Q: How do you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1518">A: You feel awful.</sentence><sentence id="1519">And rebellious.</sentence><sentence id="1520">And you're gonna bootleg cards somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And, and, I should tell you this anecdote.</sentence><sentence id="1522">Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at midnight, you can ask -- start asking, "When did I get some sleep?"</sentence><sentence id="1523">I would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, pick up a few cops, maybe this time I've had a staff or two with me, and we would start going into every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and taking a count of who is there -- name, and who is there.</sentence><sentence id="1524">We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1525">The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check.</sentence><sentence id="1526">A thousand or more people from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would suddenly descend on you.</sentence><sentence id="1527">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to see a relative.</sentence><sentence id="1528">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to check on their papers.</sentence><sentence id="1529">They were here because of that, they were -- you don't know which of them are telling the truth and who, and who is lying.</sentence><sentence id="1530">So, some end up with duplicate cards.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1532">You're making difficult decisions, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1548">Q: So, you're trying to control who's in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but what you're saying said, people are coming in, maybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't want them to, or UNRRA doesn't want them to--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1550">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="1551">I'm making two -- I'm really talking about two categories.</sentence><sentence id="1552">I'm talking about the people who are already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and who are, who are exploiting the system by getting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and get a little cash.</sentence><sentence id="1553">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1554">And the other is the fresh arrivals.</sentence><sentence id="1555">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1556">And the Army is against the fresh arrivals.</sentence><sentence id="1557">They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they</sentence><sentence id="1559">4 don't want any more.</sentence><sentence id="1560">Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says -- remember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, so they -- their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's different at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1561">Well, let me just state something else, Katie.</sentence><sentence id="1562">You're too young -- You have to understand that in the 1930s -- I didn't experience the 1920s, I was a child -- but in 1930s and "40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1563">A lot of ordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings.</sentence><sentence id="1564">They're your troops.</sentence><sentence id="1565">It's reflected -- if you ask doctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, "What was it like getting into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in the 1930s?"</sentence><sentence id="1566">You'll hear stories.</sentence><sentence id="1567">My brother -- I spoke to a fellow up on the vineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span>, he graduated as an undergraduate in the "30s, first in his class at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span>, was not admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">Went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> medical school and then sometime in the "50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns -- of medicine at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johns Hopkins</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1569">There was antisemitism, this is the -- people don't speak about it now.</sentence><sentence id="1570">I mean, it wasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various <span class="NPIP">places</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, certainly <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">But, there was lots.</sentence><sentence id="1572">So when you -- when, at the ground floor level they, the infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience.</sentence><sentence id="1573">It upsets the system.</sentence><sentence id="1574">They want discipline -- order, that's all an occupation force understands.</sentence><sentence id="1575">I, I, I, I came across a letter someone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training program in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this.</sentence><sentence id="1576">So, you come into here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash.</sentence><sentence id="1577">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1578">It-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1610">Q: What did you want though?</sentence><sentence id="1611">As you're running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but you're also, you're Jewish, and as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1612">So, what do you want?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: Well, I want more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1617">I mean it's no, no big deal.</sentence><sentence id="1618">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1619">Let me, I want to address this.</sentence><sentence id="1620">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were between 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="1621">Of these, about 65,000 lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and 25,000 lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1622">In June of "46, which is towards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the infiltrees, don't give any -- incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting these things.</sentence><sentence id="1623">The, the UNRRA people in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> were also, we used to get together and organize group protests against some of this -- but, in the middle of June, there's a pogrom in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> -- 40 Jews are killed.</sentence><sentence id="1624">I think in the next year, after I left, another 100,000 came.</sentence><sentence id="1625">These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're talking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Equivalent to one and a half percent.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the, no, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent.</sentence><sentence id="1628">I mean -- the proportion between what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the -- you should want more survivors rather than less.</sentence><sentence id="1629">And the political system worldwide has to adjust to that reality.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people are still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my memos an indication of some officer in some group situation, in a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or something, suddenly arrests a Jew who's</sentence><sentence id="1632">5 there.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining someone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1653">Q: We need to change tapes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1657">6 Tape #5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: Okay, I can't find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it.</sentence><sentence id="1659">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1662">Q: What we were just talking about, obviously, there's frustration in your voice about the situation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year after the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, that had echoes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> -- obviously they were worse.</sentence><sentence id="1663">Could you just talk a little more about that frustration.</sentence><sentence id="1664">What would you have liked to have seen happening that you could not provide?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1668">A: Well, you see, given the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, which did not have individual <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> -- though gradually, people got cookers and things like that -- I would have wanted them to move into the <span class="BUILDING">German market</span> and get fresh food a year after the end, the war's ended.</sentence><sentence id="1669">What are we getting GI issue for?</sentence><sentence id="1670">I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing facilities.</sentence><sentence id="1671">So, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, in the large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, which could be the equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as many as 15 to 20 people living.</sentence><sentence id="1672">Four or five families in double-decker <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1673">Families separating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> -- including some single individuals living in the middle of family -- and people, and so on, and children and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1674">They should have gotten more <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1675">Reduced the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And the food was a problem.</sentence><sentence id="1677">But they, basically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word.</sentence><sentence id="1678">And it's a completely, it was a completely different outlook.</sentence><sentence id="1679">You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI's were fraternizing with German girls and German women -- widespread, extensive.</sentence><sentence id="1680">The German types were more gemiitlich?*</sentence><sentence id="1681">to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern European.</sentence><sentence id="1682">So, during the day you're out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and at night you're with a German Fraulein"".</sentence><sentence id="1683">I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so engaged.</sentence><sentence id="1684">But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running -- when I was in military government, organizing and running that <span class="BUILDING">venereal disease hospital</span>, a couple of officers from some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain woman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And I had to stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he -- turns out he was a really wonderful guy, a lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and say, "We can't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1686">She's got to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1687">But, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal 28 senial (German) 2deg young woman (German)</sentence><sentence id="1689">7 disease because she's one of their girlfriends.</sentence><sentence id="1690">So, this was very extensive.</sentence><sentence id="1691">And, I guess, the way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what do you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don't suffer fools easily or kindly.</sentence><sentence id="1692">I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations.</sentence><sentence id="1693">I know, I have confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as anyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me, and I know them.</sentence><sentence id="1694">And so, when I get this kind of stuff-- as my own confidence builds -- I get more and more indignant.</sentence><sentence id="1695">Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though, I don't think it was too much.</sentence><sentence id="1696">There was one incidence described in the charges against me that I -- that this officer says to me, something that they can't do better on housing for the DP's than they do for the GI's.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And his -- and I did this -- the, the charges in front of a few enlisted men -- and the claim is that I said to him, "Fuck the GI's, I'm only worried about the DP's" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the situation with him.</sentence><sentence id="1698">And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our vicinity when we had that conversation.</sentence><sentence id="1699">And he also agrees that the essence of our conversation was that the GI's are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult and trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have quite appropriate housing for them.</sentence><sentence id="1700">But, here you're dealing with survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who are families, children, wives.</sentence><sentence id="1701">You can't make a comparison between what you do for the GI's and what you do for the DP's.</sentence><sentence id="1702">So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as a charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1742">Q: I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to describe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI's that they essentially sympathized, I think this is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with the people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2629">And they laugh and that breaks the strike.</sentence><sentence id="2630">That was the relationship I had with them.</sentence><sentence id="2631">That was not difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2632">I had, I had confidence in my ability to deal with that.</sentence><sentence id="2633">And they had confidence in me.</sentence><sentence id="2634">I notice in the stuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff who worked -- there were two memos from Becky -- she worked for the Joint, attached to the team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to alert him to what was going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army.</sentence><sentence id="2635">And the second, was talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about 45 Leo Srole</sentence><sentence id="2637">1 retaining me and protecting me.</sentence><sentence id="2638">And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency people and one or two other staff people.</sentence><sentence id="2639">And then they had a large staff meeting the following morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are like 18 signatures on the petition.</sentence><sentence id="2640">So, that was not my difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="2641">My difficulty was this anomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem with those schmucks who have no understanding.</sentence><sentence id="2642">I mean, look, one of these guys comes on an inspection during <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2643">I guess it must have been that guy who came for five days.</sentence><sentence id="2644">And we walk into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2645">Now, the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> is closed for Pesach.</sentence><sentence id="2646">They've been giving

and there's a pile of human defecation on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2648">And he, for him, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary

class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, maybe on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seat</span>, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2650">We go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and behind there against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, there's some defecation.</sentence><sentence id="2651">The stupid guy, how does he think I feel about that?</sentence><sentence id="2652">I understand how he's feeling about it.</sentence><sentence id="2653">But he's not giving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if Il had my way, if I had found it two hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up.</sentence><sentence id="2654">But the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was out of use for two or three days at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2655">So, it happened.</sentence><sentence id="2656">Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it.</sentence><sentence id="2657">You know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in -- I'm working with my Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and I'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2658">The Deputy Mayor calls me up -- I won't give you the whole story -- gives me something, "Take care of this."</sentence><sentence id="2659">It's about <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span>, conditions in the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2660">I've been in the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's office</span> then five to six years, so I know what weight I have, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2661">And I've been heavily involved for two years in dealing with various problems of <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> administration.</sentence><sentence id="2662">I call the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two years, and I say, "Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2663">We go there, I won't detail what we find.</sentence><sentence id="2664">At the end of the evening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span>, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am doing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2665">And he raises his voice, "What the hell are you doing there?</sentence><sentence id="2666">You're not Commissioner of <span class="BUILDING">Hospitals</span>, etc.,</sentence><sentence id="2667">etc."</sentence><sentence id="2668">I just say back to him, "What the hell have you known about this?</sentence><sentence id="2669">Have you acted on it?</sentence><sentence id="2670">I'm acting because of dereliction."</sentence><sentence id="2671">Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and [inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -"All taken care of."</sentence><sentence id="2672">On Wednesday, the <span class="BUILDING">Amsterdam News 60</span> comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2673">Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City Administrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals has resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as Commissioner, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2676">2 So, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, is.</sentence><sentence id="2677">I didn't know it all in 1946 in the camp.</sentence><sentence id="2678">But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me, not that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it.</sentence><sentence id="2679">And that was what was involved here.</sentence><sentence id="2680">Maybe I was too -- whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2681">But they were too -- worse, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2682">And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> there was another riot situation, a march on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and one or two Jews were killed by the soldiers because they wouldn't retreat.</sentence><sentence id="2683">That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not backwards and we knew that.</sentence><sentence id="2684">And we knew that we had to deal with them within the family so they didn't see us with guns.</sentence><sentence id="2685">And they didn't see the Army with guns.</sentence><sentence id="2686">And when they saw the guns, they got hurt.</sentence><sentence id="2687">And I have newspaper clippings on that incident.</sentence><sentence id="2688">So, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter.</sentence><sentence id="2689">Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann, who was LaGuardia's emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> in the "30s.</sentence><sentence id="2690">He must have helped raise money for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaGuardia</span>, later they became very close.</sentence><sentence id="2691">During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special Ambassadorial rank to be stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, and Hirschmann was arranging for the escape of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2692">So, he was, in his own way, an old hand.</sentence><sentence id="2693">And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get rid of General Morgan*deg because of the British influence on the European operation.</sentence><sentence id="2694">And he spent the day with me.</sentence><sentence id="2695">And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get -- put it all out to him.</sentence><sentence id="2696">And in his memo, which is in June, "the Army is out to get Henry Cohen."</sentence><sentence id="2697">He starts out, "Henry Cohen" -- this is something I didn't get until he came across it 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it -- "Henry Cohen, director, who appears to have done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army.</sentence><sentence id="2698">They made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is correct, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the <span class="REGION">welfare side</span> too much, was neglecting the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> for the rehabilitation of the people.</sentence><sentence id="2699">A devastating report has been sent to <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> by General McBride*", Ninth Division Commander, and they have asked for Mr. Cohen's removal.</sentence><sentence id="2700">The staff has protested and the entire community had a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his understanding of the problem.</sentence><sentence id="2701">Not like the U.S. Army.</sentence><sentence id="2702">It was two days after this mass meeting that a riot occurred at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2703">This is a concrete example of the Army bucking the job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of the problem to function".</sentence><sentence id="2704">The people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> chose to go on a complete hunger strike unless Mr. Cohen was retained.</sentence><sentence id="2705">He will probably be removed by the Army."</sentence></p></dialogue>
