<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q:Sure.</sentence><sentence id="32">Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A:I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> in 1914.</sentence><sentence id="36">My parents both came here from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at the age of two and three many, many years ago.</sentence><sentence id="37">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> in <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>: <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q:Which part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A:I was born on the West side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and my family gradually moved to the <span class="REGION">North side</span> so that by the time I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmette</span>, just North of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city of Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span>, which is a nice <span class="BUILDING">state school</span>, it had a regular reputation</sentence><sentence id="46">and was just a sufficient distance away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> so I could get away from the family a little bit, but I could also get back -- by hitchhiking -- back, and get a meal when I needed one.</sentence><sentence id="47">And then I went on from <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> where I got my regular degree, Magna Cum Laude, and then I stayed on for an additional year and got an L.L.M. at the suggestion of Felix Frankfurter(ph).</sentence><sentence id="48">I thereafter went down to the Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and clerked for the person I consider to be one of the better judges, one of the best judges, really, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, Augustus N. Hand, not Learned Hand who was his cousin who was on the same <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, but Gus Hand.</sentence><sentence id="49">I stayed with him for a year and then came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, the thesis was -- my thesis was -- that I was going to get a job, which I did get with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Reorganization Division.</sentence><sentence id="51">The reason for the Reorganization Division being that it was the factor in the SEC which handled litigated cases, corporate reorganization cases, and I wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and practice law with my two older brothers in the field of corporate reorganization, which had been occupying a great deal of their time.</sentence><sentence id="52">I never got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> because I left the SEC [phone rings] should I stop?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q:Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Well, I never got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> because I moved from the SEC to one of the <span class="BUILDING">wartime agencies</span>, the office of Price Administration here which seemed a little more exciting at the time as we were just beginning to get into the war.</sentence><sentence id="68">And then from the office of Price Administration, more by chance than anything else, I moved over to the State Department in March of 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q:Before we go to the State Department, could I ask you about your, is your family Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A:My family is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="74">I was raised in the Reform aspect of the Jewish religion.</sentence><sentence id="75">I took Hebrew lessons which, unfortunately, I've completely forgotten about, and, I'm a reasonably non- conforming Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q:And during the early days of National Socialism, you were in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">Were you actively aware of what was happening, and was it something that was a major part of your view of the world at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, I wasn't tremendously aware of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="90">I was... I read the newspapers all the time and so I knew approximately what was going on, as much as one can gain from the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="91">I still remember being in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> when Mr. Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I remember talking about that with a history professor who curiously, whose name I curiously enough still remember, Mr. Slossun(ph), his name was.</sentence><sentence id="92">A very distinguished professor, a very interesting professor.</sentence><sentence id="93">He said, "Hitler will last a few months, that's all."</sentence><sentence id="94">That was in 1933, when I was still in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and I was aware of what was going on quite clearly.</sentence><sentence id="95">When I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> which was in 1935, I saw a lot of people there and, as a matter of fact, I've, a group of other people and I got together and organized - - with a fellow named Nathan Isaacs(ph), who is a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> -- he came over to my little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that I was sharing with a couple of other characters, and sort of gave us lessons in the Talmud, supposedly every Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="96">It lasted about three Saturdays and that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="97">But, so far as what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was concerned, yes I was aware of it but I wasn't deeply involved in anything particular.</sentence><sentence id="98">I do remember being at a Harvard Law Review dinner one time and talking with one of the professors who was resentful about the fact that longshoremen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had been trying to prevent the unloading of goods from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he thought this was an unwarranted interference by a private organization in the affairs of the United States Government.</sentence><sentence id="99">I disagreed rather strongly with him at the time but didn't take a tremendous amount of act, I did not take an active role, really, in anything going on.</sentence><sentence id="100">I had a little bit to do, not very much, with refugee matters.</sentence><sentence id="101">Partially because one of the people who eventually became my partner, and who was a year or two after me in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>, was very much involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="102">And I probably contributed a little bit to some organizations but I didn't do very much more than that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q:You mentioned that it was sort of by chance that you went to the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="124">Can you describe a little bit more about that chance?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A:Yes, I can.</sentence><sentence id="128">As I said, I've spent a large amount of time in the Reorganization Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission when I first came down here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">And eventually in 1943, in early "43, a friend of mine, Bernard Melser(ph), who's still a Professor of Law, Emeritus, at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>, called me.</sentence><sentence id="130">He was temporarily in the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="131">He was a very bright young man and he was about to go over to Europe, I think he was in on the Nuremberg Trials, but he was in the State Department at the time.</sentence><sentence id="132">And he called me, and he said there was a very interesting thing going on there, and why didn't I come over to the State Department and organize or work on something called the Reorganization Program in the Foreign Funds Control Division of the Department of State.</sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, "Bernie, that has absolutely nothing to do with corporate reorganization under Chapter 10 of the <span class="BUILDING">Bank</span>," -- well, Chapter 10 didn't exist, but 77B did -- "under the Bankruptcy Act at all.</sentence><sentence id="134">It's absolutely different."</sentence><sentence id="135">And he said, "Well, you know that and I know that, but nobody else knows that and you're the only person around who knows something about quote, "reorganization."</sentence><sentence id="136">Reorganization is reorganization is reorganization."</sentence><sentence id="137">So, I thought it was a very interesting kind of thing, and went over to the State Department, and basically I was the fellow who was in charge of the program, which there was one, and trying to run the Germans out of enterprises, primarily in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">The reorganization program there was one which took into account the fact that a large number of business enterprises in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>, in particular, had been founded by German enterprises, Farben!</sentence><sentence id="139">and a variety of others.</sentence><sentence id="140">And the worry was that these enterprises would contribute to the Nazi war effort in at least two ways.</sentence><sentence id="141">One was by contributing of funds to a variety of very evil causes; and the other was by contributing and financing espionage, or sabotage, or "DS Barbers Arges Geena Chemical Cartel.</sentence><sentence id="142">Assets of this <span class="BUILDING">Cartel</span> were cloaked by a <span class="BUILDING">Swiss holding company</span> called "Interhandel" after the war. (</sentence><sentence id="143">Source: Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking.</sentence><sentence id="144"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>: Viking, 1982.)</sentence><sentence id="147">worse.</sentence><sentence id="148">And the idea was, you had to allow the Latin Americans to continue to have the benefits of these organizations, many of which were in the medical and drug, pharmaceutical field.</sentence><sentence id="149">You couldn't just close down the organizations, so you had to continue to have the organizations do what they had been doing: producing drugs.</sentence><sentence id="150">But you wanted to get the German influence out of those, and that was the reorganization aspect: trying to introduce, primarily at that time, American enterprise to come in and take over these enterprises.</sentence><sentence id="151">Certainly during the period of the war, and probably thereafter, because we always had the theory that we didn't want the Germans to come back again in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>, particularly in view of the fact that the National Socialist philosophy was one that was anathema to most of us here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q:Was that reorganization separate from the Safe Haven Program?</sentence><sentence id="182">Or was that part of it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A:The Safe Haven Program developed out of the Reorganization thing, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="186">I was one of the originators of this, so called, Safe Haven Program.</sentence><sentence id="187">But that had the same kind of objective at it that the Reorganization Program did.</sentence><sentence id="188">Reorganization was supposed to: a) take care of the present threat -- try to get the German control away from these enterprises in <span class="REGION">Latin American</span> so they couldn't contribute money; and secondly, the idea was to prevent any recurrence of the German influence in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">That, basically, was the Safe Haven Program, prevention of recurrence of Nazism, and fascism, and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q:But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> was an international effort, not just an American effort, is that, can you describe more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> and its beginnings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A:Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Safe Haven</span> was basically, my recollection is, it was basically an American initiative but we certainly had the British involved in it from the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="198">And it may have been international in the broader sense of the word, because I'm sure, as what resulted, as a fact of the later days, the French got involved very heavily.</sentence><sentence id="199">But basically, at the beginning, the British and the Americans were the only ones who were able to do anything and it was a British-American effort, basically aimed at trying to identify German influence which one could equate with Nazi influence at the time, and to try to get rid of that, not only at the</sentence><sentence id="201">present time, but for, to prevent any recurrence of it.</sentence><sentence id="202">That was basically the Safe Haven Program.</sentence><sentence id="203">What we were trying to do is locate <span class="REGION">areas</span> where the Germans had located money, where Germans were cloaking or having somebody else cloak for them etcetera, etcetera.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q:And, specifically, what did you, what was your role in that effort?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A:Well, I was trying to devise policies with respect, particularly in the beginning, with the Latin Americans to try to persuade the Latin Americans, for example, to control the German enterprises, German owned enterprises in their <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">But, my first trip was down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and my effort down there was to try to persuade the Columbian government to either supervise or actually vest the assets belonging to German controlled enterprises and then to have those administered in accordance with this reorganization program by Allies, by Americans, probably, because the Americans were the only ones really able to do this kind of thing but we would have said the British or the Dutch or anybody else, if there were people like that around as well.</sentence><sentence id="217">But there weren't very many around.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q:So it was actually an effort to try and move American management in to take control of the <span class="BUILDING">corporation</span>, is that...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="223">ArYes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q:...what you were doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A:Yes.</sentence><sentence id="228">Exactly.</sentence><sentence id="229">Because the idea was, you were, as I say, had two objectives.</sentence><sentence id="230">One was a wartime objective, to prevent espionage and sabotage and financing of the German war effort and the second was a post-war effort which was akin with the idea, part of the idea that you didn't want the German, Germans as they were then certainly, to come back in to any kind of political power in other areas of the world.</sentence><sentence id="231">We had some problems here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, as you probably know, with... we also had a lot of problems with the possibility of Germans infiltrating into the enterprises, particularly into the enterprises where they had been prominent in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span>, Columbia, <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, etcetera, in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">That was the part of the world that I was very much involved with.</sentence><sentence id="233">The entire enterprise had some people from, for example, one of my good friends, Kovi(ph) Oliver, who is still</sentence><sentence id="235">around, a very distinguished, now former, ambassador of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Colombia</span> many years after this, was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">A good many of the people who were involved in this when I got into it, were Americans who spoke good Spanish because <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> was one of the areas of our concentration.</sentence><sentence id="237">We would find a lot of the people involved in this were people who had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">El Paso</span>, as Kovi(ph) was, or in some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> who spoke Spanish as well as they did English, or nearly as well.</sentence><sentence id="238">Kovi probably spoke it better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q:And that was 1943 when you went to the State Department...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A:1943 was when I came into it.</sentence><sentence id="256">The effort had been going on for awhile before that.</sentence><sentence id="257">I came into this Division of Foreign Funds Control, which was basically trying to look at the financial transactions of people who might be supporting the Axis, and what we were trying to do was to prevent any financial transactions which would have been of benefit to them.</sentence><sentence id="258">There were a variety of aspects of that.</sentence><sentence id="259">One was to blacklist companies, either in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or elsewhere, primarily elsewhere, because we had direct control over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">But we were trying to blacklist companies, mainly from the neutral <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who were doing business with the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q:Can you mention what some of those <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> are, were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A:They were, we were, we had a blacklist which was maintained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, Columbia, <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, a variety of other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">Basically, wherever we thought, what we could do would be to prevent a financial transaction which would have been beneficial to the... to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="271">We were active in trying to say-- to the enterprises, mainly, or to individuals, but mainly these would be enterprises, individuals acting as enterprises, as well-- we were trying to say to them, "If you do this, you're not going to have any access, whatsoever, to any American facilities.</sentence><sentence id="272">And we will not only prevent you now from dealing with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, selling to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or getting exports from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but we will continue this effort after the war in order to prevent you from rebuilding the thing."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q:Could you mention some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">enterprises</span> that we're dealing with, some of the German enterprises?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A:Well, the, <span class="BUILDING">Sterling Drug</span> was one of the enterprises; IG Farben", of course, is the largest one.</sentence><sentence id="286">There were a whole slew of corporations in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> which had been manufacturing ball bearings for other machine parts and things like that, who were all on the blacklist.</sentence><sentence id="287">My recollection does not go to the individual names very much.</sentence><sentence id="288">We had a few Americans on the blacklist, some American nationals living in <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span>... <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were suspected of dealing with the Germans, and we blacklisted American nationals.</sentence><sentence id="289">That raised some issues here but we did it nonetheless.</sentence><sentence id="290">But, one of the real reasons for the negotiations with the Swiss in 1946 was the fact that the blacklist still existed and there were a number of Swiss corporations which were still on the blacklist and they were obviously desirous of getting them off the blacklist.</sentence><sentence id="291">We were desirous of restoring normal relations, too.</sentence><sentence id="292">But the principal motive for the negotiations on the <span class="REGION">Swiss side</span>, was to eliminate the blacklist.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q:I want to lay as much groundwork for the Swiss negotiations as possible.</sentence><sentence id="302">So we're now at "43, "44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="305">You have come to the State Department and you're sort of gradually becoming part of the Safe Haven Program, is this right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A:Yes, except not gradually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q:Not gradually.</sentence><sentence id="309">It didn't happen gradually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A:No, it didn't happen gradually.</sentence><sentence id="313">I was there in the beginning and was very active in it.</sentence><sentence id="314">Largely because I came to the State Department in 1943 as a very healthy young man with very, very bad eyes.</sentence><sentence id="315">And though I tried to get into the Navy, they threw me out, laughing all the time.</sentence><sentence id="316">And then the Army called me down for the draft twice and they examined me from stem to stern and found I was a very, very healthy specimen until they got to my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="317">Then they couldn't believe how bad they were and I got thrown out again.</sentence><sentence id="318">So I was one of the "9 Butte ierwan TE Racbe had many <span class="BUILDING">holding companies</span>, and/or branches all over the world, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="319">See Nicholas Faith, Safety in Numbers: The Mysterious World of Swiss Banking, pgs.</sentence><sentence id="320">144-160.)</sentence><sentence id="323">very few youngish males around here, at the time, who had had a fairly good education, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and so forth, who was around at the time, who was not going into the Army.</sentence><sentence id="324">Most of the people my age were not married at the time (although I got married just at the same time that I went into the State Department), but if we were married, we didn't have kids, etcetera, so most of my colleagues went into the Army or the Air Force or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="325">And I happened to be around, so I moved up in that absolutely new <span class="REGION">area</span> for State Department work very, very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="326">And basically, I was one of the originators of it, and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q:In, I think it was Bower's(ph) book, about the, The Paper Clip Conspiracy, he quoted you as saying that you, one of the reasons you thought you moved up quickly in the State Department, because there some sort of renewed anti-Semitism backlash, because of senior State Department positions earlier.</sentence><sentence id="347">Can you sort of explain what that scene was like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A:I speculated with Mr. Bower(ph) a little bit about this, I've never been quite sure about it, but I did move up.</sentence><sentence id="351">If you take a look at my record in the State Department, I moved up from the entry level to high in the Civil Services, I could go very, very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="352">And there always was a rumor around that the State Department was rather anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="353">I always thought that there were some people in the old Foreign Service who were, although I had many, many friends in the Foreign Service who had no anti-Semitism whatsoever, and I developed these friendships as time went along.</sentence><sentence id="354">But it seemed to me, at the very beginning, that perhaps one reason that I was promoted as quickly as I was, was because I was what you might call a respectable Jew.</sentence><sentence id="355">I'd been to the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span>, I'd been on the Harvard Law Review, I'd been a clerk for a very distinguished WASP%, a judge up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="356">I knew which fork to pick up at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span>, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="357">And I was reasonably respectable.</sentence><sentence id="358">And it seemed to me that there was some possibility that when people looked around they said, well, here's a fellow, we really want to do something about this anti-Nazi program, here's a guy who happens to know a lot about it and who is very competent and 3 WASP: White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="361">0 who is respectable and, you know, he's the kind of person we would like to push forward.</sentence><sentence id="362">So I did get to be the Chief of the Division in a very, very short period of time and, after that the Deputy Director of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and after that the first Assistant Legal Advisor for Economic Affairs, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="363">Whether this had much to do with my being Jewish or not Jewish, I really don't know except that I had a... I always had a sort of a little bit of a feeling that well, maybe, everybody thought well, this is a, quote, good Jew, unquote.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q:But the anti-Semitism, as you said, was not an issue for you.</sentence><sentence id="381">You didn't experience it directly in the State Department.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A:No, I never experienced it directly in the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="385">The only experience I ever had with really discussing it in any, even remote way, was in connection with Mr. Bower's book, The Paperclip Conspiracy, indicated that I was one of the people in the State Department who was most in favor of pursuing what had been Mr. Roosevelt's policy of keeping well-known, very active Nazis out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, both then and probably forever.</sentence><sentence id="386">And there was a program which was near and dear to the hearts of the United States Army people which was to bring German scientists, particularly rocket scientists, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to help us in our rocket program.</sentence><sentence id="387">The Germans obviously had been well-advanced in the rocket program, way ahead of almost anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="388">And it wasn't Warner Von Brown(ph) and people like that, but they wanted to bring a lot more people in.</sentence><sentence id="389">That raised the question as to how many of these people you should bring into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, contrary to what had been the publicly stated policy, as I recall, of President Roosevelt, that, well, no Nazis, or active Nazis, were not going to get into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="390">I was a little more, a lot more perhaps, aggressive in the saying, we ought to have very, very strict standards of necessity and utility, bringing these people into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> than the Army really wanted to adopt.</sentence><sentence id="391">As far as I could tell, back in those days, the Army officers, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> particularly, would go out and they would find somebody who'd swept the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the rocket establishment.</sentence><sentence id="392">They wanted to bring him to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the grounds that he would contribute to the...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="393">our own effort to develop rocket technology.</sentence><sentence id="394">I had a little discussion about that, I wrote a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="398">1 memorandum about it, as a matter of fact, one time, and I got into a dispute, which is in...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="399">accounted in Mr. Bower's book, with a very good friend of mine named Clare Wilcox(ph), for whom I worked, as a matter of fact, a little bit later, in trade matters.</sentence><sentence id="400">He was a very distinguished economist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> and I'm sure he had not the slightest bit of anti- Semitism in him, not the slightest.</sentence><sentence id="401">But he thought that I was being a little too sensitive about the possibility that if you brought some of these Nazis into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> they would contribute to what was then, to a certain extent, the latent anti-Semitism of certain people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">I'd lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I was clerk for Gus Hand, and back in those days, there was a guy named Fritz Coon(ph) who was around, who was a well-known American Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="403">In any case, Wilcox and I got into a dispute which was reflected in a couple of memos back and forth in which Clare(ph) basically said he was just as anti-Nazi as I was but he didn't think that this was the... it was appropriate, we were trying to keep too many people out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who would be useful, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="404">And I had a little discussion by memorandum with him.</sentence><sentence id="405">The fact that it never really became personal was evidenced by the fact that sometime a little bit later, Clare Wilcox(ph) was the Deputy Chairman of our delegation to the International Trade Organization in 1947-48, and I was the legal advisor to that delegation.</sentence><sentence id="406">I was one of Clare's(ph) principal assistants if you can call it that, at that time.</sentence><sentence id="407">And he and I became very, very good friends.</sentence><sentence id="408">So I don't think that, well, that discussion took place largely, I think, because I had said that there were too many of these Nazis, or people who were likely to be Nazis, who were getting into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under color of necessity and I really wanted to have a very strict standard applied.</sentence><sentence id="409">I still remember, we sent somebody around to Vanovar Bush(ph) maybe we sent Vanovar Bush(ph) around to Mr. Conant(ph).</sentence><sentence id="410">I've forgotten which way it went.</sentence><sentence id="411">One of them was in the government...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="412">Tape #1, Side B</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A:One of them was in the government and one of them was not, as I recall.</sentence><sentence id="414">To explore the question of how many of these scientists really would contribute to our rocket technology if they were brought into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="415">And I do recall that, as we got back, was, well, you</sentence><sentence id="417">2 could bring a few of these people in, not too terribly many of them, and you could get everything you needed out of them in a period of about six months.</sentence><sentence id="418">I'm not sure that that's entirely the case, because I suppose if somebody had developed something that really has been very good at one point, you can probably expect to get more things out of him as he went along, in the future.</sentence><sentence id="419">But, my recollection is that that was the reason for Mr. Bower's book, The Paperclip Conspiracy, basically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="429">Q:Right.</sentence><sentence id="430">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took what's, I understand, has been described as a very tough roll against the neutral countries.</sentence><sentence id="431">Can you describe the attitude, maybe even the position, of the State Department going into the Swiss negotiations in 1946.</sentence><sentence id="432">And I guess I need you to sort of lay the groundwork with the Paris Agreements the year before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="437">A:Well, I'll go back even before the Paris Agreement.</sentence><sentence id="438">The Pottsdam(ph) Agreement, signed, basically, the assets in the neutral countries of German nationals, to the Western Allies with respect to reparation purposes.</sentence><sentence id="439">So that the theory was that we would take, the... we'd get reparations from the Germans, and not only from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself, the <span class="REGION">occupied areas</span>, but also from the areas where Germans had interests in the <span class="REGION">neutral countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="440">And the Paris Agreement decided on how those assets, how all of the reparations to be taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, would be divided up among all of the Western Allies.</sentence><sentence id="441">Because the only people present, the only <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> present at the Pottsdam Agreement, were the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="442">So, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> had to do something about allocating the proceeds, allocating the amounts that would be given to the various Allied countries, whether they happened to be <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="443">The Paris Agreement also worked out a formula -- because even then we were concerned about refugees and the people who were left homeless, the persecutees and so forth -- had worked out an agreement that a portion of what was recovered would be allocated to what was then the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, and through the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees primarily it was decided -- I'm not sure if this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or a little bit later --</sentence><sentence id="445">3 to the Jewish Agency" and the Joint Distribution Committee.deg [phone ringing] The machine will pick that up, I hope.</sentence><sentence id="446">In any case, the Paris Agreement was one in which we were allocating the proceeds of the reparations which were scheduled to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">Now, part of those proceeds, obviously, were the assets of German, of the German entities, and German individuals located in the <span class="REGION">neutral countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">And that laid the background for the negotiations with the Swiss and then later with the Swedes and the Spanish and the Portuguese and, even to a certain limited extent, with the Turks.</sentence><sentence id="449">Because we knew there were a lot of German assets located in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>; <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had been right there at the center of Europe, it was a financial center and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="450">And there was no question but that there were a lot of German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">So we began these negotiations on the thesis that what we were after, in accordance with the Paris Reparation Agreements, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, as agents of all the other Allies, were to secure these assets which were located in the neutral countries and put them into the reparations pot, which would be administered eventually by the Interallied Reparations Agency, which had been established and which was functioning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">So, we began the negotiations with the Swiss, basically, on that thesis: That what we were doing was to look for the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and put them in the reparations pot.</sentence><sentence id="453">On the <span class="REGION">Swiss side</span>, the negotiations, as I said a moment ago, were useful, if you want to put it that way, because what they were aiming for was to get rid of the freezing and the blocking which was the result of the proclaimed list of certain blocked nationals, the formal name for the blacklist.</sentence><sentence id="454">So that we had some incentive on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> to go ahead and negotiate.</sentence><sentence id="455">On the <span class="REGION">Allied side</span>, when we started the negotiations, before we actually got into the negotiations, we began to 4 Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1922 and recognized in Article 4 of the Palestine Mandate as a public body to advise and cooperate with the British administration of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in economic, social and other matters that affected the establishment of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish National Home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">5 American Joint Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC) was founded as a philanthropic agency in 1914 to aid Jews in need all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="457">It played an active role in rescuing Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.</sentence><sentence id="460">4 think about this, and if we were thinking about taking over the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, we began to worry about what are, quote, the "German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>."</sentence><sentence id="461">And at that point, maybe before, it was certainly on all of our minds, but articulating it, we began to say the formula, "The enemies...or our enemies... are our friends."</sentence><sentence id="462">And we were not going to take over the assets, even though they had originated from somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, if they belonged to a persecutee.</sentence><sentence id="463">That is, the assets of Mr. Hans Schmidt, a good German Nazi, which were located in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, were different from the assets of Mr. Chaim Cohen, who had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or in someplace like that.</sentence><sentence id="464">Equally a citizen, formerly a citizen of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> who had deposited assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">So, when we began the negotiations, we had basically these, the overall objective of securing the German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and the subsidiary, but not very subsidiary, deviation from that objective, of exempting and making sure that the persecutees got whatever they possibly could get out of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q:How did you go about determining what those figures were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Well, in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we didn't determine what the figures were.</sentence><sentence id="501">The first thing we did, was to say in effect, "If there's a German asset, so-called German assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and you identify it, and Mr. Cohen who used to be living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, comes over there and says, "Hey, I was a persecutee, I survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, here I am, I want my property back," you, the Swiss, nobody else, takes that asset and puts it into the reparation pot." --</sentence><sentence id="502">Just as we, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, were returning the assets of persecutees who could turn up here and identify the assets.</sentence><sentence id="503">Even though they were, quote, in quotes, "German assets."</sentence><sentence id="504">We demanded that the Swiss do exactly the same.</sentence><sentence id="505">And as far as I know, there was never any objection to that on the part of the Swiss.</sentence><sentence id="506">And as far as I know, every German Jew who turned up in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and could identify his assets, got those assets back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="514">Q:Was that a significant number, do you have any idea how significant that number was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="516">A:I have no idea how many assets there were, but I assume there were a number of people, particularly perhaps, more from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> than from the other <span class="REGION">occupied areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">Because the</sentence><sentence id="519">5 Germans, in effect, had more notice.</sentence><sentence id="520">I mean, Hitler was there in 1932, "33, and it was a long time before the controls really fell into place, before the Final Solution was begun to be worked on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="521">And the German Jews were likely to be more prosperous than the Hungarian or the Rumanian Jews, although there were a lot of prosperous Rumanian and Hungarian Jews, maybe even Bulgarians, and Polish.</sentence><sentence id="522">So, the German Jews had some notice and, despite the fact that there were controls which were enacted by the Germans, I'm sure there was a considerable period of time when those controls could be successfully evaded.</sentence><sentence id="523">So, I suspect, a large number of German Jews actually did get their money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> [sic].</sentence><sentence id="524">One way or another.</sentence><sentence id="525">Maybe before the war actually broke out, maybe even during the war.</sentence><sentence id="526">The amounts, I have not the slightest idea.</sentence><sentence id="527">Really.</sentence><sentence id="528">I don't think we ever tried to make any evaluation of how many German Jewish assets there were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, say, in 1932, at the beginning of the war before things really began to get terrible.</sentence><sentence id="529">And so, we had no way of knowing how much would have been recovered by German Jews who came out.</sentence><sentence id="530">Whether the Swiss would have figures on somebody who turned up at the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, and was able to identify the bank number, and was able to say, "I am the survivor," or, "I am actually the guy who put the money there and I want to get it back now."</sentence><sentence id="531">And how many of those people actually turned up and got their money out, that I just do not know.</sentence><sentence id="532">I don't know whether anybody knows it.</sentence><sentence id="533">Maybe some people do, maybe if you went back and did this kind of study that Mr. Volcker is doing, maybe you could go back through all those old records and you could find that people did actually turn up and did recover their assets.</sentence><sentence id="534">I'm sure that a large number of them did.</sentence><sentence id="535">That is not to say that a large number of them did not.</sentence><sentence id="536">But a large number of them did.</sentence><sentence id="537">As I say, I suspect in the case of the German Jews, it would have been more likely that they got the money out than the case of the Hungarians and the others who thought that, "Well, it's not going to come here," the Czechs or whatever, who thought, "We are going to be protected."</sentence><sentence id="538">I know there was a lot of people in, say, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, who had money in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and who came out and then went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, because they thought that nothing was going to happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="539">But, in most of those cases, they had</sentence><sentence id="541">6 their families out before they went back.</sentence><sentence id="542">We know a number of people would back and then, of course, they got caught.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: We're talking about individuals now.</sentence><sentence id="573">We're going into the negotiations, what about other assets in <span class="BUILDING">Swiss banks</span>, especially the question of gold.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A:Well, the question of gold, there are two different questions there.</sentence><sentence id="577">If I can go back, the other assets you wanted to talk about, let me talk about the other assets.</sentence><sentence id="578">There were a lot of assets deposited in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> by German, Hungarian, etcetera, Jews, everybody was putting their money in, whether it was Jewish or not.</sentence><sentence id="579">But the Jews had a particular reason and a lot of those assets were never claimed.</sentence><sentence id="580">Because the people died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, not only they died, but all of their heirs and so forth died.</sentence><sentence id="581">Now, on those assets, those I take it are what we are talking about here, so far as these negotiations are concerned.</sentence><sentence id="582">There probably are still a substantial number of those around.</sentence><sentence id="583">Because the Swiss never did what I and a variety of other people urged them to do at the end of the war, do the kind of census that Mr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="584">Volcker and his group are doing at the present time.</sentence><sentence id="585">It's very difficult, I think, to get any clear figures down to the last penny or Swiss franc or whatever, as to how many of these assets there were, and maybe you could never really identify all of them.</sentence><sentence id="586">But, because we discovered here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when we tried to do a similar thing, it was very, very difficult to identify heirless assets.</sentence><sentence id="587">Just by names and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="588">But, to a certain extent, a lot of those assets did exist in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they could have had a census.</sentence><sentence id="589">Perhaps not as elaborate as the one which is being conducted now because it would have been timelier then.</sentence><sentence id="590">Now, Mr. Volcker has to go back over all these years and check back records.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="591">And <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> have disappeared, and accounts have been transferred, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="592">Then, that was not the case; they could have done a census and, while I don't think they would have been able to identify every heirless asset, particularly since names are ambiguous, as we discovered here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="593">The name Burger might be Warren Burger(ph) of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, it might be my friend, Raul(ph) Burger, who is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="594">And this Warren Burger is not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="595"><span class="COUNTRY">Burger</span> is a good German name, it just means an inhabitant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="598">7 But, in any case, we would not have gotten down to the last penny, but they could have done something at that time.</sentence><sentence id="599">Now, I think that they are going back, and to a certain extent, I think Mr. Volcker and his group, and maybe even the Swiss group which is doing some different kind of survey, will be able to locate some of these, the assets.</sentence><sentence id="600">So, what we were talking about in the negotiations, also were these heirless assets and we were trying to insist, we did insist, that the heirless assets be put in the hands of somebody.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: Who is that somebody?</sentence><sentence id="602">Well, if a German Jew came out and he identified the asset as being his own, he got it back.</sentence><sentence id="603">That we settled from the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="604">If he were not alive and neither was anybody else who survived him, the question is: What happens to those German Jewish assets which are, in a true sense, heirless?</sentence><sentence id="605">And there, all we could get out of the Swiss was a statement of sympathetic consideration.</sentence><sentence id="606">They would give consideration, sympathetic consideration, to the desirability of identifying those assets and making them available to one of the relief organizations.</sentence><sentence id="607">The relief organization we had in mind at the moment, was the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees, which was succeeded by the IRO, the International Refugee Organization.</sentence><sentence id="608">And both of those used, as a operating agency, the Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency for Palestine, I guess it was at the time.</sentence><sentence id="609">So, that was the situation with respect to heirless assets and the negotiations, as I say, came to a conclusion, not a very satisfactory conclusion on that basis, with the Swiss saying they would give sympathetic consideration to doing something about this, but without any firm commitment on their side.</sentence><sentence id="610">I think they regret now not having given us a firm commitment, and I regret it very much, and people who might have benefited from these assets would regret it, | suppose, most of all.</sentence><sentence id="611">So that was the situation with respect to the heirless assets.</sentence><sentence id="612">And we've been negotiating, fighting, doing something about them almost ever since.</sentence><sentence id="613">In my own case... and, I left the State Department in 1948, and I became... I went into the private practice of law, but one of my principal clients was a foreign relations aspect of the</sentence><sentence id="615">8 American Jewish Committee,deg and I worked on their behalf a very, very... a lot of hours, anyway.</sentence><sentence id="616">And did a lot of things in connection with Jewish claims.</sentence><sentence id="617">And one of the things I did was to continue to pursue this business of the heirless assets in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, so that sometime, I think, in 1951, I was in, actually went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and had a meeting with the American Legation as it still was then, the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span>, and we went over to the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Foreign Office</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Ministry of Justice</span>, I've forgotten which, to talk about this issue.</sentence><sentence id="618">And had a rather frustrating meeting over then, over in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="619">I think that was 1951.</sentence><sentence id="620">I would have to take a look at the record to make sure.</sentence><sentence id="621">So much for heirless assets at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A:The British wanted to re-establish normal relations with the Swiss.</sentence><sentence id="730">The Swiss had been a neutral country.</sentence><sentence id="731">The British lawyers had, perhaps, the same attitude that a lot of American international lawyers had, except that that seemed to me to be a little stronger in the <span class="BUILDING">Foreign Office</span> there than it was in the State Department here, maybe because I and a couple of other people like myself were in the State Department, but, basically, the attitude was that the neutrals had a perfectly good right to deal with whoever they were going to deal with.</sentence><sentence id="732">That, basically, is the essence of neutrality.</sentence><sentence id="733">And to a certain extent, that is a policy which had been established by the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> way back in the 1800's when we enacted the Neutrality Act.</sentence><sentence id="734">We were able to deal with the French when the British thought we shouldn't be dealing with the French in the French-British wars.</sentence><sentence id="735">But, in any case, we were very strong on this subject of not dealing with the Germans and, basically, we had no particular strength in retaining the proclaimed list.</sentence><sentence id="736">So we came to the conclusion that we might as well, the best thing we could do would be to conclude the agreements on the basis we did, which gave us the money we</sentence><sentence id="738">1 wanted, pretty much, so far as German assets, strictly German assets were concerned.</sentence><sentence id="739">Which gave us a statement that they would look sympathetically at the whole business of heirless assets.</sentence><sentence id="740">And we thought we could probably work out something on that and we would be able to get them to do a census so that we would be able to find out what the heirless assets were, and so that we could take those assets and turn them over to the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees.</sentence><sentence id="741">And that's where we were when we came to a conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="742">Satisfactory?</sentence><sentence id="743">No, this interview which was done with me in the Post, I thought it was a pretty good and fair story, a lot of my friends have told me that I shouldn't be too unhappy because I expressed a view that maybe we could have done better.</sentence><sentence id="744">Well, I've never been in a negotiation, almost never been in a negotiation, where I thought I had done the absolute best that I possibly could at the beginning of negotiation.</sentence><sentence id="745">And I am not now, and was not then, unhappy with what we came out with.</sentence><sentence id="746">I thought it was a reasonably satisfactory conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="747">But, not completely satisfactory.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="769">Q:Let's talk also about the issue of gold which we skipped over.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A:Okay, looted gold, I'll get back to that.</sentence><sentence id="772">There, you have to make a distinction with respect to the question of looted gold.</sentence><sentence id="773">The main body of looted gold that we were talking about back in those days when we started negotiating with the Swiss and with the others, the Portuguese as well, was the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of the Central Bank depositories.</sentence><sentence id="774">You have to know that the large amount of gold that was on deposit in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, was moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and maybe down to Dakar(ph) and re-smelted and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="775">But that was Belgian government Central Bank gold.</sentence><sentence id="776">And what we were then making sure of, trying to make sure of basically, was that the gold which was stolen by the Germans out of every <span class="BUILDING">Central Bank depository</span>, which was basically where gold was kept, was restituted at the end and that's the gold which we have, basically, gotten back.</sentence><sentence id="777">To the extent of about 60 or 70 or maybe even 80 percent of it.</sentence><sentence id="778">That is the gold which, basically, has been distributed by the International Gold Commission, a tripartite commission on gold, which is more or less affiliated with the institutions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, and which as been restored, a part of which</sentence><sentence id="780">2 has been restored even fairly recently, to the Albanians, who lost gold from their central depositories and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="781">That is one <span class="NPIP">aspect</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">That's the major part of the, quote, the "looted gold" that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and which was used by the Germans for their own purposes.</sentence><sentence id="783">The second part of the looted gold, was the gold which was taken out of the teeth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims, the gold bracelets that came off the wrists of women, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="784">And in that particular category of quote, "looted gold," unquote, we generally included looted gold and other assets because, in that same general category, we're talking about paintings, valuable silverware, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="785">All the valuables, the personal valuables that people would have.</sentence><sentence id="786">Now, a certain amount of that, going back strictly to the gold, was looted by the gold... looted by the Germans, and melted down by them, and used by them for their own wartime purposes.</sentence><sentence id="787">I hesitate a little bit when I say "wartime purposes," because I am reasonably convinced without having any particular proof of it, that a substantial amount of that went into the pockets of the individuals, the individual Germans who were there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, the guards, etcetera, etcetera, the people who had control of it, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="788">The Germans were pretty good at keeping track of things like this because they didn't want the guards to be profiting instead of the authorities back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, but I'm sure that, since in almost every other case there's been some individual looting, there probably would have been a considerable amount of individual looting in this particular case.</sentence><sentence id="789">So, some of that, though, may have disappeared into the pockets of the guards, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="790">But a large amount of that gold went back to <span class="BUILDING">smelting establishments</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and was smelted down.</sentence><sentence id="791">And then, probably, having been smelted, had the Reichsbank stamps put on it.</sentence><sentence id="792">And, all in all, probability, the Reichsbank stamps dated back five or ten years or something like that so that it looked just like gold that had been in the Reichsbank Central Bank depositories for years.</sentence><sentence id="793">Now, the Swiss knew at the beginning of the war, approximately how much gold reserves the German central bank did have.</sentence><sentence id="794">And they know that during the course of the war, more gold went through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> than was in those depositories at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="795">So, everybody there, I think, has been conscious of</sentence><sentence id="797">3 the fact that a large part of that gold had to be looted in one sense or the other.</sentence><sentence id="798">In the sense of having come from the central bank depositories of the, what should have been Belgian gold, or Albanian gold, or French gold or something like that, Central Bank gold, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, gold that came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or out of just stealing the stuff from the Jews who had not been put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but whose <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were looted.</sentence><sentence id="799">So, that gold has been a substantial part of the discussion.</sentence><sentence id="800">The question of what actually happened with respect to the gold that passed through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, or came into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, is, I think, one that maybe Mr. Volcker" and others will be able to find out more clearly about.</sentence><sentence id="801">A large part of that gold, I think, was just transferred back, transferred by the Germans, converted into Swiss francs, and the Swiss francs were used by the Germans to purchase whatever it was they wanted to purchase, war materials in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, or something else.</sentence><sentence id="802">Some of that gold probably remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">How much remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="804">I don't, I doubt that very much of it did remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, because I think it had all been used, to the extent that it possibly could be used.</sentence><sentence id="805">We did work out an agreement with the Swiss in which they would make a payment on account of looted gold to the International, the Tripartite Gold Commission.</sentence><sentence id="806">And a payment of that sort was made.</sentence><sentence id="807">Beyond that, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="808">How much of this gold can be identified as having come from the people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and how much their claims, therefore, should be, I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="809">I notice in the newspapers, there was some complaint about the fact that the amount of money that's still in the <span class="BUILDING">Federal Reserve</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, under the control of the Tripartite Gold Commission, some payments were being made to governments, like the Albanian government, rather than to individuals.</sentence><sentence id="810">Since the governments got back less than, a lot less than 100% of what was looted from them, I'm not sure that that's a legitimate complaint.</sentence><sentence id="811">I think the governments are entitled to get their gold back.</sentence><sentence id="812">How much of the gold that came out of teeth, etcetera, etcetera, actually went into</sentence><sentence id="814">4 <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, one does not really know.</sentence><sentence id="815">It may be, as people now tell me, nobody told me at the time, that one could identify the gold that came out of bracelets and teeth and so forth, as having had that kind of origin.</sentence><sentence id="816">Because that gold has in it, elements which are not found in the gold which comes out of a <span class="DLF">mine</span>, which is then smelted and cast into a monetary bar.</sentence><sentence id="817">But, on this, I really have very little knowledge.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="948">A:Cloaking in the sense of Swiss using their names to disguise the fact that a particular asset was really a German asset.</sentence><sentence id="949">For example, the biggest case, which was one, one that causes a lot of difficulty and which you find a lot about in the records of the Justice Department here and so forth, was the IG Chemie case.</sentence><sentence id="950">IG Chemie was a Swiss corporation.</sentence><sentence id="951">It was accused by us and by others of being a cloak for I.G.

basically, out of all sorts of sources, but I, I think, primarily, out of the sources that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in connection with the Hague negotiations, which, at Vassanar(ph) in which I participated in 1952 and "53, where we negotiated on behalf of both the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, as the two Jewish organizations, negotiated, negotiated there.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And then the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was represented on its own behalf and then, of course, the Germans, represented by, very largely by a, a first class gentleman named Boehm(ph), I can't remember his first name, B-O-E-H-M, who was a wonderful, wonderful guy.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And we did negotiate there, and there have been negotiations which have been going on ever since, and there has been a lot of money which has been paid into various accounts which, I think, has gone to recompense persecutees and their survivors, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I'm not saying, as I say, that the people who survived and the heirs and so forth, are not entitled.</sentence><sentence id="1362">They're very much entitled to everything that they, they could possibly get.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Certainly, they're entitled, if they can establish claims, to the property which was left by one of their own ancestors.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And certainly, also, they're entitled to whatever</sentence><sentence id="1366">8 amount may come into the pot which goes into a pot of heirless assets, basically.</sentence><sentence id="1367">But that amount that's going to go into the heirless asset pot is going to be minuscule compared to the amounts which have already gone in and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And that, I think, is probably true even with respect to looted gold.</sentence><sentence id="1369">There may be some looted gold which should be recovered, which has come out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but you have to remember, a large amount of that looted gold was recovered in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1370">It was recovered at the, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I know that one of the officials of the International Refugee Organization!"</sentence><sentence id="1372">came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with a couple of jerry cans filled with bracelets and gold teeth and so forth, and brought them into the American legation in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and by arrangement with them, they were taken over to a, a cooperating Swiss bank and they were...those things were all smelted down and the proceeds were paid to the International Refugee Organization for the account of the, of the survivors and so, paid into the, into the interest of the...probably through the Jewish Agency and the JDC, but they went for the purposes about...but most of that stuff was probably recovered in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1373">A large amount of it must have disappeared, as I say, a large part of it was confiscated, a large part probably confiscated by guards at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and a certain amount of it, certainly, went into the smelting pots and was eventually stamped and came out again as the, with the Reichsbank stamp on it.</sentence><sentence id="1374">So there may be some additional amount available there.</sentence><sentence id="1375">How much is a, is a matter which I think will be very difficult to tell.</sentence><sentence id="1376">One other thing about the Swiss, and the claim against <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, most of the money, I think, probably went...a lot of the money at any rate, went through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and did not remain, remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1377">I doubt that there's very much of the German gold still sitting there in a <span class="BUILDING">bank vault</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">Maybe there is some...Jew..some property still there, either gold bars or the things we also consider to be looted property, paintings, silverware, etcetera, not only in the, in the large <span class="BUILDING">Swiss banks</span>, but maybe in some "" International Refugee Organization: The major organization dedicated to the relief of refugees from the Nazi menace.</sentence><sentence id="1379">Also called the IFO.</sentence><sentence id="1381">9 of the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss private banks</span>, or in the hands of individuals in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1382">It's very, very difficult to, to tell about that.</sentence><sentence id="1383">I, I think the amounts that we're talking about, that have been talked about recently, are, are substantially exaggerated.</sentence><sentence id="1384">And, about the only thing I would like to add at the present time, is that I think the Swiss are, at the present time, maybe reluctantly and maybe under compulsion, making an effort to do something about it, despite the charges which were made just the other day that all this is on the basis of, of blackmail.</sentence><sentence id="1385">And beyond that, so far as the...my participation in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vassanar(ph</span>) and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> is concerned, about all I can say is that I was, as I said, a member of... was working with the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Committee was very, very much involved in these negotiations which set up the negotiations at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vassanar(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="1386">I was one of the four people on the, on the Jewish delegation representing the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1387">I think Moe(ph) Levitt(ph) representing the JDC, I representing, I don't know, a variety of organizations, I guess, certainly the American Jewish Committee, a fellow named Alec(ph) Easterman(ph) representing the Conference of, the Board of Jewish Deputies or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1388">And Maurice(ph) Bookstein(ph) who was representing, I guess, the Jewish Agency at, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And we were the four so-called principal negotiators.</sentence><sentence id="1390">Sitting up on top of us were Jacob(ph) Blaustein(ph) who was then President of the American Jewish Committee, and that absolutely glorious character, Nachem(ph) Goldman(ph) who then was, I guess, President of the Jewish Agency and the World Jewish Congress and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1391">And those were the two who did a lot of negotiating with...on behalf of these claims.</sentence><sentence id="1392"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nachem</span> in particular was a very...very close to Konrad Adenauer and Jacob Blaustein was absolutely essential, I think, in going to General Clay and other people in the United States government, and they did a wonderful, wonderful job there.</sentence><sentence id="1393">I participated in those negotiations in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span>... went on to be one of the few people together with Nehemiah(ph) Robinson(ph) who thought we would ever get anything out of the Austrians.</sentence><sentence id="1394">And Nehemiah Robinson was with the World Jewish Congress.</sentence><sentence id="1395">He and I were the only ones who thought negotiating with the Austrians was going to do anything at</sentence><sentence id="1397">0 all because the Austrians had been declared to be an occupied country by the Allies by, way back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="1398">And they were saying, who us?</sentence><sentence id="1399">We're not guilty.</sentence><sentence id="1400">And then we had some negotiations with the Austrians and in 1955, I initialed an agreement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with the entire Austrian cabinet on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> which resulted in the payment of about 50 million dollars into a so-called Hilth(ph) Fund, which was administered by the Jewish organizations, by the Committee for Jewish Claims On <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1401">The big distinction being that we got a conference for Jewish claims against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but a committee for Jewish claims on <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1402">It was supposed to reflect the difference.</sentence><sentence id="1403">And that fund was, as far as I know, administered.</sentence><sentence id="1404">It was inadequate, but it was something that the Austrians did pay in despite the fact that they were considered to be more liberated than, and an occupied country, than an ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1405">And that, I think, is about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
