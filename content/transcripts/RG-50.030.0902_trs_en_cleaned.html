<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Ah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: In getting people -- probably both Roma and Jewish people, helping them escape.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="248">The image that I have of my father was that he was red -- red hair, or red and -- with a red beard, possibly, or maybe just red hair.</sentence><sentence id="249">And having a radio playing, and he would be tinkering with electrical things, with the radio, maybe <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, taking it apart.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I later learned that he was an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="251">So playing with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> and things, and that there would be music playing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">So, in my very earliest memories, those were kind of the memories that I have.</sentence><sentence id="253">After a couple of years, after my mother was taken --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Wa -- did she come back?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Pardon me?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Ever?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Ne -- well, what I know was that we were all arrested, and we were incarcerated in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: But it was for about a month.</sentence><sentence id="266">We were all taken in March or April of 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: And you would have been three and a half.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Do you have any memories of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: I don't have memories of that, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: This is what I've learned, but I don't have memories of that.</sentence><sentence id="280">The memories that I have is that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, at some point, we moved to a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, or a <span class="DLF">fruit orchard</span>, about 60 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: East of Berlin.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: East of Berlin, so toward -- towards the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">And always sort of playing by myself in a <span class="DLF">field</span>, digging up potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="287">Why -- why potatoes?</sentence><sentence id="288">Maybe that's all there was in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">But being by myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: They were there, but I'm -- I'm just trying to recall memories.</sentence><sentence id="300">And digging up potatoes because I was always hungry.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: So you remember being hungry?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="304">Cold and hungry, and always being alone.</sentence><sentence id="305">And -- and then asking -- always saying to my sister, Gertrude, I'm so alone.</sentence><sentence id="306">Or, why am I always alone?</sentence><sentence id="307">So, I know that there was another family living in hiding with us, or at least on the same <span class="REGION">property</span>, and maybe there were children, but I have no recollection of being with other children.</sentence><sentence id="308">And maybe we did play together.</sentence><sentence id="309">I mean, here I was three or four years old, or four -- four to five years old, and only thinking of myself as being alone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: So, I want to step back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="318">The conclusion we can come to is that you had a mother for three and a half years, maybe, of your life.</sentence><sentence id="319">And then she disappears.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Gone.</sentence><sentence id="324">Just out -- out -- out of my life.</sentence><sentence id="325">But -- but I still had all my sisters and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="326">And my sister Gertrude, I think sort of filled the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of my mother.</sentence><sentence id="327">So I felt very close to her.</sentence><sentence id="328">And -- and to this day, I mean, she is a very motherly, nurturing kind of person.</sentence><sentence id="329">And so, my bond with my siblings is primarily to her, and to my brother Alphonse(ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: Not talking about things, and sort of keeping things hidden away from view.</sentence><sentence id="849">So once I moved in with the Spiegels, I actually saw my sisters and brother -- probably more my sisters, several of them, quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="850">But my mother, of course -- not of course, my mother, Rosalind Spiegel was in consultation both with the social workers at the Jewish Children's Bureau, and with a psychiatrist who recommended that contact with my siblings be discontinued, because I was too confused.</sentence><sentence id="851">When my sister would come over, there was always talk about don't forget Mama, don't forget Papa.</sentence><sentence id="852">We're all together, don't forget them.</sentence><sentence id="853">So, of course, I would want to be with them.</sentence><sentence id="854">Then, when I was with these foster people, soon to become my adoptive parents, it was difficult to relate to them.</sentence><sentence id="855">And I think I would lash out at them, or act out, especially towards my mother, my foster mother Rosalind.</sentence><sentence id="856">And she was then advised to stop contact.</sentence><sentence id="857">Now, when I say contact, maybe they came what, two or three times, and then it was decided that -- I mean, I was too young to really make a choice, but it was decided that it would be in my best interest to identify with this new family, so that they could become my family, so that I would be given the opportunity, you know, to have a stable home life, and not be torn between my loyalty to my German siblings, and my loyalty to my new American family.</sentence><sentence id="858">I did not have access to my papers, my German papers until I was an adult.</sentence><sentence id="859">So this would be 1958, 1960.</sentence><sentence id="860">And even then, when I called the Jewish Children's Bureau to say, I want to see my case file, they gave me a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="861">This is not public.</sentence><sentence id="862">I said, I'm not public, this is my case file.</sentence><sentence id="863">And I had to sort of argue with them, before they finally released the files.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="936">Q: So in other words, they -- they put it gi-- you know, and the way you are explaining it is, with the best of intentions, but the way they put it, it's either us or them, and it should be us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
