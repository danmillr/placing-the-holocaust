<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: Can you tell me where you were born and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Well, I can tell you where I was born.</sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which doesn't appear on any map in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">And I was born some times in March, but whether it was the 11th or the 13th or the 15th has been subject to serious debate, and that's simply because there were no records kept.</sentence><sentence id="9">Ah I would certainly have been an incubator baby but they never heard of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incubator</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">I would certainly have had a doctor there but they didn't have a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="11">I would have been sent to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> but there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">So it's a little difficult for me to be more precise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="20">Q: And what was your name at birth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: My name was Berell, and as a result of that I had to adopt a middle name at some time in my career, and I had known that I, knew I was known as Benny when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: Uh tell me what your. .</sentence><sentence id="25">name you were born with.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: The name I was given as an infant was Berell, which was the Jewish name.</sentence><sentence id="29">But when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they decided that was not a suitable name, and so I was called Benny.</sentence><sentence id="30">And ah, that time Benny Leonard was a big prizefighter name, and when I got on to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they decided to change that: Benny was abbreviated, so they called me Benjamin.</sentence><sentence id="31">And then when I needed a middle initial and I had none, I took "B." and then they had to say what did that .</sentence><sentence id="37">stand for, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">So by the time I got out of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> I was Benjamin Berell, or Berell, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferencz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: And where were you educated prior to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Well when we came as immigrants to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I was raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">I went through the typical type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> immigrant lower East Side beginning, and then my father got a job as a janitor -- they didn't call them "supers" in those days -- in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hell's Kitchen</span>, over on <span class="DLF">56th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Tenth Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">And there's where my earliest recollections begin.</sentence><sentence id="56">From there I went to the New York school system, the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">My parents were divorced when I was six, so I went out to live with an aunt who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and that's where I actually started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because I was too small and I couldn't speak English, so they wouldn't take me at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until I was seven.</sentence><sentence id="58">So I was off to a slow start, I was a slow starter.</sentence><sentence id="59">But my education was primarily in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">I caught up with my education by going to Townsend Harris High School, which was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for-- with accelerated curriculum.</sentence><sentence id="61">From there I went into <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and from there to <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: What did you major in at <span class="BUILDING">City College</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: At <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> I majored in sociology.</sentence><sentence id="74">And interestingly enough, I was always interested in crime prevention.</sentence><sentence id="75">Maybe that related to my early recollection in a highly dense crime area, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hell's Kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">If you look at a map of crimes in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, that was black because there were more crimes committed there than in any <span class="NPIP">place</span> else and that may have stimulated my interest in crime prevention, because there but for the Grace of might have gone I. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Were you an only child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: No, I had a sister, an older sister who was eighteen months older than I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: And did you both live with this aunt?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="101">When the parents were divorced they had to find their own way and fortunately both remarried and they both lived happily ever after and we all lived happily ever after.</sentence><sentence id="102">My mother and father were related, they were cousins, second cousins who were assigned to marriage at birth and it didn't work out but their subsequent marriages worked out very well and then we all became good friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: What made you go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: I always wanted to be a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="109">I don't know where it came from, and I don't know why, because I didn't know any lawyers but somehow I always wanted to be a lawyer and that's why I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Was there any particular interest in the law?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Yes, I was interested in crime prevention and I had no interest whatsoever in taxation.</sentence><sentence id="115">I thought "I'm never going to have any money, and I'm not going to defend anybody on a tax matter, I have no interest in corporate law."</sentence><sentence id="116">And so I was immediately involved in criminal law, and did very well.</sentence><sentence id="117">I won a scholarship on that at my first exam at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, and then I .</sentence><sentence id="123">went to work under one of these student aid programs for a professor of criminal law and criminal administration, Professor Sheldon Glueck at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, who was the leading authority in the field of juvenile crime.</sentence><sentence id="124">And that had an important influence on my later career.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: When you were in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, the War had started?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: No, the War started when I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">I recall the December 7th when Pearl Harbor I'm talking about the United States involvement in the War.</sentence><sentence id="142">The War was on in Europe, but the United States involvement began when I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">And I remember the day when everybody went down to--to enlist.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Were you conscious of National Socialism, what it was doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> prior to going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> while you in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Oh yes I was, very much so, but there was then a large movement to stay out of the War during the early years, an anti-War protest movement.</sentence><sentence id="151">And I think I was more inclined to be sympathetic to that movement than to anything else.</sentence><sentence id="152">There was a general awareness of the persecution of the Jews, for example, and I remember a protest rally which took place in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> -- I think my parents went down there -- to protest and call for a boycott against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the persecution of the Jews, so we were aware of that.</sentence><sentence id="153">But it was only when I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> that this Professor Gluck began to receive reports of the atrocities in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because he had been invited by what was then called the United Nations War Crimes Commission, had nothing to do with the United Nations as we know it today, to be the American member of that.</sentence><sentence id="154">And he funnelled all of those reports to me so I was very .</sentence><sentence id="160">much aware of what had been happening to the Jews [in] <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, beginning in 1939, because we got those reports in 1940-41.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: And these are very detailed reports?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: They were quite detailed in terms of the size of the massacres.</sentence><sentence id="177">We didn't have, you know, such details as pulling out gold teeth and making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> out of the hair but we knew that the Jews were being rounded up and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they were being exterminated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Were you an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Einsatzgruppen</span> reports?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="183">I never heard the word "Einsatzgruppen" until many years later, so we didn't have the characterization of the nature or the specific units involved in the massacres.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: When did you enlist?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: There's another story there.</sentence><sentence id="189">I assumed that I would go into the Army immediately when the War broke out, and I tried to get into different branches.</sentence><sentence id="190">I first applied for military intelligence, I knew French, and I thought I would be helpful and I knew other languages I knew some Hungarian and Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="191">But my parents hadn't been citizens for 15 years, and so I was disqualified.</sentence><sentence id="192">And then I tried to get into the Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="193">First, I was too short to be a pilot, and then I tried to be a navigator and then they changed the rules they were altered a bit and then I reapplied and then I failed on my eyes -- missed two letters on the 20/20 line.</sentence><sentence id="194">And then I tried to take training exercises.</sentence><sentence id="195">And while all this was going on I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">There's a very strange story; that my wife tells--there's somebody watching over me.</sentence><sentence id="203">To make a long story short, I tried to get in every branch of service without success, until I got out of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">I then went back to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">draft board</span> and I was very concerned that something had happened.</sentence><sentence id="205">And the clerk of the draft board came up to see me and I told him I hadn't been called up. "</sentence><sentence id="206">What's going on here?"</sentence><sentence id="207">And he had received a letter from the Dean, I think it was Dean Landis, in the middle of my first year, saying that it would take another month or two before I finished the first year and they should give me deferment until the end of the year so I wouldn't have a complete disruption.</sentence><sentence id="208">They had granted that and I thought then I could then go in.</sentence><sentence id="209">But they ah this member of the draft board came up to me afterwards and said, "How did you do in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="210">and I was very puzzled by that question, and he told me he had been a student at the <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span> in the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="211">And he had been wounded and had never been able to go back to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and his life had been ruined; and he just wanted to protect me from that kind of an experience.</sentence><sentence id="212">So it was a strange fluke -- I never saw the man before and never saw him again, but he reached his hand out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Why did you want to go. .</sentence><sentence id="241">.why did you want to enlist so badly when prior to this you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, I thought -- I could have stayed out of the War.</sentence><sentence id="245">In fact, one of the first doctors who examined me, you know, I just about made the height requirement and I was having trouble with my stomach -- I always had a nervous stomach -- and he said, "Well, you won't qualify" and I said, "Why not?"</sentence><sentence id="246">and he said, "Because we can't meet your dietary needs" and so on.</sentence><sentence id="247">But I always felt that I didn't want to ask anybody else to go and die for me.</sentence><sentence id="248">So I was trying to get in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Where were you first assigned?</sentence><sentence id="255">Where did you first go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, the Army of course immediately recognized my talent.</sentence><sentence id="266">I was fresh out of the <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> so they made me a buck private in the artillery and I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">supply room</span> as a typist; I couldn't type, of course.</sentence><sentence id="267">And as a matter of fact, they really did recognize my talent: Within 30 days they made me a Private First Class.</sentence><sentence id="268">So I figured out at that rate in 18 months I'd be a General.</sentence><sentence id="269">Well, of course three years later I was still a corporal.</sentence><sentence id="270">Leave it to the <span class="BUILDING">Amny</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">I didn't like the Army at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: I hated the regimentation always.</sentence><sentence id="282">I felt the Army, all armies, it was nothing particularly directed against the American, or the German Army for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="283">I think my hatred of the American Army may have equalled that of mine for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="284">I didn't know the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="285">But it's the dehumanizing process that takes place in an Army where as part of the training the first thing you do is take human beings and make robots out of them.</sentence><sentence id="286">And I refused to become a robot and that caused me endless grief in the Army because I was always being reprimanded and sent on KP and I refused to march.</sentence><sentence id="287">And I said that was the dumbest thing I ever heard of.</sentence><sentence id="288">I explained to my first sargeant that the reason people march is that it went back to Roman times when the soldiers had to carry their shields on the right side or the left side or over their head and march in formation because they were being attacked by spears from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">And if they didn't move in formation the spears could penetrate, and kill them, and therefore it was very important that they moved as a unit, and I said that was very important.</sentence><sentence id="290">I said, "If we are going to attack any Romans with spears on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> then that's the way we should march.</sentence><sentence id="291">But if we are facing a guy with a machine gun, and you march in formation, he'll kill you all.</sentence><sentence id="292">So what you have to do is not march in formation, .</sentence><sentence id="298">you have to run, to dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and run in opposite directions." "</sentence><sentence id="299">OK, wiseguy, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>."</sentence><sentence id="300">So off I went to the <span class="DLF">slop pits</span> and I cleaned more latrines and more <span class="DLF">slop pits</span> than anybody else in the Army, which is very good training for later life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: It didn't change you one bit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: No, it made my resentment greater.</sentence><sentence id="325">I think I hate all armies, and I am absolutely anti- militaristic, and I think the notion of training a human being to push a button which will result in killing a million people, or a hundred thousand people, and thinking nothing about it, is a horrendous thing to do, and incidentally that's exactly what the Germans did to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates.</sentence><sentence id="326">The first thing they did was dehumanize them -- shave off their hair; give them a number on their arm; lose their identity as people, and that's how you break the human spirit, and it works.</sentence><sentence id="327">But it didn't work with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: How long did you stay in this...where were you assigned first?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, first we went to basic training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carolina</span>, which is great, you know, because you march around, march all day, march up and down again, and you do all those absolutely ridiculous things that you do.</sentence><sentence id="335">And I kept on saying "There's a war going on, don't you, is there nothing more important that I can do than just march up and down here, you know, clean out the <span class="DLF">slop pits</span>?" "</sentence><sentence id="336">OK wise guy, back again into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>", you know.</sentence><sentence id="337">So it was a form of torture (laughs) I felt the United States Army was directing its torture at me personally, and it was a terrible time, and I had applied for <span class="BUILDING">officers candidate school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338">The Major at that time, or Colonel, on the examining board had been my classmate at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and sat next me, and he said "What are you doing here Benny?"</sentence><sentence id="339">and I said "I'm applying for .</sentence><sentence id="345">officer's candidate school."</sentence><sentence id="346">And he said "Well, of course, of course."</sentence><sentence id="347">And I had no problem passing it, but I was never called.</sentence><sentence id="348">And when we were getting ready to go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> my first sargent called me in and said "You want to be an officer, here's your application."</sentence><sentence id="349">He tore it up in my face and threw it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trash can</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">And my commanding officers felt the same way.</sentence><sentence id="351">I tried every means to get out of that outfit.</sentence><sentence id="352">I applied for the infantry, for the paratroopers, for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="353">And they called me in and threatened to court-martial me for showing disrespect for the outfit I was in and warned me that I would only go out in a box.</sentence><sentence id="354">So, I was in the wrong outfit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: What then happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Well, we went...we were being trained for the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we didn't know then but for wherever the landing would take place.</sentence><sentence id="381">And there was 115th Triple A Gun Battallion of which I was a proud private or corporal at the time.</sentence><sentence id="382">Eventually they promoted me to corporal, and there was the 116th and again when...we weren't on the first wave, but were supposed to go in very soon to shoot down any of the high-flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">The barrage balloons would have taken care of the low flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, and when D-Day came around and I was at the Land's End in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> waiting for the invasion, my outfit went over.</sentence><sentence id="384">It was a couple of days after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span> when they had enough <span class="DLF">beach</span> landed to justify it, and my Captain, who was a new captain on that job, came and he said "you stay here" and again it was one of those times when somebody reached out and I was left and off they went and it was several days later, or a week or so later, before I went across and rejoined my outfit.</sentence><sentence id="385">By that time the Germans had retreated from the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and I was perched on top of a <span class="DLF">hill</span> and manning a machine gun to make sure we didn't get any attack from the rear, but from there on in it was just chasing the Germans all across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">General Patton was the .</sentence><sentence id="392">0 commanding General, and his tactic was to pursue and chase and sometimes | felt it was a rather dangerous position.</sentence><sentence id="393">If the Germans had counter-attacked we had no way of repelling them, but they didn't, so off we went.</sentence><sentence id="394">And then of course I was with that outfit all across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I found out when I was finally discharged I had been in five campaigns and it was every campaign in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="395">From the Battle of the Beaches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> to the Battle of the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="396">But it wasn't necessary for me to be shooting people through the head during that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: So you didn't shoot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="418">I mean the outfit was pursuing.</sentence><sentence id="419">We were fired upon.</sentence><sentence id="420">And I was under artillery fire very frequently and tank fire, but we did shoot down a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, usually <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="421">We didn't call it friendly fire then, which was a nice euphemism we invented later.</sentence><sentence id="422">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that were coming in, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span>, they had a gadget called identification friend or foe which was supposed to give off a signal telling us that they were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span>, and either the had forgotten the signal or the equipment was off or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> had been damaged.</sentence><sentence id="423">In any case, we shot them down, and I had to go out on several occasions to pick up pieces of American flyers and hope that I could find a fingerprint or a bit of a finger to identify them, and the fireworks, of anti-aircraft fire, may look very nice on Fourth-of-July, but I don't go to Fourth-of-July celebrations.</sentence><sentence id="424">I don't like fireworks.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: I think we should stop.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="435">A: Thank you.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="442">1 Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: Ben, did it make a difference that you were a Jewish soldier?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: Certainly it made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="445">I was in an outfit which was commanded by antisemites.</sentence><sentence id="446">Most of the, or many of the people, let me say, in the Army were carryovers from the First World War, or people who couldn't get a job in civilian life, and a lot of rednecks, and very frequently I was referred to as "Jew Boy" and when I was given some of the dirtiest assignments I was told "You're a Harvard man, Jew Boy, do it again", you know, and they put me through it again and again sweeping the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and it was never clean enough, no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="447">And they just thought that was great, and they absolutely resented any effort of mine to get out of the outfit or to become an officer or anything of that kind.</sentence><sentence id="448">So there was a lot of antagonism between me and the military.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="454">Q: Was this typical?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="622">A: I don't know the exact number because I left.</sentence><sentence id="623">The trials were already on while I was there, but I left and they were still going on when I came back a long time later, a year or so later, and was prosecuting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="624">Those trials were still going on.</sentence><sentence id="625">To give you some idea of the flavor of those trials which I thought were terrible, I thought they were terrible: They bore very little resemblance to a normal due process of law and I must confess that I was partly guilty and responsible for that kind of behavior.</sentence><sentence id="626">I mean, I, if 1 had an SS man in my custody and he insisted upon lying that he wasn't even there when I had twenty witnesses saying he was there, he usually ended up with a confession.</sentence><sentence id="627">It was not that I had to shoot him through the head in order to get it, but he certainly was of the impression that if he continued lying I would.</sentence><sentence id="628">And under those circumstances I would always bring in an officer and tell him to go and get that confession again, because the one, the original one, would probably not stand up to close scrutiny.</sentence><sentence id="629">But the trials themselves at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> were, the judges were officers with no legal training, usually, who had no better assignment.</sentence><sentence id="630">The procedures were very informal.</sentence><sentence id="631">I'm not suggesting that we tried and punished innocent people: on the contrary, they were all guilty as <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, otherwise you wouldn't have tried them in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="632">You had too many guilty ones let loose, but, so I was not very impressed with the quality of the law work being done at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, on the contrary, in some of my letters that I .</sentence><sentence id="638">6 wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I said this is a disgrace, that, you know, we've forgotten our ideals and all that.</sentence><sentence id="639">So it was a difficult time and most of my more interesting times reallywere in apprehending the, some of these relatively minor criminals or collecting the evidence of these smaller crimes.</sentence><sentence id="640">There were also some massacres of civilians in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>, things of that kind.</sentence><sentence id="641">But nothing near like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1269">A: Well, there are so many memories it's hard to know where to begin, but one thing that comes to mind which struck me particularly at the time was the May First, the May Day celebration in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, I think it was Ebensee(r), where the inmates were celebrating their liberation and the May Day.</sentence><sentence id="1270">It was organized by the Communists who were in charge of most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> immediately after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="1271">They were the best organized.</sentence><sentence id="1272">There was a big tribune with Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill and there were going to be big speeches, but first there was going to be a parade of the inmates and they were broken down in national groups.</sentence><sentence id="1273">The Russians marched with a red banner, and the French and the Italians and the Yugoslavs and the Romanians and the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="1274">And then there was a group marching along, a bedraggled group, and they had no flag.</sentence><sentence id="1275">And I asked one of the inmates, "Who are they?"</sentence><sentence id="1276">And they said, "Oh, those are the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="1277">I said, "Why don't they march with you?"</sentence><sentence id="1278">And he said, "No, no, the Jews, they're separate, that's not us, those are the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="1279">So there was the antisemitism still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> after liberation as a reflection, you know, of the ethnic hostility which we see today in many parts of the world still, And another event which strikes me as perhaps noteworthy is that as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were about to be liberated, the Germans tried to move the inmates out, those who were still able to walk or to work.</sentence><sentence id="1280">They left those behind to be killed or to die who were too sick.</sentence><sentence id="1281">But they marched them out, and they were marching I think it was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> to march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1282">They took them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they marched at night, 8 A subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1289">2 and if anybody faltered on the way they were immediately shot; if anybody paused to try to pick up a potato or to eat a root or something they were shot.</sentence><sentence id="1290">I was able to follow this <span class="DLF">trail</span> through the woods of <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> -- 10, 20, 30, 50 killed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1291">And I would get the nearest farmer to say, "Dig them up."</sentence><sentence id="1292">They would say, "Oh yes, we heard firing there last night, there was shooting going on," "Where was it?" "</sentence><sentence id="1293">Over there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1294">And I would say, "Let's go" and we would go out into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and there would be a newly dug- up place and I'd say, "get some shovels" and I'd stop some Germans on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, "take these shovels, dig "em up" and we'd dig up the bodies of people who'd obviously been shot through the head; usually the top of the skull blown off, shot probably kneeling from the back, some of them were tied still; just lightly covered over with six inches of dirt, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1295">So I could follow the trail of crime being committed all along the way.</sentence><sentence id="1296">There was nothing you could do, I mean we were trying to overtake the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">column</span>; which by that time they'd already been liberated up ahead and some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> had taken over.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And one of the difficulties, I remember as an American soldier, to resist the temptation to try to feed some of these people.</sentence><sentence id="1298">We all carried emergency rations of chocolate bars, which were like a brick: you know we carried it in our gunbelt, in case you got into a jam you could hit it with a bayonet and break off a piece and survive that way.</sentence><sentence id="1299">But if we gave it to an inmate it was liable to kill them; and it happened, a lot of the Gls were giving away whatever they had.</sentence><sentence id="1300">I once had a can, a case of sardines I'd liberated somewhere and gave it out to the inmates; that was my first reminder I mustn't do that because it would kill them, if they ate a can of sardines it would kill "em.</sentence><sentence id="1301">You had to begin by feeding them soup for a week, begin with a very light soup until their stomachs and systems were built up.</sentence><sentence id="1302">So, you know, it's hard for me, where do I draw the <span class="DLF">line</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1303">I remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee concentration camp</span>, I'm quite sure it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>, too; there were mass bodies everywhere and we had to bury them right away because of the disease.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And we buried them outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="DLF">slit trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1305">We had .</sentence><sentence id="1311">3 <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, and we just, you know, you've seen people with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span>, I don't think we used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span>, we had the Germans pick them up and just carry them and throw them into this <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1312">A few years later I came back with one of my employees, Dr. Katzerstein, who became a key man in one of the organizations set up to help Nazi victims.</sentence><sentence id="1313">And his wife didn't know why we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I said, "I'll show you why" and I took them on a tour of some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1314">And we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span> and there they were all neatly marked <span class="DLF">graves</span> with crosses on them, you know, and I said, "That's a lot of baloney because I know, I was here when they were being buried and have pictures of me walking past this so-called <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1315">Well, they found names of inmates who had died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and just put a marker on, which I suppose is all they could do.</sentence><sentence id="1316">But, it was a nightmarish world and there's something very surrealistic about it and bears very little reality to what the normal human being would understand, even.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1372">Q: Do you consider the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> really "liberation" or was this accidental coming upon what you were doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1374">A: No, no, it was real liberation, that was not the primary goal.</sentence><sentence id="1375">The troops were moving forward and they stumbled upon many of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, they didn't know they were there.</sentence><sentence id="1376">In some cases the Intelligence had reports, and I had a map, a war map showing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at different sites of the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, so they knew we were there and we would move for them and I could tell we were probably going to hit that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in four or five days and get ready for it.</sentence><sentence id="1377">But what we didn't know was all these subcamps that were scattered all around.</sentence><sentence id="1378">There were hundreds of them!</sentence><sentence id="1379"><span class="NPIP">Everywhere</span>!</sentence><sentence id="1380">There were hundreds of them!</sentence><sentence id="1381">I have a list here of over a thousand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> run by Germans and German industry, and the Germans themselves didn't know!</sentence><sentence id="1382">We added another three or four hundred later, I don't .</sentence><sentence id="1388">4 know how many thousand we have by now.</sentence><sentence id="1389">So these so-called small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which may have had a couple of hundred people in them, they existed everywhere, and they were all so similar.</sentence><sentence id="1390">People were dying, they were killed, they were lying around, you couldn't tell the dead from the living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1410">Q: Did you, in terms of the feeding of the prisoners, were you told to not feed the prisoners or did you just learn this by --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1412">A: We learned it, we learned it.</sentence><sentence id="1413">I mean, there was no time to sit down and have big briefings.</sentence><sentence id="1414">It was a very, very mobile and hectic atmosphere of you know tension and movement and drama.</sentence><sentence id="1415">But you soon learned that if you gave somebody some food and you saw them choke on it and drop dead, you know, that you didn't do that again.</sentence><sentence id="1416">So it was not -- I never recall anybody giving a lecture about that but it was pretty well known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the medical men that came in began with intravenous feeding with just water and tea and a little soup, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1417">So we saw you know what was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1424">Q: How would you describe your mental state, going through these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1425">You were blocking yourself to feeling anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: It was very interesting as I look back upon it.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I think the human body has a capacity for survival which enables it to build up insulation, insulating mechanisms to prevent yourself from going mad.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And I do not recall feelings of rage.</sentence><sentence id="1431">I do not recall feelings of fear.</sentence><sentence id="1432">I do not recall feelings of hatred.</sentence><sentence id="1433">I do recall the urgency of doing something and getting the job done before it's too late.</sentence><sentence id="1434">So I went about my business as best I could -- and I did it, I think, very well -- by putting myself into a mental cocoon which was surrounded by an <span class="DLF">ice barrier</span> .</sentence><sentence id="1440">5 which just enabled me to go on.</sentence><sentence id="1441">And that little <span class="DLF">ice barrier</span> lasted until it melted, you know, but as long as it was necessary to do the job it remained there, as a self-protective device, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1458">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1459">Now you've gathered all of this material and the War Crimes teams have a lot of this evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Now what's going to happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1464">A: Now the higher <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> have got to decide what to do about war crimes trials.</sentence><sentence id="1465">The President has declared we're going to have war crimes trials.</sentence><sentence id="1466">Hitler and his henchmen had been put on notice that they'll be held accountable for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and whatever else they did.</sentence><sentence id="1467">The governments had to act.</sentence><sentence id="1468">They were not yet ready to act, the War had just ended.</sentence><sentence id="1469">The Army already had these records, we were all ready, we had the prisoners, we had to do something with them.</sentence><sentence id="1470">And in 3rd Army...there was a 12th Army Corps group headquarters, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.096561" long="8.215515">Wiesbaden</span> I think, they wanted me to come and work with them, I remember that; I got a letter from the General asking me if I wanted to be transferred to his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> -- it may have been Colonel Denson" who dealt with that, and I said, "Listen: I don't want to do his work any more than I want to do yours, I want to get out of the Army, that's all I want.</sentence><sentence id="1471">I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1472">But I recall, having nailed up the sign "Headquarters Third U.S. Army, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">War Crimes Dachau</span>," we decided we were going to have the trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1473">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was liberated by the 7th, not the 3rd, Army, but we were occupying, General Patton was there, and that was the site where we were going to have trials.</sentence><sentence id="1474">So we took these Army officers who'd been assigned to the Judge Advocate section not because they were lawyers but because they were at liberty and we needed staff and they had nobody 2 William Dowdell Denson, U.S. Army.</sentence><sentence id="1475">Prosecutor of the War Crimes Trials at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>. ;</sentence><sentence id="1482">6 else; and they were going to set up <span class="BUILDING">tribunals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1483">These were in fact military tribunals.</sentence><sentence id="1484">They're not to be confused with what happened later at the <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, which was an <span class="BUILDING">international court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1485">These were military-style tribunals which have existed under the laws of war for a very long time and they were staffed by military officers similar to a court martial, it followed the court martial procedure.</sentence><sentence id="1486">So they would have three officers, a colonel, a major or a captain, whatever; the highest-ranking was the presiding officer, the prosecutors were selected by the Judge Advocate group and they may or may not have been lawyers, sometimes they were, sometimes they weren't, they were a lieutenant assigned to defend So-and-So or to prosecute So-and-So as they would a soldier who had gone AWOL.</sentence><sentence id="1487">Then we had all these nice reports prepared by me, Nowitz, by a few other guys, Slotnick (ph) was another lawyer who came on board, and we had a fellow named Briggs who was a lawyer went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>; these were enlisted men and they did all the work.</sentence><sentence id="1488">And they had these reports, and based on those reports we would draw up the indictment.</sentence><sentence id="1489">I would draw up the indictment.</sentence><sentence id="1490">And the indictment would say that SS Major So-and-So is indicted for mass murder of so many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates at such-and- such camp during such-and-such period when he was in command.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And the evidence is: photographs obtained by the Signal Corps, statements from the survivors, my own affidavit or other affidavits from witnesses who were there -- usually not my own, I would certify as to the procedures whereby these affidavits were obtained.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And on the basis of that, the defendant would be asked, "How do you plead?"</sentence><sentence id="1493">And they'd say "I plead not guilty;" all right, let's proceed with the trial.</sentence><sentence id="1494">And they proceeded with the trial.</sentence><sentence id="1495">And some of these were quite interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1496">For example: if you're telling stories: I arrested a woman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grossgerau</span> (ph) which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1497">It was a typical Allied flyer case.</sentence><sentence id="1498">The typical Allied flyer is that any Allied flyer coming down under orders from Hitler was to be killed as a war criminal;

"</sentence><sentence id="1516">Don't tell me not you, Lady, because I know it was you.</sentence><sentence id="1517">It was your red shoe -- you've got a red shoe?</sentence><sentence id="1518">You beat him on the head with a red shoe, with the heel of the red shoe." "</sentence><sentence id="1519">Yeah, well, that's true but you know, it had just been bombed, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I lost my children, my husband was killed" -- she gives me big sob story, some of which may have been true.</sentence><sentence id="1520">And she was quite an attractive woman too, and a young woman, and I thought, well look, I got the guy who split his head and the whole mob was beating him up; I put her under house arrest, I didn't want to bother with, you know, interring her.</sentence><sentence id="1521">When that trial came up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, I happened to be there, and one of the guys said, "You handled the Grossgerau case, didn't you."</sentence><sentence id="1522">I said "Yes." "</sentence><sentence id="1523">Well, we've got the trial on." "</sentence><sentence id="1524">Well, I'll go over and take a look."</sentence><sentence id="1525">And sure enough, I spot this lady there and I spot the guy who did the job.</sentence><sentence id="1526">At a certain point in the trial-- this trial did't last long, it lasted a day or two and that was it -- this woman fainted in the <span class="DLF">dock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1527">A doctor went up and I said to the doctor, "I know that woman, what's wrong with her?"</sentence><sentence id="1528">He said, "Nothing to worry about," he said, "She's just pregnant, with an American soldier, one of the prison guards."</sentence><sentence id="1529">Now, there's the story.</sentence><sentence id="1530">Was she trying to avoid the death penalty by getting herself impregnated?</sentence><sentence id="1531">Was she in love with an American GI or with the GI attached to her?</sentence><sentence id="1532">I think she got about 18 months prison sentence or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1533">The guy who split his head was sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="1534">I don't know whether he was .</sentence><sentence id="1540">8 ever executed or not, maybe he was, they did execute some but not all.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And those trials came to an end while we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, because I kept an eye on them, sort of.</sentence><sentence id="1542">I think there was a Col.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Tomlinson who went down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to be one of the colonels in those trials, and they got orders from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> [that] we're ending War Crimes trials and so the presiding judge said "The War Crimes trials are over, everybody go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>" and the trials were over and the criminals got up and walked out of the <span class="DLF">dock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So that's how you deal with war crimes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1639">Q: So there were thousands of indictments that you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1641">A: Well, we didn't draw up thousands of indictments; there were certainly many thousands of criminals; that there were.</sentence><sentence id="1642">There were very few indictments, and fewer trials and few of which had any significance.</sentence><sentence id="1643">These were based on military pattern of military trials against American soldiers for violating the rules of the military code in one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="1644">That was the closest analogy to it.</sentence><sentence id="1645">They had no significance in international law, they had no political significance, really.</sentence><sentence id="1646">We had hopes, all of us who were involved in the early days, had hoped that it would be more than that, but by the time I left the Army, which was before I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, it was quite obvious to me that these trials were not to be given any historical significance at all; had best be forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="1647">But they are an early record of what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which were liberated by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1648">Our goal there was to try only those commanding officers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which had been liberated by the American Amny or those who had committed crimes against American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1649">And this is why we got into all these Allied flyer cases and things of that kind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1659">Q: Do you think it was a mistake to have these trials based on the military law and court martial law?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1668">A: No, it wasn't a mistake, because any time you bring anybody to justice even if it's an inadequate <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, it's better than not bringing them to justice at all.</sentence><sentence id="1669">Now, we could have followed the Russian pattern and just shot them.</sentence><sentence id="1670">I never really favored that -- I may have felt that way but I never favored that as a principle, as a lawyer it seemed to me it's not something we ought to do.</sentence><sentence id="1671">You may be interested to know the British favored that, and the Russians certainly not only favored it, they did it.</sentence><sentence id="1672">And there was quick justice -- sometimes Just, sometimes unjust, I'm sure they killed people who were undeserving, but if you adopt a theory that any person who sails on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pirate ship</span> must expect to hang from the yardarm, there was a form of rough justice.</sentence><sentence id="1673">And I'm not sure that the detailed justice in the so-called military commissions or <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> or whatever we called them at the time, was any better in the long run than allowing a rampage, as the Russians did, and cutting it off.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1680">0 Tape #5 Q.

and underneath were these tremendous Nazi Party files and the SS was there, the Gestapo was there, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1783">So we sent this crew out to scour these for incriminating evidence and outlined exactly what evidence we were looking for -- murder, crime, devastation without military necessity, rape, burning, destruction, racial; you know, we didn't use the word "genocide" in those days but, they were already trained.</sentence><sentence id="1784">I was briefed and filled out a form which they had to fill out what all the documents what related to the crime we were trying to prove.</sentence><sentence id="1785">Because two things were necessary -- and this is important, and the public doesn't know it: In order to have a successful war crimes prosecution, you need one, evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that specific known crimes have been committed;

and Justice Jackson had collected a tremendous amount of information in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> from captured Nazi archives.</sentence><sentence id="1806">So our job was to sort out this tremendous...by tremendous, I mean all the German records -- and the Germans are terrific at records, they keep everything in a hundred copies, except the secret ones [which] they destroyed;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2096">A: You know, I had a --a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2097">I had the documentary evidence chronicling specifically which units killed how many people, what types of people, in which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2098">I had very little staff.</sentence><sentence id="2099">I was the chief prosecutor, I had three assistants.</sentence><sentence id="2100">The defendants, 22 defendants were entitled to have one or two defense lawyers of their choice; the best Nazis money could buy, and they were very good.</sentence><sentence id="2101">I decided that I was going to prosecute the case, without calling a single witness.</sentence><sentence id="2102">And the reason I did that was because the documentary evidence spoke for itself; it was absolutely reliable.</sentence><sentence id="2103">It was their reports from the front.</sentence><sentence id="2104">At that time, I could have had available a thousand witnesses, any one of whom would have come in and sworn under oath that that particular defendant murdered his mother, his father, his children, and that he witnessed it.</sentence><sentence id="2105">I would have no trouble whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="2106">Not that they would all be lying, but that's the way they felt.</sentence><sentence id="2107">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> were all around me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, they were all -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133"

and -- and I decided I wasn't going to do that, because they would not be telling the truth, they would not be credible witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="2109">Their own emotions would be such that their memory would be distorted, and their testimony would be vulnerable.</sentence><sentence id="2110">So I decided to go to <span class="BUILDING">trial</span> on the documents alone.</sentence><sentence id="2111">Never had happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And I gave the defendants all of my records, these hor -- reports 30 days before trial, and I said, prepare your defense.</sentence><sentence id="2113">When I opened the trial, immediately of course, they challenged the validity of the documents.</sentence><sentence id="2114">Oh, they are fake, they are forgeries, the Russians have fabricated them.</sentence><sentence id="2115">The usual, you know, kind of business.</sentence><sentence id="2116">I'd been very meticulous with those files.</sentence><sentence id="2117">They had immediately .</sentence><sentence id="2123">0 been taken into custody of an

get away with that excuse.</sentence><sentence id="2126">And after three days, I rested my case.</sentence><sentence id="2127">These are the defendants, that's the man Ohlendorf, that's his report, dated such and such, which says we killed 90,000 Jews as of this time.</sentence><sentence id="2128">There's the defendant, that's the charge.</sentence><sentence id="2129">They killed 90,000 Jews, and so reported on this and this date.</sentence><sentence id="2130">I don't need any more evidence, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And I went down the list.</sentence><sentence id="2132">In

when I got back, what did I discover?</sentence><sentence id="2139">I don't know what the yu -- nobody would tell me what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="2140">And here I hear for the first time that Jews were being killed.</sentence><sentence id="2141">Can you imagine something like that?</sentence><sentence id="2142">Jews were being killed by my outfit, when I wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="2143">I was appalled.</sentence><sentence id="2144">You know, and they came with excuses.</sentence><sentence id="2145">Guys who for years have been every day killing Jews had the gall to come and say I hear it for the first time, that Jews were killed, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2146">And right down the list.</sentence><sentence id="2147">Wherever they found a document which was -- put the noose around their neck, they found some alibi, backed up by hundreds of affidavits, witnesses of all .</sentence><sentence id="2153">1 kinds.</sentence><sentence id="2154">The defense lasted six or nine months.</sentence><sentence id="2155">Nine months, they came in with all this baloney.</sentence><sentence id="2156">And the judge, Michael Musmanno, much to my unhappiness, I would say, said, whatever evidence they want to submit in their defense is admissible.</sentence><sentence id="2157">He passed what he called the penguin rule.</sentence><sentence id="2158">Up to and including the sex life of a penguin, it's admissible.</sentence><sentence id="2159">And I was furious because the rules of evidence, you know, these guys were lying.</sentence><sentence id="2160">Well, I wasn't going to take that.</sentence><sentence id="2161">So I called in our investigative division, as we were going along and I said, look, these are the defendants, this is their home address, this is what we know about them.</sentence><sentence id="2162">I want you to go to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, begin on the <span

information.</sentence><sentence id="2165">I want to know what did he write <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, where was he at the different times.</sentence><sentence id="2166">And sure enough, I'd find letters.</sentence><sentence id="2167">When he was supposed to be at his grandmother's funeral, he never had a grandmother, she died 50 years before, I checked that out, too.</sentence><sentence id="2168">That he wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to his wife saying, oh Gerta, did we have a day today, I was swimming in Jewish blood, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2169">And all the rest of it, all the rebuttal, and I had that for rebuttal.</sentence><sentence id="2170">Then I went on with the rebuttal.</sentence><sentence id="2171">You were at your grandmother's funeral?</sentence><sentence id="2172">Well, here we are, what was the name of your grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="2173">Grandmother so and so.</sentence><sentence id="2174">When was she born?</sentence><sentence id="2175">Well, I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="2176">When did she die?</sentence><sentence id="2177">Well, she died on that day.</sentence><sentence id="2178">I -- she died on that day?</sentence><sentence id="2179">That the same Gerta Koteso(ph) that died 12 years before?</sentence><sentence id="2180">Said, do you have two grandmothers by that name, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2181">And what about the let -- this your handwriting?</sentence><sentence id="2182">Did you write this letter to your wife, etcetera.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2553">A: No remorse.</sentence><sentence id="2554">The -- my biggest pain I think in -- in this whole experience, was the absence of remorse.</sentence><sentence id="2555">They were sorry for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2556">We also suffered.</sentence><sentence id="2557">What else could you expect?</sentence><sentence id="2558">The Jews brought it on themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2559">This was necessary for the good of the world.</sentence><sentence id="2560">This was the sort of sentiment, almost universal, not completely.</sentence><sentence id="2561">And it would be unfair to those few people who felt otherwise, and who tried to do whatever they could to help.</sentence><sentence id="2562">So I don't want to paint a whole nation, a whole people with one brush, but it was so widespread.</sentence><sentence id="2563">And in my trial one of them had --one of the defendants, fellow by the name of Klingelhoffer(ph), he had the decency to try to commit suicide -- unsuccessfully, unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="2564">But -- and he didn't ask for clemency at the end, they left him there til the end.</sentence><sentence id="2565">And he was the only one who really showed any sense of contrition, for which I admired him, at least to that extent.</sentence><sentence id="2566">But the others, I hear it for the first time, I don't believe it, just happened.</sentence><sentence id="2567">You're persecuting me, what else could I do?</sentence><sentence id="2568">You know?Superior orders.</sentence><sentence id="2569">It was necessary for the good of the <span class="COUNTRY">Fatherland</span>, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2570">So it's not easy to educate people, but if you don't try, then we're all in danger, you know, everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="2571">So I feel .</sentence><sentence id="2577">6 you've got to try, and that's what I'm trying to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2608">A: The defense attorneys were paid for by the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, out of occupation funds, I must admit.</sentence><sentence id="2609">But it was all expenses were paid.</sentence><sentence id="2610">The <span class="BUILDING">guest house</span>, as we call the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the defense council had their <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, and witnesses were kept, were excellent accommodations under the circumstances at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2611">They were fed, they got cartons of cigarettes, which was in great demand at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2612">All of this at no expense whatsoever to the defendants.</sentence><sentence id="2613">The defendants were given every possible right of trial, and the presumption of complete innocence, and they had to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</sentence><sentence id="2614">So they were absolutely fair trials.</sentence><sentence id="2615">If I ever commit any crimes, I hope I get the same kind of fairness.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2624">Q: So the subsequent trials were -- were conducted under the same rules of procedure as the Nuremberg trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2626">A: The Nuremberg judges had no rules of procedure when they began.</sentence><sentence id="2627">The charter of the <span class="BUILDING">international military tribunal</span> defined the crimes, and the jurisdiction of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, but left it to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> themselves to lay down their rules.</sentence><sentence id="2628">But since the judges were all distinguished jurists, the British presiding judge, for example, they knew the rules of evidence, they knew what was a fair trial.</sentence><sentence id="2629">And they had to merge different judicial systems; the French system, for example, is quite different from the American and the British.</sentence><sentence id="2630">The Russian is also quite different.</sentence><sentence id="2631">So, it was necessary for them to come up with rules of fairness, which they did.</sentence><sentence id="2632">They did very well.</sentence><sentence id="2633">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> we had the benefit of their rulings to guide us, and in addition we developed our own tules as we went along, all of which were then si -- published in a big volume, volume 15 of the green series, by the United States government.</sentence><sentence id="2634">So that this information is available for use in .</sentence><sentence id="2640">7 <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, or the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> in the future, if there are any such <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2641">And the fact that the rules didn't exist in advance, didn't mean that the decisions were unfair to the defendants.</sentence><sentence id="2642">I felt they were unfair to the prosecution.</sentence><sentence id="2643">But after all, the defendant is a guy on trial, so I didn't really mind it too much, although I was most annoyed.</sentence><sentence id="2644">Would never have gotten away in a -- in an American or a <span class="BUILDING">New York court</span> with the things which were admitted in evidence in the Einsatzgruppen trial.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2671">Q: Okay, let's stop this tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2679">8 TAPE #7</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2687">Q: Ben, I wanted to ask you something about what seems to be a controversy over the nature of the three indictment categories: Crimes Against Peace, War Crimes, and Crimes Against Humanity.</sentence><sentence id="2688">Can you comment on what became emphasized and what became de-emphasized at these trials, and why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2691">A: It's not so much a matter of emphasizing one against the other.</sentence><sentence id="2692">The first category that you mention, Crimes Against Peace, or otherwise known as Aggression, that has been perceived for a long time as being, as the Tribunal said in this case in the IMT" trial, the greatest of all crimes because it encompasses all the other crimes.</sentence><sentence id="2693">When you commmit a Crime Against Peace, an act of aggression, the war that follows invariably involves killing large numbers of people and the rape and the devastation and the destruction and every crime that you can imagine take place in a war.</sentence><sentence id="2694">So, commmitting a war of aggression is the most serious crime that any head of state can commit.</sentence><sentence id="2695">This was known after the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="2696">And efforts were made at that time to bring the Kaiser to trial for aggression against little <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, for example.</sentence><sentence id="2697">And this was hotly debated by international lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="2698">The Kaiser himself had fled to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doorn</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> where he was known as "the Woodchopper of Doorn" -- the Dutch refused to extradite him because there was no precedent for trying a head of state for the crime of aggression.</sentence><sentence id="2699">And the international lawyers who were dealing with it, including the American and Japanese, who were then on our side, felt that -- well, all right, in order not to have retroactive justice, they will not try him for the crime of aggression, because it had never been declared to be an international crime.</sentence><sentence id="2700">They would charge him, in the Treaty of Versailles, of "crimes against the dictates of human conscience," which had been referred to 4 The <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2707">9 in the Hague Agreements of 1899.</sentence><sentence id="2708">But that wasn't good enough, because a head of state had never been tried.</sentence><sentence id="2709">So the Dutch still refused to turn him over and he never was put on trial.</sentence><sentence id="2710">However, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, Justice Jackson, who was a first-class jurist, said, "Look, the time has come for the law to take a step forward."</sentence><sentence id="2711">The principle of non- retroactive activity is a principle of equity, you don't charge a person of a crime when he didn't know it was a crime at the time it was commmitted.</sentence><sentence id="2712">However, did not Hitler know that invading a state... a friendly neighboring state is a crime?</sentence><sentence id="2713">Did not everybody in the world know that?</sentence><sentence id="2714">So to declare that a crime does not violate any equitable principle, particularly in the light of all the precedents that we have.</sentence><sentence id="2715">We had the Hague Agreements in 1898, of 1907, we had the Kellogg-Briand Pact in 1928 saying that war is outlawed.</sentence><sentence id="2716">These pacts all had loopholes written into them, and then Jackson was certainly aware of that, but he said, "Look, the time has come and there's nothing unfair about trying these guys for the crime against peace, of committing aggressive war, even though "aggression" was not defined."</sentence><sentence id="2717">And Jackson dealt with that in his opening statement -- he said, Look: aggression has not yet been defined in legal terms but whatever it was, this is it, 1 know an elephant when I see one.</sentence><sentence id="2718">So he was deliberately takiing the law a step forward to do...to keep up with the common sense of mankind.</sentence><sentence id="2719">And it was based upon the long tradition which had already been established that the medieval notion of warfare, where the king goes out and kills, doesn't apply in modern times.</sentence><sentence id="2720">So that was the first and the most important principle out of the Nuremberg Charter.</sentence><sentence id="2721">Incidentally, all of these principles were then affirmed unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly, and they were also affirmed by the Tribunal which examined the thing, and I will tell you in connection with the Crimes Against Humanity, they interpreted it in a very restricted way.</sentence><sentence id="2722">The second one was the Crimes Against Humanity.</sentence><sentence id="2723">That connotation had never existed before and the theory behind it was: when crimes reach a certain magnitude, they shock the conscience of humankind.</sentence><sentence id="2724">They are crime .</sentence><sentence id="2730">0 not merely against the state, which happens if somebody murders somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, it's the State of New York against so-and-so defendant.</sentence><sentence id="2731">But it's a crime against all of humanity, and therefore humanity as the injured party has the right to be the plaintiff and can bring the charges for that crime.</sentence><sentence id="2732">That also was a step forward, but it was not an unfair step forward, it was a necessary step forward if you were going to have a civilized international society.</sentence><sentence id="2733">And in medieval notions, which were perfectly okay perhaps when a king lived behind a <span class="DLF">castle wall</span>, didn't apply.</sentence><sentence id="2734">So Crimes Against Humanity was another step forward.</sentence><sentence id="2735">The third category, War Crimes, that was a cinch: the Hague Agreements of 1899 had defined what's permissible in warfare, what's not, any violation and devastation beyond the needs of military necessity, rape, plunder, poison gas -- things of that kind -- these were well established crimes, they presented no problem.</sentence><sentence id="2736">Now there was a restriction put on by the <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2737">The <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> itself, in reviewing its own jurisdiction, said, Look: we have the right as international lawyers of great repute -- they were key people from all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> -- to examine the Charter and see whether the Charter is an exercise in creating new law or whether it is a legal instrument which we are bound by.</sentence><sentence id="2738">They said it's a legal instrument we are bound by because it enunciates principles which would be binding, and which are, binding law.</sentence><sentence id="2739">But, they said, because of the wording of the statute -- and it was an accident, really, for someone put a semicolon in, I won't go into the detail -- in order for there to be a Crime Against Humanity, it must also be linked with one of the other crimes, Crimes Against Peace.</sentence><sentence id="2740">And that meant that the killing of large numbers of people without a war would not be a Crime Against Humanity, would not be within the jurisdiction of the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2741">And that's what they held.</sentence><sentence id="2742">Some of us who'd been involved were shocked at that interpretation.</sentence><sentence id="2743">We said, "That's wrong!</sentence><sentence id="2744">We didn't have that in mind.</sentence><sentence id="2745">You mean to tell me that Hitler kills all his Jews and he's not at war with anybody else, that is not a punishable offense?"</sentence><sentence id="2746">That's what the <span class="BUILDING">Tribunal</span> said: under this Charter we cannot act.</sentence><sentence id="2747">So we changed .</sentence><sentence id="2753">1 that.</sentence><sentence id="2754">We changed that very specifically by a Control Counsel law -- the governing agency of all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time was the Control Counsel consisting of the four Powers -- Soviet Union, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, and the --which did I leave out? --</sentence><sentence id="2755">the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> And this Control Counsel enacted Control Counsel Law No.</sentence><sentence id="2756">10 which corrected that and said very specifically: Crimes Against Humanity are not linked to any other crimes, and that meant that if you killed your own nationals and the crimes were of such magnitude that they shocked the conscience -- that was not more clearly defined -- then it becomes a Crime Against Humanity, which is a different international criminal offense.</sentence><sentence id="2757">And that was then confirmed in the Einsatzgruppen case while I was pushing on that one and in one other <span class="NPIP">case</span> in the subsequent trials.</sentence><sentence id="2758">So that today, despite the confusion which exists among many international lawyers who write big books on the subject, the fact is that it is the legal right of nations to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity, and I think it is a legal duty on their part to intervene to stop Crimes Against Humanity.</sentence><sentence id="2759">And that has tremendous

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2847">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2848">Let me again clarify what has been a frequent misunderstanding.</sentence><sentence id="2849">I'm not talking now about the Army Trials at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2850">When the Trials were declared to be over by the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> because they didn't want to budget, everybody went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and all was forgiven, and that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="2851">Those who were still in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, I don't remember if they served; some of them did serve the sentence and some of them were hanged after that.</sentence><sentence id="2852">But I mean the trials themselves ended.</sentence><sentence id="2853">The subsequent proceedings, under the direction of General Telford Taylor, and there were 12 such trials, had to be reviewed, first by General Clay, who .</sentence><sentence id="2859">2 reviewed them and affirmed the sentences as being fair and correct, but the death sentences had to have a special order written out directing that the men be executed.</sentence><sentence id="2860">There were about 15 or 16 death sentences pending; over 13 came out of my Einsatzgruppen Trial.</sentence><sentence id="2861">When John McCloy came in as High Commissioner to replace General Clay, General Clay apologized to him for not having gotten rid of this nasty business, because there was an appeal pending before the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, they couldn't act until that was settled.</sentence><sentence id="2862">The appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the lot fell to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">McCloy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2863">McCloy had been the Assistant Secretary of War during World War II.</sentence><sentence id="2864">He was a very distinguished establishment lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, originally been from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, and he knew nothing, really, about the specifics of the trials or of those particular accused; he was familiar with the overall trials and in fact supported them in the Department of the Army when he was Assistant Secretary of War.</sentence><sentence id="2865">So he had his legal department study all of these records.</sentence><sentence id="2866">And he did something else: he appointed a three-member panel, a Clemency Board, to review the cases and make recommendations as to what should be done.</sentence><sentence id="2867">The principal officer was Judge Peck of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, who I think is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2868">There was one man from the State Department, and there was one who was a professional penalogist.</sentence><sentence id="2869">their instructions were to go over these files.</sentence><sentence id="2870">Their specific instructions, which is not generally known but which I dug out later -- they were secret at the time -- said: "You are not to review the correctness of the decisions in any case.</sentence><sentence id="2871">That has already been determined and is binding.</sentence><sentence id="2872">The only thing you are to reexamine are the personal circumstances of each defendant, such as his health, his family condition, or differences in the severity of sentences for the same crime.</sentence><sentence id="2873">So that if one got off easy, one got 20 years, another got 10 years for the same crime, you would recognize that as being inequitable and make a recommendation to bring that one into <span class="DLF">line</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2874">It was not, I repeat not, a pardon committee, they had no jurisdiction whatsosever, on the contrary, to challenge the validity of any of the decisions of the Tribunals of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="2880">3 their work.</sentence><sentence id="2881">Not generally known.</sentence><sentence id="2882">The Peck Panels, as they came to be called, sat down and then had to go over some of these files.</sentence><sentence id="2883">I happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> at the time, running the restitution programs, beginning to set them up.</sentence><sentence id="2884">I wrote to the Peck panel, I wrote to Peck and the others, and I said, "Look, gentlemen, I know you're here with a very difficult job" -- I was executive counsel then for Telford Taylor for all the trials but there was another additional job I took on, and I said, "I'm thoroughly familiar with all of the trials and should you require any information or any assistance in any way, I'm at your service."</sentence><sentence id="2885">They wrote back in a letter which will go to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, which I just recently uncovered, saying "Thank you very much but no thanks, we're only going to hear from the attorneys for the defendants.</sentence><sentence id="2886">We don't want to hear from any attorneys for the prosecution."</sentence><sentence id="2887">Surprised me at the time, and annoyed me at the time I must say.</sentence><sentence id="2888">And so the Peck Panel met, they had a few meetings together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they could travel all around <span class="REGION">southern Bavaria</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from there, and they did, spent the summer that way, and then they made their recommendations to Mr. McCloy.</sentence><sentence id="2889">And he then, together with General Handy"* who was dealing with the military -- some of the leftovers of the Dachau Trials -- they issued a Clemency Report which I will give to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, which I'm sure you'll find in the archives, in which they confirmed three or four of the death sentences, commuted the rest, usually to life imprisonment, lowered the sentences on some defendants.</sentence><sentence id="2890">The only defendant against whom there had been a judgment of forfeiture of all his assets was the multi-billionaire Alfred Krupp.</sentence><sentence id="2891">They gave him back all of his assets; and that was that.</sentence><sentence id="2892">That evoked a tremendous outcry of protest -- from the Nazi victims and from the Jewish organizations and from General Telford Taylor.</sentence><sentence id="2893">As a result, Mr. McCloy has not been in the good graces of either the Nazi victims or the Jewish organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2894">Now, I feel -- "S General Thomas Handy, U.S. Army.</sentence><sentence id="2895">Deputy Chief of Staff and later Commander of U.S. Army European Command in charge of operations. . ;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3009">Q: Why do you think he received such a rap?</sentence><sentence id="3010">Just because people have not investigated him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3013">A: Well, it's easy to criticize him, it fits into a pre-set pattern, you know -- that the Americans are wooing the Germans in order to get them to fight the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="3014">That's the Manchester pattern and it should be examined in that light and many people share that view, but it's a political opinion not based on fact.</sentence><sentence id="3015">And McCloy has also been criticized for not bombing the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and I discussed that with him at some length long after the event.</sentence><sentence id="3016">I did not intrude on him in what I recognized to be a personal decision that he alone had to make about the life and death of other people.</sentence><sentence id="3017">I felt that was something which should not be the result of political pressure.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And when I discussed with him the bombing of the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span>, I said, "Look: you realize that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> is in an uproar because of your failure to do that.</sentence><sentence id="3019">What was going through your mind?"</sentence><sentence id="3020">He said, "It was very simple.</sentence><sentence id="3021">First of all, the British, who are antisemitic, didn't want to, because they didn't want to divert their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> from winning the war, which they perceived to be the primary goal.</sentence><sentence id="3022">And we had to use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British bombers</span> for that kind of an operation because we divided our responsibilities into such-and-such-and-such.</sentence><sentence id="3023">I had a long discussion with Ben Rosenman, who was President .</sentence><sentence id="3029">6 Roosevelt's Jewish advisor in the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> at that time, about this whole issue.</sentence><sentence id="3030">And there were also strategic reasons.</sentence><sentence id="3031">First of all, you'd have to bomb them from a height where it was almost inevitable you were going to hit the inmates.</sentence><sentence id="3032">And if you start bombing <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of inmates, what is going to be the response politically on "The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> bombs Jewish inmates and the other inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>"?</sentence><sentence id="3033">And he said there was another strategic consideration: bombing <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> is a waste of time because they can be repaired immediately.</sentence><sentence id="3034">You bomb a few miles of <span class="DLF">rail lines</span>: so what?</sentence><sentence id="3035">They come with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail train</span>, they put a few rails down, so you've delayed them for an hour or two.</sentence><sentence id="3036">It isn't going to change anything.</sentence><sentence id="3037">On the contrary, they'll start killing them faster.</sentence><sentence id="3038">He said: "So in my judgment," he said, "and not only in my judgement, Ben Rosenman's."</sentence><sentence id="3039">So we took things to the highest level.</sentence><sentence id="3040">It was not the thing to do, it was not in the interests of Nazi victims to do it.</sentence><sentence id="3041">If they want to give me the rap, let them give me the rap."</sentence><sentence id="3042">I said, "Look: would you like to talk to them?"</sentence><sentence id="3043">He said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="3044">I had a long discussion later with him about the Krupp clemency action and the releasing of Krupp.</sentence><sentence id="3045">I persuaded him that he'd made a mistake, and he sent me a note saying, "If I knew then what I know now, after I've written Less Than Slaves and I...all the material, I would probably have done it differently."</sentence><sentence id="3046">I said, "Can I publish that?"</sentence><sentence id="3047">He said, "Not as long as I'm alive."</sentence><sentence id="3048">I will now give that information to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> and you've got it on tape.</sentence><sentence id="3055">7 BENJAMIN B.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3103">A: There were no rules whatsoever because the persons who were sending us out had not the foggiest idea of what we were supposed to do.</sentence><sentence id="3104">We knew we were supposed to do something in connection with War Crimes trials, but as an attorney, I, of course, knew the rules of evidence and what was required.</sentence><sentence id="3105">I had been interested in criminal law particularly, and of course, I knew what constitutes admissible evidence in a <span class="BUILDING">court of law</span>, and we were trying, of course, to collect that kind of evidence in order to make the convictions hold up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3109">Q: So, how did you make up these things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3111">A: Well, we had to improvise, as we went along.</sentence><sentence id="3112">We didn't have a regular <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span> where you call in a witness and examine him with a secretary present and somebody else cross examining or securing his rights.</sentence><sentence id="3113">We were taking testimony from friendly witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="3114">We were taking affidavits from them.</sentence><sentence id="3115">They would swear to it before an officer.</sentence><sentence id="3116">If it was from a hostile witness, we would interrogate him privately in order to see if we could ascertain the truth.</sentence><sentence id="3117">When we reached the point where we felt we had ascertained the truth, we asked him to write it out in his own hand and subscribe to it being true, and usually brought in an officer to witness that or to take separate depositions under more favorable circumstances from the point of view of trial.</sentence><sentence id="3118">That was the evidence that we then used.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3126">Q: What was the difference between you and Jack Nowitz in terms of technique or writing reports?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3127">A: Well, Jack was a much more stable fellow, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="3128">He was more cautious in his approaches, but he was more exuberant in his descriptions.</sentence><sentence id="3129">And when he would come upon a typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> scene, and had to write a report.</sentence><sentence id="3130">He would say, "These sadistic beasts, guards were murdering the people in cold blood, and it was outrageous and a violation of every act of human decency."</sentence><sentence id="3131">And I would have to calm him down and say, "Look Jack, we're just preparing legal documents to draw up an indictment.</sentence><sentence id="3132">You refer to them as the accused, you don't refer to them as the dirty bastards.</sentence><sentence id="3133">You refer to them as the suspected war criminals and by name and rank and you don't describe anything in graphic terms which would prejudice the person reading that.</sentence><sentence id="3134">Just describe the facts and the facts will speak for themselves."</sentence><sentence id="3135">We had a lot of fun actually together on that.</sentence><sentence id="3136">We were good friends, but we had a different approach in all our descriptions, and also in some of our interrogation methods.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3204">A: Well, yes because they were in the nature of military commissions.</sentence><sentence id="3205">Based upon the Army Standards of Court Martial, which was the general guide there, because they didn't have any other standards.</sentence><sentence id="3206">They were not trying to create new principals in international law like Crimes Against Humanity.</sentence><sentence id="3207">They were dealing with war crimes.</sentence><sentence id="3208">They understood war crimes, because war crimes were prohibited in the Manual of Military Conduct, and they knew that a war crime was devastation beyond military necessity.</sentence><sentence id="3209">It was rape, pillage, plunder.</sentence><sentence id="3210">These were things which had for many years been codified as the rules of warfare.</sentence><sentence id="3217">0 But they didn't deal with the question like aggressive war being a crime.</sentence><sentence id="3218">These were the things that came later with the <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span> and were generated by the fact that people like Justice Jackson, as well as some of the other British distinguished judges and lawyers who were represented on that.</sentence><sentence id="3219">These were people who were familiar with the broader principles and concepts of international law and international justice.</sentence><sentence id="3220">Whereas in the Army, it was just like, you know, another GL.</sentence><sentence id="3221">trial, where you bring in the accused, he's represented by another officer or another individual and the judges happen to be army officers who are available to hear the case.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3243">A: Well, there were many incidents at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and I suppose that you are referring to a particularly dramatic one which I've mentioned in other context.</sentence><sentence id="3244">Coming into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was always chaotic.</sentence><sentence id="3245">The bodies were strewn all around the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3246">The troops were chasing the Germans or the inmates had captured the Germans and were busy beating them or killing them, and you know people were dying all around.</sentence><sentence id="3247">What I would do, as a matter of procedure, I would immediately try to seize the records of what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3248">And every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Schreibstube</span>, <span class="BUILDING">writing office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3249">And what I would do, is I would immediately go to the <span class="BUILDING">Schreibstube</span> and try to find out who was in charge there, what was there, and seize whatever would be relevant for wartime prosecution.</sentence><sentence id="3250">And when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">Schreibstube</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, there was a inmate there who was a Schreiber, as they called them, and that was a favored position in fact in the camp if you would be in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Schreibstube</span> or the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3251">And he said, "Oh, I've been waiting for you."</sentence><sentence id="3252">And he said: "Come with me."</sentence><sentence id="3253">And I recall going out with him to the <span class="DLF">electrified fence</span> and .</sentence><sentence id="3259">1 his digging up a box of records which he had kept.</sentence><sentence id="3260">And those records were the records of all of the SS men, the identification cards who had entered that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and who had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and had their photograph on it.</sentence><sentence id="3261">It had their identifying numbers and addresses, date of birth, things of that kind.</sentence><sentence id="3262">And he was supposed to destroy each one of those records before a new one was issued or when the man left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3263">He didn't do that, which meant that every time he saved one of those records, there were hundreds of them, he put his life in jeopardy.</sentence><sentence id="3264">And he was ready to do that, hoping and knowing that one day there would be a day of retribution.</sentence><sentence id="3265">And he saved those records for that day.</sentence><sentence id="3266">So to me, it was a reflection of human hope and confidence and faith and courage which was very moving and dramatic for me.</sentence><sentence id="3267">Now, there was some other incident which happened here a few weeks ago.</sentence><sentence id="3268">I never knew who that man was.</sentence><sentence id="3269">I admired his courage and his faith.</sentence><sentence id="3270">And I never knew who he was and when I wrote about that in my book Less Than Slaves, I said he's a man whom I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="3271">And then a few weeks ago I received a letter from a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Paris</span>, the American University of Paris, Professor Pike who had written a book and in that book he had described, I think the book was called The Servants of Stalin or In the Service of Stalin.</sentence><sentence id="3272">He had described how communists had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and had fought on the side of liberating forces and when they were defeated by Franco they had fled into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3273">When the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the Germans seized them and sent them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen concentration camp</span> to be killed or worked to death.</sentence><sentence id="3274">One of those persons was in the service of Stalin, according to the book, was the man who handed me those records.</sentence><sentence id="3275">And Professor Pike identified him, and identified him by name, and identified another man in the camp who sends regards, who is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perpignon</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, who had been also collecting and hiding the death books registering the exceptional deaths that took place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> listing the names of all of the persons who had been killed by unusual means.</sentence><sentence id="3276">And those files were also turned over to somebody who signed on behalf of the commanding general of Third U.S..</sentence><sentence id="3282">2 Amny, A.P.O.403, and that's the way I signed most of my receipts.</sentence><sentence id="3283">I signed whatever was convenient.</sentence><sentence id="3284">But, I asked him if he could get a copy of that record, which the man apparently had kept with him all these years.</sentence><sentence id="3285">So, here, fifty years later, we have the coincidences coming out of the blue, the identification of the man who saved those records and one of his close buddies.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3338">A: Well, as the Nuremberg Trials wound down, the Einsatzgruppen Trial was over, I was engaged in two activities.</sentence><sentence id="3339">One was turning our records over to the Germans in the hope and expectation that they would continue War Crimes Trials.</sentence><sentence id="3340">You'll remember that we only had a very small sampling.</sentence><sentence id="3341">For example, in the Einsatzgruppen case, we had 3,000 men who were engaged in killing Jews for two years every day, and we only tried 22 of them, because of the number of seats we had in the <span class="INT_SPACE">court room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3342">But what about the rest?</sentence><sentence id="3343">We had records.</sentence><sentence id="3344">We knew who they were.</sentence><sentence id="3345">We knew where they had been, and there was material not only in that case, but all of the other 12 subsequent trials had many residual fall outs.</sentence><sentence id="3346">So, we set up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> what we called a Special Projects Division.</sentence><sentence id="3347">My wife Gertrude was engaged in that activity as well, and the object was to turn those files over to the Germans, and we negotiated with the various German prosecuting agencies to see if they would take those files and act on them.</sentence><sentence id="3348">In addition to that, we were trying to publish the records of the Nuremberg Trials, which subsequently came out as the "Green Series""(r) of the 12 subsequent trials.</sentence><sentence id="3349">And I was engaged in that as an editor right at the very beginning, and I think my wife was also working on that.</sentence><sentence id="3350">We also, incidentally, had a complete German text which was never the "ollowin, So named for the green binding of the poogeedings printed transcripts. ; ;</sentence><sentence id="3351">g transcript is the result of a recorded interview.</sentence><sentence id="3357">3 published, unfortunately, which may be around somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span>, but the Army decided it would be too expensive and had no useful purpose, and so they nixed it at the last moment.</sentence><sentence id="3358">It was never published.</sentence><sentence id="3359">So, I was doing this wrapping up thing, and looking forward to going back and resuming a normal life and starting a law practice in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3360">That was my intention.</sentence><sentence id="3361">One day I had a visit from a man who was the General Counselor to the American Joint Distribution Committee.</sentence><sentence id="3362">This is the Jewish organization which was the most active, and the leading one --the only one-- at the time in assisting the D.P.s in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, providing assistance to Jews, throughout the world, not in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, at that time it was all in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3363">And their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and their director was a man by the name of Doctor Joseph Schwartz.</sentence><sentence id="3364">And their counsel said, would I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3365">They would like to talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="3366">And I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and they said, "Look, we have a problem, and we'd like you to help us with that problem."</sentence><sentence id="3367">And that problem is this: that the Jewish organization had succeeded in persuading the U.S. Government to enact a law providing for the restitution of property which had been stolen, confiscated, or taken by duress by the Jews or from others, because the restitutional laws covered not only Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3368">And one provision of that law was that the heirless property, or the unclaimed property which had been taken from those who were no longer there to file a claim should also be restored.</sentence><sentence id="3369">Now, normally, if a person dies heirless in the state of New York or anyplace else, the property is escheat, they call it, or passes to the state.</sentence><sentence id="3370">But there's a principal law which says that they may not be the beneficiary of any unlawful act.</sentence><sentence id="3371">If you murder your wife, you cannot inherit her property.</sentence><sentence id="3372">If you murder the Jews, the state which is responsible can hardly be the proper recipient of the heirless property.</sentence><sentence id="3373">So, military government as a matter of military law, don't forget <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> surrendered unconditionally, and the only government there was the military government originally Quadrapartei, the four powers, later split up but each in their <span class="REGION">zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3374">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was responsible for the Military Government Law and the U.S.-occupied .</sentence><sentence id="3380">4 Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3381">And the military government law number 59, said that a successor organization of the appointed to recover the heirless Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="3382">The Jewish Restitution Successor Organization.</sentence><sentence id="3383">And the Jewish organization that succeeded into getting that into law didn't know where to begin.</sentence><sentence id="3384">So, they inquired about and they said, "Benny, we would like you to be the guy who sets this up.</sentence><sentence id="3385">You know your way around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3386">You know what happened to the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="3387">I was then a high ranking muckey-muck with the U.S. Army, and this was all military occupation at the time. "</sentence><sentence id="3388">We don't think anything will come of it," he said, "but we have a moral obligation to try.</sentence><sentence id="3389">And of course we don't have any money to put into this, we need our money for relief of the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="3390">We have enough to pay your salary for six months" which was I think six or seven thousand dollars all together, and would you undertake this for us. "</sentence><sentence id="3391">Well," I said, "I'll have to talk to my wife."</sentence><sentence id="3392">We were getting ready to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about two years, and much longer than we had expected.</sentence><sentence id="3393">So I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and I discussed it with my good wife Gertrude and she said, "Look it's true you know this business better than anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="3394">How long did they say it would take?"</sentence><sentence id="3395">I said. "</sentence><sentence id="3396">They said it might take two years." "</sentence><sentence id="3397">Oh," she said, "I know you.</sentence><sentence id="3398">It will only take one year.</sentence><sentence id="3399">So, all right, so we'll stretch it a little bit longer."</sentence><sentence id="3400">So, I agreed to stay, and I designated myself the Director General of the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization knowing that nothing would impress the Germans more than being a director and a general and so that's how it began.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3478">5 Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3489">Q: What was the date that the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization started?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3491">A: I was hired for that job in August 1948 and we had an immediate major crisis.</sentence><sentence id="3492">The law required that all claims be submitted by the end of that year, the end of December "48.</sentence><sentence id="3493">That was we had about three months, four months, in which to find staff, find funding, train staff, locate the property, submit the claims on long forms, because this was the first step in a long Judicial process.</sentence><sentence id="3494">Well, the first thing I did was to recognize that that was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="3495">So, as soon as I agreed to undertake the job, I resigned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and I went to see the Commanding General who was General Lucius Clay, who was the Commanding General for all U.S. Forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3496">I had known General Clay from before because I had been head of the branch in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> that had been collecting the evidence for the trials, and I went up to see him and I said "I've got this problem and I need an extension of the law."</sentence><sentence id="3497">I said, "I can't locate all the confiscated Jewish properties, hundreds of thousands of properties of all kinds all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in three months time with no staff, no money, no nothing, and we discussed the problem and he said, "No, I don't want to extend the law, because the sooner we get this problem over with the better off we're going to be.</sentence><sentence id="3498">This will be a thorn in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s side and I don't want to extend the restitution law."</sentence><sentence id="3499">I said, "All right, I'll tell you what we'll do.</sentence><sentence id="3500">I'll make a deal with you.</sentence><sentence id="3501">I will try to get it done, and I will only come back to you if it's impossible, but I will try.</sentence><sentence id="3502">But in order to get it done, I need money.</sentence><sentence id="3503">First of all, I need staff." "</sentence><sentence id="3504">Well," he said, "Didn't the organization know that when they wanted to get this written into the law that it would cost money to do that?"</sentence><sentence id="3505">I said, "You can't ask the Jewish organization which are now spending every penny they can raise to save the lives of these D.P.s to move them out of here and to rescue them to put money .</sentence><sentence id="3511">6 into trying to get restitution of Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="3512">I said, "I think we can take the money out of <span class="BUILDING">occupation funds</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3513">The United States Army was running on occupation funds, which meant the German treasury printed the money, and we used the money to pay for whatever we needed.</sentence><sentence id="3514">He said, "You know I can't get occupation funds because that requires Quadripartite approval.</sentence><sentence id="3515">The Russians are going to have to agree.</sentence><sentence id="3516">They'll never agree to using their money for private property claims.</sentence><sentence id="3517">I don't think the French will agree and I don't think the British will even agree.</sentence><sentence id="3518">And I can't do it on my own."</sentence><sentence id="3519">So I said, "Well, I have another proposition.</sentence><sentence id="3520">Let me borrow the money from the American segment of the occupation funds, and when I get restitution I'll repay the money."</sentence><sentence id="3521">He said, "Can I do that legally?"</sentence><sentence id="3522">I said, "I have a memorandum here which says you can."</sentence><sentence id="3523">He said, "Well, okay, if you say it's legal and I can do it, go down and talk to my finance man and tell him that's it okay and that whatever money you need to get going, but get going because I want to get this program over with."</sentence><sentence id="3524">So, I went down and I talked to a guy in charge of finance and I said, "I just came from the General and we're setting up a big restitution program here and we got a big rush job and I need enough funds to get this thing going," and he said "How much do you need?"</sentence><sentence id="3525">And I said, " A million marks." "</sentence><sentence id="3526">Okay, sign here."</sentence><sentence id="3527">A million marks was a hell of a lot of money and I signed here.</sentence><sentence id="3528">I was always ready to sign.</sentence><sentence id="3529">I signed promising to repay.</sentence><sentence id="3530">With that money I immediately went out and hired a tremendous staff of German investigators.</sentence><sentence id="3531">I had requisitioned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> from the Army using my old Army authorizations as a war crimes investigator.</sentence><sentence id="3532">I immediately seized every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> I could grab from any <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> and sent investigators into every real estate registry in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with instructions to copy down the names of any Jewish names that transferred property since 1933.</sentence><sentence id="3533">Very often the Germans had been very helpful to us, and they had stamped a J on the <span class="REGION">property</span>, meaning "Jude", so you could identify.</sentence><sentence id="3534">But it was a Jewish name, including Alfred Rosenberg, and it's true, we claimed the property of the big Nazi leader, Alfred Rosenberg, and the .</sentence><sentence id="3540">7 instructions were, you bring it in, and we're going to rush to get these claims out on a big complicated form.</sentence><sentence id="3541">So then I set up, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, there were a club that were occupied by Latvians, they were mostly drivers.</sentence><sentence id="3542">I knew the Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="3543">Many of them and the Estonians and were very busy killing Jews before they retreated with the Germans and were captured by the Americans and then used by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="3544">So, I said, "We'll throw them out of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3545">I need it for restitution."</sentence><sentence id="3546">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bango</span>, I move them out.</sentence><sentence id="3547">I move my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> as a prosecutor across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">Latvian club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3548">And we set up there a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span> is what is really was, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> right touching each other.</sentence><sentence id="3549"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Typewriter</span> on every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, requisitioned or bought or seized from somewhere and 24 hours a day we filed claims.</sentence><sentence id="3550">As they came in from the <span class="DLF">field</span>, as the investigators came in, they brought the claims in.</sentence><sentence id="3551">We had secretaries sitting there typing.</sentence><sentence id="3552">I took an eight hours shift.</sentence><sentence id="3553">Saul Kagan who was my Deputy and the first guy I hired took an eight hour shift.</sentence><sentence id="3554">Another man by the name of George Weiss, Dr. George Weiss who came from the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and later headed the Austrian operations, he handled the third shift, and about the day of the filing deadline, we loaded all the claims into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. Army ambulance</span>, which I had requisitioned somewhere, and there was a <span class="BUILDING">claims center</span> where we had to file these claims.</sentence><sentence id="3555">And we took this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and drove it up the <span class="BUILDING">claims center</span> and filed, I think it was 173,000 claims for 173,000 pieces of property in the American Zone of Germany.</sentence><sentence id="3556">And I called up Lucius Clay and said, "We don't need an extension.</sentence><sentence id="3557">We filed everything."</sentence><sentence id="3558">So, that's how we submitted the claims, but of course that was only the beginning of the process.</sentence><sentence id="3559">The system which was set up was that a person who felt that he had been forced to sell his property under duress or had it confiscated, was authorized to file a claim setting down all the facts.</sentence><sentence id="3560">That then went to a <span class="BUILDING">restitution agency</span> special judicial type agency, they weren't really <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>, to deal only with these claims.</sentence><sentence id="3561">And they would hear the counter claims.</sentence><sentence id="3562">Because the person who bought it would say, "Hey, wait a minute, I paid fair value for it .</sentence><sentence id="3568">8 because my friend, Mr. Cohen, was the neighbor next door.</sentence><sentence id="3569">I wanted to help him escape so I gave him 100,000 marks.</sentence><sentence id="3570">The property wasn't even worth more than 80,000 and as a result of that he escaped.</sentence><sentence id="3571">He sent me three letters when he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3572">I don't where he is now but he pulled out the letters and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3573">And he didn't file the claim because he felt fairly treated.</sentence><sentence id="3574">Who are you to come here and claim the property?"</sentence><sentence id="3575">Or, they claimed, they said, "Look, I bought the property.</sentence><sentence id="3576">It was bombed out.</sentence><sentence id="3577">It's only a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3578">I put on a new <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3579">The <span class="DLF">roof</span> cost me more than the property was worth.</sentence><sentence id="3580">Or there was a mortgage on the property.</sentence><sentence id="3581">I paid off the mortgage.</sentence><sentence id="3582">Who's going to give me back the mortgage money?"</sentence><sentence id="3583">And then the process began.</sentence><sentence id="3584">Or there were two or three claimants, some of the heirs claimed them.</sentence><sentence id="3585">They claimed, some other person said they bought it in between it had passed through several hands.</sentence><sentence id="3586">It was a complicated legal process which began.</sentence><sentence id="3587">If any party was not satisfied with the decision of the restitution agency, they could go to the <span class="BUILDING">restitution court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3588">That was part of the regular judicial system.</sentence><sentence id="3589">From there they could file an appeal to the appellate branch of the judicial system in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3590">And then there was a final court of restitution appeals which was composed originally of Allied judges.</sentence><sentence id="3591">Later, it was mixed American judges, who sat on the Court of Restitution Appeals, and they would hear the legal arguments and the factual arguments in all of these cases before rendering a final binding decision.</sentence><sentence id="3592">Their decisions are all published and I have them, and I have given them to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3593">So, this long legal process began, and for that, we needed lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="3594">When we got the property back, we needed people who would manage it.</sentence><sentence id="3595">We needed people to repair it.</sentence><sentence id="3596">We had <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>, hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> of all kinds which had to be managed and run.</sentence><sentence id="3597">And for all of this we had to train people.</sentence><sentence id="3598">It never had happened before in history, and we couldn't trust the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3599">We had to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="3600">I had access to all the Nazi Party files.</sentence><sentence id="3601">We hired nobody without a security check which meant you had a very limited selection because we had about nine million Nazi party files in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> .</sentence><sentence id="3607">9 to which I had free access.</sentence><sentence id="3608">So, it began and it was a very interesting legal process from one <span class="NPIP">point of view</span> to try to create precedents if I give you a few legal questions which came up very early on.</sentence><sentence id="3609">Let me just make two or three to show you how history might have been quite different with a few wrong decisions.</sentence><sentence id="3610">The first key issue we had was at what rate of exchange do you have to repay.</sentence><sentence id="3611">The principle of the law is simple.</sentence><sentence id="3612">Ifa person enters into a contract under duress, when that duress is removed, he has the option of undoing the contract, but he has to give back what he got, and he gets back what he gave.</sentence><sentence id="3613">These are the principles of law that I learned at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3614">They are principles of equity and they're not something invented by military government.</sentence><sentence id="3615">They should be applicable, and they are applicable in one way or another in all civilized societies.</sentence><sentence id="3616">But what happened was, when the property was transferred in 1937 or "38, let's assume the Jewish owner received 100,000 Reichsmark coins, by 1949 or "50 the Reichsmark no longer existed.</sentence><sentence id="3617">It was a Deutschmark.</sentence><sentence id="3618">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutschmark</span> was converted at a ratio of ten to one.</sentence><sentence id="3619">So he received a 100,000RM and he was giving back 10,000DM and the Germans said, Wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="3620">I gave you 100,000 marks.</sentence><sentence id="3621">You're now giving me back 10,000 marks."</sentence><sentence id="3622">If the Jewish owner had been required to give back 100,000 marks he would have said the property is not worth it.</sentence><sentence id="3623">I'm not going to put money into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s beat up old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there which has been bombed most likely, pay back 100,000DM which was then, an awful lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="3624">They didn't have the money for one thing.</sentence><sentence id="3625">It would be completely different.</sentence><sentence id="3626">I had a lot of problems with this.</sentence><sentence id="3627">I took this case to the Court of Restitution Appeals for the first advisor opinion before we began the program.</sentence><sentence id="3628">And the issue was who bears the burden of the loss?</sentence><sentence id="3629">Is it the victim, the Jewish victim, it didn't have to be Jews, the victim of Nazi persecution, or is it the Nazi or the German, it didn't have to be a Nazi, who acquired the property.</sentence><sentence id="3630">To my mind the risk of the currency devaluation should not rest with the victim who sold under duress.</sentence><sentence id="3631">It should rest with the person who acquired the property just as if he kept his money in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, he .</sentence><sentence id="3637">0 would have had it devalued.</sentence><sentence id="3638">And that opinion prevailed.</sentence><sentence id="3639">If the opinion had gone the other way, there would have been no restitution program in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, practically none.</sentence><sentence id="3640">I'll give you another case.</sentence><sentence id="3641">A very dramatic case.</sentence><sentence id="3642">The German Jews had mostly fled.</sentence><sentence id="3643">They were organized in what's called <span class="BUILDING">Gemeinden</span>; <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3644">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had their own Gemeinde, or congregation.</sentence><sentence id="3645">These are legal entities in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3646">They asked anybody who was a member of a congregation had to pay taxes to the state, and the state then supports the congregation out of these funds.</sentence><sentence id="3647">The German Jewish congregations had all been dissolved.</sentence><sentence id="3648">Their property had been seized.</sentence><sentence id="3649">Property consisted of old age <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span>, <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> of various kinds, <span class="BUILDING">lodge buildings</span> and the previous owners were scattered all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="3650">They were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span>, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>, wherever they could find refuge.</sentence><sentence id="3651">But some small groups had reconstituted themselves.</sentence><sentence id="3652">They came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3653">Very few of them had been members of that congregation before.</sentence><sentence id="3654">They came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3655">They came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3656">They came from other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, wherever they were.</sentence><sentence id="3657">And they reestablished themselves, and said we are now the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="3658">Some of them, having been forced to survive using all kinds of means were less than the most honorable or credible people.</sentence><sentence id="3659">To put it bluntly, some of them were a bunch of crooks as confirmed by their being arrested from time to time on various charges.</sentence><sentence id="3660">And they said, we are the owners.</sentence><sentence id="3661">For example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, they said, look we have set up a new congregation.</sentence><sentence id="3662">We are claiming restitution of the property.</sentence><sentence id="3663">And I said "Hold on.</sentence><sentence id="3664">You're not claiming restitution of property because I am the successor organization.</sentence><sentence id="3665">The JRSO, Jewish Restitution Successor Organization as designated by Military Government law."</sentence><sentence id="3666">They said, "No, this is our congregation."</sentence><sentence id="3667">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span>, whatever it was, and some of them were very valuable properties.</sentence><sentence id="3668">To make a long story short, I argued that case in the Court of Restitution Appeals, and I remember it quite dramatically, because I addressed the .</sentence><sentence id="3674">1 three American Judges whom I had known from before and I said, "May it please the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>," and I stood on this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, it was literally the same <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, and argued against the Nazis -- the prosecution of the Nazis who had murdered the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3675">I never thought I would stand here and argue against the Jewish community, but I have to, because those who are entitled cannot speak for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="3676">And I made the argument that those who are entitled are scattered everywhere and we couldn't give the assets to a small self-proclaimed group who were not subject to any kinds of controls, which we were of course as a charitable organization of the Military Government in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, under control of all the world's Jewish organization in the second <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3677">And I won the case.</sentence><sentence id="3678">It was known as the "Augsburg Case" because it was against the Augsburg community.</sentence><sentence id="3679">Some of those who argued against me ended up in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3680">But there again, if that case had gone the other way all the Jewish properties in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which had belonged to <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span>, would have been dissipated and would have disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="3681">So, we had several cases like that which were decisive on how this program was to be carried out and we had good luck, I think; well, more than good luck.</sentence><sentence id="3682">I think we were on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and being able to carry out that program for the recovery of thousands of pieces of heirless and unclaimed Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="3683">I don't want to run on too long, but if you would like me to give you some of the difficulties we encountered with that program, I think it may be of Jewish historical interest because in the end, we had to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="3684">And we did it in an interesting way.</sentence><sentence id="3685">What happened because of some of these problems of currency conversion and because of the Germans resented, understandably resented having to give up their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which they had lived in.</sentence><sentence id="3686">Or their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> which they had acquired and changed over the years in many ways that they had invested all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="3687">And there was no substitutes.</sentence><sentence id="3688">I mean, <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> was in great demand.</sentence><sentence id="3689">So, there was fierce resentment against this strange organization which comes along and insists upon taking the property back and paying only a small fraction of what has .</sentence><sentence id="3695">2 been given for the <span class="BUILDING">property</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3696">Or in an outright confiscation paying nothing, because very often whatever the Jew got was taken from him by discriminatory taxes of various kinds.</sentence><sentence id="3697">I said I'm sorry, you collect that from the German government.</sentence><sentence id="3698">You don't collect it from me, because you never go it.</sentence><sentence id="3699">So, it got to be a very, very bitter business, and it was generating anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which didn't need to have any anti-semitism generated in the immediate postwar or [post-] Hitler years.</sentence><sentence id="3700">And I could see that it would take a long time.</sentence><sentence id="3701">Meanwhile the Jews were being moved out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the D.P. camps to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, which itself was destitute, and it was at war, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put them.</sentence><sentence id="3702">They were in U.S. Army paramital tents which a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> the size of a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, which would have 15 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army cots</span> in it.</sentence><sentence id="3703">No water, put in open <span class="DLF">fields</span>, and this was a situation that called for immediate action.</sentence><sentence id="3704">And I had to generate money at once by every possible means.</sentence><sentence id="3705">So, I had to devise new techniques which I'll tell you about in a moment.</sentence><sentence id="3712">3 Tape #3 Let me give you a specific example of the type of problem.</sentence><sentence id="3713">There was a case that I recall where a woman had acquired the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a Jewish neighbor.</sentence><sentence id="3714">I don't remember if it was 1937, "38 somewhere around there, maybe even earlier than that, and no claim had been filed except by the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization.</sentence><sentence id="3715">We asserted the claim.</sentence><sentence id="3716">She made the usual arguments.</sentence><sentence id="3717">I was helping my Jewish neighbor, what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="3718">Who are you?</sentence><sentence id="3719">We said never mind, move.</sentence><sentence id="3720">We're going to give you back one-tenth of what you paid.</sentence><sentence id="3721">It so happened that she was the aunt of an American Army General, who not only was an American Army General, he happened to be the Commanding General of the District in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span> in which she lived.</sentence><sentence id="3722">And he called me up and he said, "What the hell do you think you're doing?</sentence><sentence id="3723">My aunt was no Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="3724">She helped her Jewish neighbor and they didn't file a claim because the were grateful to her, and how do you come off here filing a claim and demanding that she get out of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and your big deal you're offering her one-tenth of what she paid for it."</sentence><sentence id="3725">And I said, "Sir, I'm here to carry out the law.</sentence><sentence id="3726">That's what's provided in the law, and I think the law is correct.</sentence><sentence id="3727">I negotiate with your aunt.</sentence><sentence id="3728">I negotiate with others.</sentence><sentence id="3729">We try to reach a settlement.</sentence><sentence id="3730">We try to be fair in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> and not adhere to the last drop of blood or the pound of flesh.</sentence><sentence id="3731">We make the same offer to your aunt.</sentence><sentence id="3732">If she refuses, I will simply carry out the law which is a Military Government law, which you may recall, and I'm director general of that organization appointed by Military Government to carry out that law, and that's what I intend to do.</sentence><sentence id="3733">So please advise your aunt accordingly."</sentence><sentence id="3734">He said, "Like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> I will.</sentence><sentence id="3735">I'll show you."</sentence><sentence id="3736">And he called Mr. McCloy, John McCloy who was the High Commissioner for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3737">Mr.McCloy got on the phone with me and said "You know, I just got a call from General So- and-So.</sentence><sentence id="3738">I've forgotten his name actually, and he's raising holy <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3739">He says you're .</sentence><sentence id="3745">4 persecuting his aunt.</sentence><sentence id="3746">You're doing much worse than the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3747">You're trying to throw her out of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and all she did was help her Jewish friend.</sentence><sentence id="3748">And he's very distressed."</sentence><sentence id="3749">And I said, "Mr. McCloy, as a good lawyer, you know very well, that a transaction in 1938 was a duress transaction and it's voidable at the option of the person whose property was taken.</sentence><sentence id="3750">I am in the shoes of that person, and I exercise that option as I must to require that the transaction be rescinded, which is what I've done and that is consistent with the law and consistent with my notions of equity and justice, and I'm sure it is with yours."</sentence><sentence id="3751">And he said, "Yes, I guess it is.</sentence><sentence id="3752">I'll call up the General and tell him."</sentence><sentence id="3753">Well, that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="3754">Eventually, I think we settled with the aunt.</sentence><sentence id="3755">But we had this problem thousands of times, again and again recurring.</sentence><sentence id="3756">And it not only took time, but we were not getting the money we needed for these urgent tasks that I've described of saving lives and so I decided to take another approach.</sentence><sentence id="3757">And that was to try to sell these claims to the German government, to each state government, global settlements.</sentence><sentence id="3758">And I went to the Landerpresidenten, the Finance Ministries in the different German states in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hesse</span>, and I said, "Look, we've got this problem.</sentence><sentence id="3759">We are generating a lot of anti-semitism.</sentence><sentence id="3760">You don't want anti-semitism."</sentence><sentence id="3761">By that time the people who were in <span class="BUILDING">office</span> were anti-Nazis, otherwise they couldn't have gotten into <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and we've got to solve this problem. "</sentence><sentence id="3762">And the way I suggest I we solve it, I'll assign the claims to you so that you're not the beneficiary by way of this cheat but then you can settle them on whatever terms you feel are right.</sentence><sentence id="3763">If you want to give them back the property, that's your business, but you can't ask the Jews to make that sacrifice in order to maintain peace in your <span class="REGION">Land</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3764">And the first such settlement we made was with the Land Hesse, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> is nearby, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.096561" long="8.215515">Wiesbaden</span>, a big <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.096561" long="8.215515">Wiesbaden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3765">There are some funny stories connected with that but I won't have time to tell you, but that was the first settlement, for 25 million marks, that's a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="3766">Long before the Hague negotiations, I think it was 1950, 1951, it must have been, in which the .</sentence><sentence id="3772">5 state of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hesse</span> agreed to take by assignment all the claims of properties in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hesse</span>, the Land of Hesse; from the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization in exchange for 25 million marks down, now.</sentence><sentence id="3773">And then we did this with the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Lander</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3774">We went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3775">We had a very difficult problem in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3776">The man in charge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span> is a man whose name you'll find in your Holocaust Archives, Otto Kiister.</sentence><sentence id="3777">Otto Kiister was a very moral and righteous human being, a very strong sense of justice who was very helpful in connection with arguing the I.G. Farben appeal on behalf of slave laborers.</sentence><sentence id="3778">And I knew him quite well and I had great respect for him.</sentence><sentence id="3779">And he said "I will not accept the assignment of your claims."</sentence><sentence id="3780">I said "Why not?"</sentence><sentence id="3781">He said, "Because you will carry out the law as it is intended to be.</sentence><sentence id="3782">I cannot.</sentence><sentence id="3783">I am an official."</sentence><sentence id="3784">He was then in charge of restitution of the state of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3785">I will not be able to carry out that for political reasons.</sentence><sentence id="3786">And it's important that justice be done and therefore I will not accept your claims.</sentence><sentence id="3787">You do it."</sentence><sentence id="3788">I said, "Have pity.</sentence><sentence id="3789">I can't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3790">Look at the problems I'm having, the expense, the time, the aggravation, the anti-semitism that we're causing." "</sentence><sentence id="3791">No," he said, "You do it."</sentence><sentence id="3792">I never settled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden-Wiirttemberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3793">We settled every <span class="NPIP">where</span> else, but we fought those cases through, and that where this General's aunt was as well.</sentence><sentence id="3794">So, this is an illustration of not only a specific problem but a difficult political problem which encountered and an economic problem as well.</sentence><sentence id="3795">And we solved it legally by assigning our claims globally.</sentence><sentence id="3796">Making global settlements with all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lander</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3797">And then the states went on for many years some of them complained that they paid too much.</sentence><sentence id="3798">Some of them recognized that they had made a gain, because as the years went by the prices went up and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3799">But by and large, it was a fair and sensible arrangement as I look at it now in retrospect.</sentence><sentence id="3800">And it was a way to get out.</sentence><sentence id="3801">We had begun on a <span class="DLF">legal path</span> which seemed right at the time, but found it to be insurmountable as it went along.</sentence><sentence id="3802">So we had many such problems.</sentence><sentence id="3803">If you have time let me tell you some more.</sentence><sentence id="3804">Let me tell you another problem, which was a very fascinating problem in a way, too.</sentence><sentence id="3811">6 The problem is what do you do about Jewish cemeteries.</sentence><sentence id="3812">I know nothing about the Orthodox Jewish rituals, but I had enough common sense to realize that I wasn't going to touch that subject without strict control and guidance by those who knew more than I and were responsible.</sentence><sentence id="3813">Under the restitution law the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> were gone.</sentence><sentence id="3814">They all had their own <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3815">Every congregation had a <span class="DLF">local cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3816">Sometimes it was significant plot of <span class="REGION">land</span>, sometimes there were Jews buried in one <span class="NPIP">portion</span> and had not been used for the other <span class="NPIP">portions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3817">So, I set up a Rabbinical council, headed by Rabbi Herzog, the chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at that time, Rabbi Leo Baeck, who was the chief German Rabbi when they were driven out, and there was another German Rabbi who represented the Jewish communities in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3818">And these three were to give me the guidelines of what could be done with the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> once it's been restituted.</sentence><sentence id="3819">My instructions to the staff were we abide strictly by these rules, and the rules were: once a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>, always a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3820">You cannot do anything with the <span class="REGION">land</span> in which somebody is buried.</sentence><sentence id="3821">Even if a tombstone falls down, you must not pick it up.</sentence><sentence id="3822">You must leave it lying there, which was a surprise to me, of course, because all Jewish cemeteries had been desecrated.</sentence><sentence id="3823">But if there is an <span class="REGION">area</span> where there are no bodies, then it may fenced off and it can be sold provided it's not sold for a profane purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3824">What is a profane purpose?</sentence><sentence id="3825">You have to go back and look in the Talmud.</sentence><sentence id="3826">A <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> obviously is not a profane purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3827">A <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span> probably is.</sentence><sentence id="3828">A <span class="BUILDING">gambling casino</span> certainly is, so we had to know what was being sold and for what purpose it was being sold.</sentence><sentence id="3829">Let me just take a minute or two for a very amusing story, or it seems to me.</sentence><sentence id="3830">We had a situation of a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3831"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> is in the north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hesse</span>, is famous for the <span class="DLF">Fulda Gap</span>, where all the armies invade.</sentence><sentence id="3832">It's an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3833">Lots of <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, and there was a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span>, and it was a large <span class="REGION">area</span> and the social democratic mayor wanted to use part of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, which was in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, by the time the years had passed.</sentence><sentence id="3834">Originally it was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but it may have been a .</sentence><sentence id="3840">7 hundred years ago when it was started, now was in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and a quite valuable piece.</sentence><sentence id="3841">He said he wanted to use it as a custom <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3842">To build a custom <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, itt was right on the <span class="DLF">East German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3843">I inquired with Rabbinical Council, which I did very strictly on all such matters and they said custom <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, yes, that's okay.</sentence><sentence id="3844">I happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I was reporting to the Board of Directors, a very dramatic telegram.</sentence><sentence id="3845">They're building the custom <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they're digging up bones.</sentence><sentence id="3846">Well, the contract was very clear, there was a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> [in] which <span class="DLF">Jewish graves</span> were known to exist.</sentence><sentence id="3847">That <span class="REGION">area</span> was to be fenced off.</sentence><sentence id="3848">They were going to have a little <span class="DLF">memorial park</span> next to it.</sentence><sentence id="3849">The <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> itself had been desecrated completely, but we were going to have a little <span class="DLF">park</span> there with a plaque and the <span class="BUILDING">custom house</span> to be built in the <span class="REGION">area</span> on the blueprint where there were no <span class="DLF">graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3850">Well, that created a major problem.</sentence><sentence id="3851">And I rushed back, -- I sent a telegram, seek an immediate injunction.</sentence><sentence id="3852">Stop all <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, I'm on my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3853">And when I got back to -- I think we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> at the time -- I said, how far has it come?</sentence><sentence id="3854">Well, they already had about four stories on the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, big <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3855">And one portion of it was seemed to me over the <span class="DLF">graveside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3856">It was just a small <span class="REGION">area</span> of maybe 10 by 15 feet and I said "Tear the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down."</sentence><sentence id="3857">They said, "You can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="3858">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="3859">We have to live in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3860">You can't ask me to tear that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down."</sentence><sentence id="3861">What the hell were they thinking, it's a breach of contract.</sentence><sentence id="3862">Tear the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down.</sentence><sentence id="3863">It's their problem.</sentence><sentence id="3864">And they said we can't do that, their life will be unbearable.</sentence><sentence id="3865">I said well, let me consult with the <span class="BUILDING">Rabbinical Council</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3866">And I consulted with the Council, and they went into a meeting and conference and they finally came up with a solution.</sentence><sentence id="3867">And they said, "The Torah says that you may not have anything on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> except a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Prayer house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3868">So, what you have to do is raise the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and it's not the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3869">I said, "Raise a five story <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3870">They may know more about the Torah, but they don't much about engineering.</sentence><sentence id="3871">You can't raise a five story <span class="BUILDING">building</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3872">So, we went back to the rabbis and said you better look some more.</sentence><sentence id="3873">And then .</sentence><sentence id="3879">8 some genius, I don't know which one it was, came up with the solution.</sentence><sentence id="3880">If you can't raise the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, you have to build the <span class="BUILDING">prayer house</span> under the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> so that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> rests on top of the <span class="BUILDING">prayer house</span>, and there is nothing that says you can't build a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on top of a <span class="BUILDING">prayer house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3881">Only you can't build it on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3882">That's an idea.</sentence><sentence id="3883">So what we did, and to anybody that ever views this tape, I recommend they go and check it out.</sentence><sentence id="3884">In the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">customs house</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span>, there is a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which is a <span class="BUILDING">prayer house</span> built in accordance with specifications laid down in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, with inscriptions on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in Hebrew with stained glass windows and candelabra.</sentence><sentence id="3885">There is <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a Torah, there's an ark, but there is no Torah there, and that was built in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, excavated under the <span class="BUILDING">customs house</span> and it is the world's most unknown and unused, smallest <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that ever existed.</sentence><sentence id="3886">And I went to check up on that ten years later, and I came to the <span class="BUILDING">customs house</span> and I said to the concierge, I want to visit the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3887">They said, "Well, you go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and go down and turn down to the left, three blocks and then you turn to the right three blocks and there's the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3888">I said, "No, no.</sentence><sentence id="3889">I want to see the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3890">And he said, "This <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is the custom <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3891">I said, "There better be a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3892">Call somebody."</sentence><sentence id="3893">So he called somebody upstairs and they came running down and said Oh, yes, yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3894">They had a bunch of keys and took me down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and kicked some boxes away from the front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> and opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, "Is this what you're looking for?"</sentence><sentence id="3895">And I said, Yes, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="3896">I went in and I inspected it.</sentence><sentence id="3897">It was still there and I said, "Does anybody ever use this?"</sentence><sentence id="3898">He said "No, never."</sentence><sentence id="3899">I said, "Has anybody ever been in here?"</sentence><sentence id="3900">He said, "No, never."</sentence><sentence id="3901">I said "Do you keep it clean?"</sentence><sentence id="3902">He said, "We always keep it clean."</sentence><sentence id="3903">I said, "Fine, thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="3904">Keep on doing it."</sentence><sentence id="3905">So, go and visit the <span class="BUILDING">Customs House</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> and check up for me.</sentence><sentence id="3906">They are bound to do that forever.</sentence><sentence id="3907">Let me tell you another story about forever.</sentence><sentence id="3908">This is a very serious matter.</sentence><sentence id="3909">How long is a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to be maintained?</sentence><sentence id="3910">One of the things we worked out with the Germans .</sentence><sentence id="3916">9 was that they would be responsible for the maintenance of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish cemeteries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3917">Now, under German law, a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> is maintained for only twenty years.</sentence><sentence id="3918">The system there is every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> has their own <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, and everybody who is a resident of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is entitled to be buried in that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3919">And they go one after the other.</sentence><sentence id="3920">As you die, you're put in the row in a small <span class="NPIP">place</span>, very orderly.</sentence><sentence id="3921">The Germans are very orderly people.</sentence><sentence id="3922">And after twenty years, you're required to take away the tombstone or they'll take it away for you, and they put somebody else in the same <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3923">Saves ground, saves money, and I guess it saves emotional sentiment, they say after twenty they say stop grieving.</sentence><sentence id="3924">Well, they were quite prepared to do that, but as we were reaching the end of the twenty year period, they said "Now you take care of the cemeteries."</sentence><sentence id="3925">I said "Wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="3926">Jewish law requires the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to be maintained forever."</sentence><sentence id="3927">The said, "Forever?</sentence><sentence id="3928">It costs money.</sentence><sentence id="3929">You have to cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>, have a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around it.</sentence><sentence id="3930">It costs money.</sentence><sentence id="3931">We're not going to pay that.</sentence><sentence id="3932">If you have a peculiar ritual, we're not bound by that.</sentence><sentence id="3933">Why should we treat you better than we treat our own?"</sentence><sentence id="3934">Well, it got to be a very emotional argument.</sentence><sentence id="3935">A very dramatic argument.</sentence><sentence id="3936">I had just come back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3937">Anyway, the Germans were finally persuaded to accept the Jewish ritual, and they do maintain the cemeteries in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in perpetuity.</sentence><sentence id="3938">This was also part of the restitution program, things the public doesn't know anything

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4468">A: Since the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, JRSO, or as the Germans called it, JRSO"", was authorized to claim all unclaimed or heirless Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="4469">It also recovered thousands, many thousands of Jewish cultural objects, which had been assembled by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4470">For example, the Germans collected Torah scrolls.</sentence><sentence id="4471">A <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> full of Torah scrolls.</sentence><sentence id="4472">Tons of Jewish ceremonial objects taken from all the <span class="REGION">occupied territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4473">It was in Einsatzstab Rosenberg Special Unit, Alfred Rosenberg was the Nazi ideologue and it was named in his honor which had that as their assignment to go and seize all Jewish cultural objects and hold them.</sentence><sentence id="4474">The Nazis had various plans for them.</sentence><sentence id="4475">These were eventually assembled in a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.096561" long="8.215515">Wiesbaden</span> in the custody of the United States Army, and they in turn turned it over to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of which I was the director.</sentence><sentence id="4476">Now, thereto, out first goal was to try to locate the owners if there was a Kiddush plate or something that had the name "This is the family of so-and-so of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>" we tried to find out where the man was.</sentence><sentence id="4477">If it came from the congregation that still existed we tried to send it there.</sentence><sentence id="4478">We did the same incidentally with individual properties of restitution.</sentence><sentence id="4479">If the owner showed up later and said, I didn't file a claim on time or it was too short, but I'm really the owner, I'm really the heir, we worked out what we called an equity procedure of giving the property back to the real owners, subject to a very modest 10 percent I think it was service charge for the expense in getting it back.</sentence><sentence id="4480">So, here our first goal was to restore it to the rightful owners.</sentence><sentence id="4481">But usually you couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="4482">So, the next goal was try to distribute them wherever they were needed for Jewish reconstruction, the reconstruction of Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="4483">7 Pronouned "Ear-so."</sentence><sentence id="4490">1 And a separate entity was set up by the Jewish organizations to do that called Jewish cultural reconstruction.</sentence><sentence id="4491">And Professor Salo Baron of <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> was a member of our board of directors was in charge of that and Hannah Arendt was one of the persons who first came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to help guide us with what to do with these things.</sentence><sentence id="4492">Because I really -- I was a young fellow, I didn't really know anything about Jewish cultural life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and particularly the religious life.</sentence><sentence id="4493">So, we set up this Jewish cultural reconstruction, and we had staff.</sentence><sentence id="4494">We were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4495">This was the very early days, to come in to help us with that.</sentence><sentence id="4496">Hannah Arendt was one and then we brought in experts from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4497">There was a gentleman by the name Narcus, another Shanomi who came from the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to help us with the Kiddush cups and with the pointers and the Torah crowns and all of the objects.</sentence><sentence id="4498">We also had people restoring them.</sentence><sentence id="4499">We had, for example, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of scribes working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, to restore Torah scrolls, and I learned that a scroll can be repaired except if the word "Shaddai," or God, is injured in which case you cannot -- if that's been damaged you cannot restore that.</sentence><sentence id="4500">The Torah scroll has to buried in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, following a certain religious ritual.</sentence><sentence id="4501">All of which we followed very precisely.</sentence><sentence id="4502">I was very insistent on that.</sentence><sentence id="4503">I said "Look we take the law as laid down by the Rabbinical Council, and we don't vary that in any way and that is absolutely strictly to be observed."</sentence><sentence id="4504">And it was.</sentence><sentence id="4505">The <span class="BUILDING">School of Scribes</span> sat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> under the control of the JDC and they repaired those Torahs that could be saved, and the Rabbinical Council would advise where they were needed.</sentence><sentence id="4506">New <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, big recipients.</sentence><sentence id="4507">Congregations in other parts of the world where they needed some sent as remembrance scrolls to different communities throughout the world.</sentence><sentence id="4508">And we did the same with the ceremonial objects.</sentence><sentence id="4509">Where we could find the owner, we restored them.</sentence><sentence id="4510">Where we couldn't, we returned them.</sentence><sentence id="4511">Where it was damaged, we restored them, we then distributed wherever it was needed, and at the end we still had tons of broken silver.</sentence><sentence id="4512">Knives, forks, dishes, plates.</sentence><sentence id="4513">All kinds of little bits and scraps.</sentence><sentence id="4514">And the question was what do we do with .</sentence><sentence id="4520">2 that.</sentence><sentence id="4521">And I, being very careful, found a Jewish silversmith, Goldsmith Brothers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I said, all right we'll send it to them.</sentence><sentence id="4522">They cannot be repaired.</sentence><sentence id="4523">We cannot trace the owners.</sentence><sentence id="4524">They are just scraps.</sentence><sentence id="4525">Nothing can be done with it.</sentence><sentence id="4526">We'll smelt it down and we'll use the proceeds then for Jewish charity.</sentence><sentence id="4527">I thought that was being very clever.</sentence><sentence id="4528">And I went to the board of directors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where we had our annual meetings and I reported on the great care that we exercised in disposing of all these things and I was feeling very cocky and very proud of myself and I said and now we have received $50,000 for these silver scraps which we sent off to the silversmith Goldsmith Brothers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and they smelted them and they sent us the proceeds and this is now available for distribution by the charitable organizations.</sentence><sentence id="4529">Whereupon the first person to raise his hand a member of the board of directors.</sentence><sentence id="4530">A very distinguished elderly gentleman.</sentence><sentence id="4531">He is now and was less elderly then, he is still living, Isaac Lewin who was the Chairman of Augudat Israel world organization, and he said "Mr. Ferencz, do my ears believe me?</sentence><sentence id="4532">You took these holy objects and you sent them to a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="4533">Boy, I knew from that question that I was cooked, and I tried to explain the best I could that it was not really a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> it was just our way of trying to carry out our assignment and realized that assets to the benefit of those who survived.</sentence><sentence id="4534">I don't think he really ever forgave me for that.</sentence><sentence id="4535">But we did become good friends in later years.</sentence><sentence id="4536">But it's an illustration of some of the problems you know of dealing with this new <span class="REGION">area</span> which had never been done before.</sentence><sentence id="4537">We had paintings which we disposed of, and we had all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="4538">It was another facet of the restitution program.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4615">Q: What did Hannah Arendt do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4617">A: Hannah Arendt was there for a relatively short period of time, but she being very cultured, an educated lady knowing the Jewish communities of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> very well, she was helpful to us .</sentence><sentence id="4623">3 in identifying various ceremonial objects.</sentence><sentence id="4624">She knew what period they were from.</sentence><sentence id="4625">Where they might have been from.</sentence><sentence id="4626">Where there had been collections of it.</sentence><sentence id="4627">Let me tell you another story of collections.</sentence><sentence id="4628">Among the collections were, of course, many Jewish books, prayer books of various kinds, some incunabla.</sentence><sentence id="4629">"(r) I'm not sure exactly what that is but old Jewish books of great value.</sentence><sentence id="4630">The Germans had also collected such books, I mean the <span class="BUILDING">German Universities</span>, <span class="BUILDING">German churches</span>, part of their religious studies, and the Nazis had picked that up too.</sentence><sentence id="4631">So, the previous owners had been institutions that had legitimately acquired those books.</sentence><sentence id="4632">And they were quite valuable.</sentence><sentence id="4633">One day a Jewish rabbi, a chaplain I think his name was Bernstein, pulled up with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> to the back of one of these archives and selected some of the most valuable Jewish books, and filled up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> smuggling immigrants to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, as it was then known.</sentence><sentence id="4634">And so, these were books which had belonged to legitimate German institutions and had been lawfully acquired.</sentence><sentence id="4635">So, it was a case of unlawful confiscation.</sentence><sentence id="4636">And one day I got a call from General Clay, and he said "Benny, you better come up here.</sentence><sentence id="4637">We got a problem."</sentence><sentence id="4638">And he said, "I have this captain.</sentence><sentence id="4639">I'm about to court martial him for stealing Jewish German property.</sentence><sentence id="4640">And he said we have a restitution program here restoring property to those from whom it was unlawfully taken.</sentence><sentence id="4641">That doesn't mean you can go out and steal property from the Germans, and I think I'm going to have to court martial him."</sentence><sentence id="4642">I said, "Look, don't do that for God's sake.</sentence><sentence id="4643">Is that really necessary?</sentence><sentence id="4644">Mitigating circumstances, he thought it was Jewish property?"</sentence><sentence id="4645">He didn't know, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="4646">I said, "I'll get it back."</sentence><sentence id="4647">He said, "All right, you go and get it back for me."</sentence><sentence id="4648">I said "Okay, I'm going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4649">I have to deliver a shipload of prefabricated <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> bought from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> with restitution money.</sentence><sentence id="4650">I'll get it back.</sentence><sentence id="4651">Give me a list."</sentence><sentence id="4652">So he gave me a long list, I don't know ten, twelve pages of different books of which I didn't know nothing, "8 Incunabla generally refers to any broadsheet printed before 1500 with Gutenberg movable type.</sentence><sentence id="4653">In this instance, it likely refers to Torah scrolls and holy books.</sentence><sentence id="4660">4 and I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I meet with the government officials there of whom I was in contact with, the Finance Ministry mostly and I say, "Look, General Clay says I have to make restitution for this property.</sentence><sentence id="4661">Where is it?"</sentence><sentence id="4662">He said, "It's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4663">I said, "Let's go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span> and get it.</sentence><sentence id="4664">I got to bring it back.</sentence><sentence id="4665">I promised him I'd bring it back and they're going to let this captain off the hook."</sentence><sentence id="4666">Meanwhile they sent him <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4667">They sent him right <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, Philip Bernstein it was.</sentence><sentence id="4668">I said well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span>, and they said you can't go up there.</sentence><sentence id="4669">The Arabs are up there, it's between us and the Arabs.</sentence><sentence id="4670">It was the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4671">So, you can't go up there.</sentence><sentence id="4672">It's Hebrew, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span>, you can't get there.</sentence><sentence id="4673">I said, "When can I get there?"</sentence><sentence id="4674">He said, "When the war's over."</sentence><sentence id="4675">Good, I'll tell that to Clay.</sentence><sentence id="4676">So, I go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and I report to General Clay and I tell him, "Sorry, General, they're ready to make restitution, but the Arabs are there.</sentence><sentence id="4677">If you send me some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, I'll go get it, but otherwise you'll have to wait until things quiet down and then we'll get restitution.</sentence><sentence id="4678">And he accepted that.</sentence><sentence id="4679">And then, of course, he left shortly thereafter, and Mr. McCloy came in, and to my knowledge, that has never been settled by way of restitution, although we did have such a problem in the Hague negotiations with the Germans, and I think the Templars, a German society, whose land was taken in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they made some kind of a deal which may have incorporated some of these books.</sentence><sentence id="4680">I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4681">But it was a case of the Jewish organization being required to make restitution.</sentence><sentence id="4682">Whether they did or not, I really cannot swear.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4853">Q: Was it helpful -- <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> helpful or always harmful?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4855">A: Well, it's hard to answer that question.</sentence><sentence id="4856">I did have a discussion with this Doctor Schwartz in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> about that.</sentence><sentence id="4857">It's interesting that you should raise it.</sentence><sentence id="4858">The Jews were receiving from the JDC equivalent of CARE parcels.</sentence><sentence id="4859">They were parcels containing various things that they needed, sugar, coffee, clothing, material to make [clothing], and the JDC was sending in mostly cigarettes, because that was the most negotiable item.</sentence><sentence id="4860">And I discussed that with Joe Schwartz from a moral point of view.</sentence><sentence id="4861">I said, "Look, all the DP are now trading cigarettes, it's illegal, it's <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4862">Don't you think you are better off setting up <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> rather than just sending in these things.</sentence><sentence id="4863">They're all on their own."</sentence><sentence id="4864">Which meant that they .</sentence><sentence id="4870">7 were all engaging in illegal activities.</sentence><sentence id="4871">And he said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="4872">I think that, first of all, we get much more bang for our buck this way."</sentence><sentence id="4873">You know, this was the currency of trade.</sentence><sentence id="4874">The cigarettes were cheap, and you can buy a lot for it, and we need -- we're short of funds," as they always were. "</sentence><sentence id="4875">Secondly," he said, "it's an outlet for their emotions and they were returned to normal life once they are taken out of this atmosphere."</sentence><sentence id="4876">So that my concern was that their moral standards would be destroyed by engaging in illegal activities.</sentence><sentence id="4877">They would lose all respect for law.</sentence><sentence id="4878">And I couldn't persuade him was the end of it, and in retrospect, he probably was right, because in order to survive, legality was rather irrelevant.</sentence><sentence id="4879">They were living in an unlawful world, an unlawful state.</sentence><sentence id="4880">And they did whatever they had to do in order to survive, and in that kind of atmosphere to come as I was inclined to do, being a lawyer, with notions of strict legality, was unrealistic and perhaps unfair.</sentence><sentence id="4881">And I was overly concerned about that.</sentence><sentence id="4882">Anyway, the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> did, in time, as the economy improved, disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="4883">I'm not sure that it did any big harm anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4884">It exchanged goods; a lot of German goods were exchanged for a lot of cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="4885">But, another form of restitution, perhaps, but I don't think it had any permanent significance.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4942">Q: What was done to help the victims with their own injuries?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4944">A: That seems to me to be perhaps the most important, or next to the most important phase of dealing with Holocaust problems.</sentence><sentence id="4945">Holocaust begins with stopping the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4946">Wars are holocausts, worst forms of holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4947">The next phase is to hold accountable those who brought it on.</sentence><sentence id="4948">These are the war crimes trials.</sentence><sentence id="4949">The third phase is trying to restore what had been destroyed or taken during the war, that's the restitution program, and then the next phase is the victims.</sentence><sentence id="4950">What about the victims?</sentence><sentence id="4951">People tend to forget in the drama of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>, they think ah, the criminals are punished; it's over.</sentence><sentence id="4952">It's not over.</sentence><sentence id="4953">The victims are more important than the criminals.</sentence><sentence id="4954">Criminals can be punished or killed.</sentence><sentence id="4955">It doesn't make a big difference unless it's a deterrent to the repetition of the crimes.</sentence><sentence id="4956">But what do you do about those who survived?</sentence><sentence id="4957">And this was a problem which was not addressed by military government except in the very crudest way of seeking compensation for time spent in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but it's much more complicated than that.</sentence><sentence id="4958">The victims suffered all kinds of losses, and if you approach the problem legally, then it requires a completely different and much more expanded approach and that was the next thing that happened.</sentence><sentence id="4959">If you want me to tell you about that now, I'll tell you how it began, and how it was approached.</sentence><sentence id="4960">The notion that the individual survivors of Nazi persecution, Jewish or non-Jewish, should be compensated for their injuries is an old notion.</sentence><sentence id="4961">It was quite obvious to anyone who was concerned with the subject, and people had begun to write about it in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, about compensating victims of personal injuries.</sentence><sentence id="4962"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was eager to reenter the family of nations.</sentence><sentence id="4963">Konrad Adenauer was a devote Catholic, anti-Nazi who had been saved by the help of Jewish friends when the Nazis had been trying to drive him out as mayor of .</sentence><sentence id="4969">9 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, and he was very eager in fact to find some way of reaching out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4970">He was able to that through a banker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> by the name of Noah Beru (ph) who established first contacts with the German government, this is the post Nazi government saying let us try to arrange something.</sentence><sentence id="4971"><span class="BUILDING">Nahum Goldman</span> was involved very early.</sentence><sentence id="4972"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noah Beru</span> was connected to the World Jewish Congress.</sentence><sentence id="4973">Nahum Goldman was president of the World Jewish Congress, which he had created, and the very skillful negotiator and a very diplomatic person really, and the first question was: are the Germans serious?</sentence><sentence id="4974">No one trusted the Germans, but the feeling was, look, what are the options?</sentence><sentence id="4975">To let them get away with it and walk away and say nothing?</sentence><sentence id="4976">There was a Biblical phrase that was used "Thou shalt not kill the victims and steal their property and get away with it."</sentence><sentence id="4977">It was the same thing with compensation.</sentence><sentence id="4978">It was behind the restitution programs.</sentence><sentence id="4979">But compensation is something else.</sentence><sentence id="4980">Compensation is payment for individual injuries sustained.</sentence><sentence id="4981">And Adenauer, of course, had to clear with his government.</sentence><sentence id="4982">He was conservative, CDU, Conservative Democratic Union"".</sentence><sentence id="4983">The socialist were more inclined.</sentence><sentence id="4984">They themselves had been Nazi victims, many of them.</sentence><sentence id="4985">And so, the first thing that was necessary was to test their sincerity, and Goldman said look, I want to have a commitment of a minimum of a billion dollars, maybe it was a billion marks.</sentence><sentence id="4986">Goldman never knew the difference between dollars and marks.</sentence><sentence id="4987">It had to be a big figure.</sentence><sentence id="4988">If it's a billion, that's a lot.</sentence><sentence id="4989">The Germans didn't know what a billion was because they called it a <span class="BUILDING">Milliard</span>, a thousand million.</sentence><sentence id="4990">Anyway, Adenauer was able to give him assurances that after clearing with his <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> that the negotiations would be serious and eventually the agreement was reached that we would enter into negotiations.</sentence><sentence id="4991">But negotiations would have three parties.</sentence><sentence id="4992">One the German government, by that I mean the West German government.</sentence><sentence id="4993">The East German government never answered.</sentence><sentence id="4994">Communications were sent to them.</sentence><sentence id="4995">This only began after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was restored to it's (r) Correction: Christian Democratic Union.</sentence><sentence id="5002">00 sovereignty around 1951, and before then there was no government to deal with.</sentence><sentence id="5003">And the agreement was reached that negotiations would be entered into on <span class="REGION">neutral territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5004">No Jewish organization wanted to go into <span

on the other hand, the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5007">The state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at that time was a very new state.</sentence><sentence id="5008">It had a lot of enemies.</sentence><sentence id="5009">The whole <span class="REGION">Arab world</span> was aligned against it, and they need someone to represent the Jews not in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, because <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> never purported to speak for Jews who were not in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5010">And who was to speak for them?</sentence><sentence id="5011">Most of the Jews were not in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5012">They had fled.</sentence><sentence id="5013">Polish Jews, Russian Jews, German Jews, so a third party was necessary, and Goldman had the genius to put it together in what he called The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5014">It began as a Conference and then kept the name Conference.</sentence><sentence id="5015">It should have been committee or something else, but it kept the name and it consisted of a collection of the leading Jewish organizations in the world, the World Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, The American JDC, Central British Fund, The Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, The Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5016">They all came together and formed a New York corporation called The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against <span

negotiations would take place at a secret destination in a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5018">To give you some idea for the feel for it.</sentence><sentence id="5019">There was a big outcry in the Jewish community, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>: this is a betrayal of Jewish honor.</sentence><sentence id="5020">You are selling my mother.</sentence><sentence id="5021">You are trying to get money for blood.</sentence><sentence id="5022">Those who do this will be betrayed by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="5023">The only

them.</sentence><sentence id="5026">You are a betrayer of the Jewish people if you dare to sit with them.</sentence><sentence id="5027">Menachem Begin was the leader of the Irgun at the time.</sentence><sentence id="5028">They were busily engaged in smuggling Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for that.</sentence><sentence id="5029">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> had been created, and they felt very violent about that to such an extent that .</sentence><sentence id="5035">01 they did send a bomb in a <span

when the opened this big encyclopedia and the bomb exploded, it killed two policemen.</sentence><sentence id="5036">They had sent a letter bomb to the head of the German delegation.</sentence><sentence id="5037">To give you a little closer feel of what this is like, the preparations for this meeting took place at the <span class="BUILDING">Grosvenor House</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for about a week before we were going to go in, and we were then trying to prepare the opening statement.</sentence><sentence id="5038">I was there as counsel to the claims conference, because I was the director of the JRSO, so I knew about restitution.</sentence><sentence id="5039">I knew what had happened more or less and so I was an expert, so

on.</sentence><sentence id="5041">I think Hemmy Robinson (ph) and his brother Jacob Robinson were really very learned international lawyers coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, but we had a crew was working in the <span class="BUILDING">Grosvenor House</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> trying to prepare the opening statement and decide on what theory and what are we asking for, and how do you justify it.</sentence><sentence id="5042">Since my wife and I had parachuted out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> some recent time before, I was not eager to fly to wherever the meeting place was to be, and it was rumored that it was to be in <span

it's a strange way to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, but I figured as much that you know it's some other <span

and off we drove into the night.</sentence><sentence id="5052">After daylight began to break, I said to the man, "Excuse me, can you tell me who are you and where are you taking me.?"_

id="5060">Okay, fine.</sentence><sentence id="5061">Dawn was breaking, we pull in to what looks to me like an old <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5062">It was .</sentence><sentence id="5063">And it seemed to me I see SS men with police dogs there.</sentence><sentence id="5064">And then my heart just sunk into my stomach.</sentence><sentence id="5065">The Einsatzgruppen defendants had been executed not long before and I thought I had walked into a trap.</sentence><sentence id="5066">There was a Nazi on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="5067">But as I looked a little more closely, what I first glanced over SS were the Dutch Police.</sentence><sentence id="5068">They wear the same type uniform.</sentence><sentence id="5069">Black uniform without the death head and without the silver stripe on the pants.</sentence><sentence id="5070">And when I noticed that very quickly and I realized it was not a <span class="DLF">trap</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5071">But I came in, I checked in at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>; this <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> had been converted to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, a first-class <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and I was assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5072">What I was told was open no <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5073">Open no <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5074">There's a policeman

envelope.</sentence><sentence id="5077">A letter bomb envelope is an ordinary looking envelope which has a paper inside and at the bottom of it there is black powder and a detonator so when you pull it out the detonator explodes the powder and it will kill anybody who has it in their hands or anybody nearby.</sentence><sentence id="5078">That was intercepted by the Israeli police and we were told, be careful, because we knew that a member of the Stern Gang and the Irgun had entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> looking for us and was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5079">They had been tracking him.</sentence><sentence id="5080">So, it was filled with a lot of apprehension.</sentence><sentence id="5081">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> coming in from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with two Israeli delegates, crashed over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, crash landed and killed everybody on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5082">We don't know that there was any connection.</sentence><sentence id="5083">We did not have any advance notice of that, and I don't know to this day.</sentence><sentence id="5084">It may have been just an unfortunate coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="5085">I hope it was.</sentence><sentence id="5086">But it was an area of high tension.</sentence><sentence id="5087">When Goldman appeared in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Knesset</span> was stoned.</sentence><sentence id="5088">When they debated this there was people marching in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> against him trying to kill .</sentence><sentence id="5094">03 him, threatening to kill anybody who was connected with the negotiations.</sentence><sentence id="5095">So, that was the way we began.</sentence><sentence id="5096">And what we're trying to do is create a sense of justice for the injuries.</sentence><sentence id="5097">The Germans coined the term "Wiedergutmachung," which literally means make good again.</sentence><sentence id="5098">But you can't make good again, this kind of injury.</sentence><sentence id="5099">All you can do is try to ameliorate it to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="5100">And then I felt, and the others who were connected with it, was a moral obligation as well as a legal obligation.</sentence><sentence id="5101">If you injure someone, you owe them the duty of trying to make recompense as best you can and to heal them as best you can.</sentence><sentence id="5102">And that problem continues to this day: the Japanese use of comfort women and so on in other parts of the world.</sentence><sentence id="5103">It's a continuing problem, but at that time it was new.</sentence><sentence id="5104">No one had ever done this before.</sentence><sentence id="5105">No one had ever sat down after a war to provide individual compensation to the victims of not only that war, but the persecutions related to it.</sentence><sentence id="5106">And to work out the principles and to set up the machinery and to put it into legislative form so that it will be passed by a <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> and be enforced by a whole series of judicial instruments and courts and agencies on an enormous scale, I mean millions of claims, Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5107">This was not strictly a Jewish program.</sentence><sentence id="5108">No one should mistake that.</sentence><sentence id="5109">The Jews were the primary targets and certainly the worst targets, -- although the gypsies were close behind of the Nazi extermination programs -- but there were very many other victims including German victims and it would be a mistake to disregard them.</sentence><sentence id="5110">And we didn't disregard them in trying to work out the compensation laws to indemnify them for their injuries.</sentence><sentence id="5111">We never made a distinction between Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5112">They all had equal rights under the law.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5301">Q: Then what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5303">A: Well, let me give you some ideas of the legal principals involved.</sentence><sentence id="5304">First, what do you ask for?</sentence><sentence id="5305">We had global sums in mind when we negotiated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span>, and they were global .</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5311">04</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5312">sums agreed upon.</sentence><sentence id="5313">Three billion marks was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to help cover some of the costs that they had incurred in absorbing the immigrants of Nazi persecution, trying to rehabilitate them.</sentence><sentence id="5314">It was a global sum, which at that time was vital for the salvation of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5315"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had no money.</sentence><sentence id="5316"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was devastated.</sentence><sentence id="5317">How do you pay it?</sentence><sentence id="5318">It was repaid over a period of ten to twelve years.</sentence><sentence id="5319">The first payments were oil shipments.</sentence><sentence id="5320"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was at war.</sentence><sentence id="5321">What were their primary needs?</sentence><sentence id="5322">The Claims Conference was to get five hundred million dollars for compensation to the Jews outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5323">That was for organizational assistance.</sentence><sentence id="5324">Then we had, from these payments incidentally, the <span class="DLF">Israeli railroads</span> were built.</sentence><sentence id="5325">The Israeli electrical system was built in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5326">If anybody's been in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> they know that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi cabs</span> are all made by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5327">This was a great help, and it was rather ironic that the state which had set out to destroy the Jews was so helpful in fact in enabling the only Jewish state to survive.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5328">And it was so.</sentence><sentence id="5329">And people like to forget it and say no, but it's an unfair thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="5330">Then, what do you do for the individual?</sentence><sentence id="5331">How do you measure?</sentence><sentence id="5332">Well, we decided very early on, we were not going to ask anything for loss of life.</sentence><sentence id="5333">You don't take six million dollars or six billion dollars for the loss of six million lives.</sentence><sentence id="5334">But you do take the ordinary principles of law.</sentence><sentence id="5335">Ifa child lost his father, who was his provider, and the provider was a high income, middle income or low income person he'd be entitled to compensation based upon that.</sentence><sentence id="5336">But he had to prove that he had a father, and that his father was murdered by the Nazis, that the father had a certain income, that a certain portion of that income would have been used for that child, that it would have been for that child for a certain number of years, that the German government should pay for it, that they should pay for it for a limited or permanent period of time, they should pay in whole or in part or a percentage.</sentence><sentence id="5337">How much can they afford to pay?</sentence><sentence id="5338">The Leistungsfahigkeit, the ability to pay, was the theme song.</sentence><sentence id="5339">We have other obligations to pay.</sentence><sentence id="5340">So working out all these principles of law, how to measure the compensation, like an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5341">All of these things were worked out and six</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5344">It has</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="5347">the interview.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5349">Information about access and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5350">usage rights can be found in the catalog record.</sentence><sentence id="5351">05</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5352">months of detailed acrimonious negotiation to produce finally the German</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5353">Bundesentschadigungsgesetz, the law for the compensation of the Nazi victims.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="5360">06 Tape #6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5361">Q: Ben, can we talk about what sort of problems you had in with the Claims Conference in terms of was it like what happened with restitution?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5362">A: Well, the Claims Conference was the umbrella organization acting as the voice of the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="5363">Nahum Goldman had obtained authorization, in fact, to speak for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, so we had one voice speaking for the Jewish community, which was important.</sentence><sentence id="5364">The first thing I did was I set up an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span>, to serve as a <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> to watch the Germans and see that they carried out the program.</sentence><sentence id="5365">Nahum Goldman was very effective every time he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span>, which was quite regularly, he would meet with the heads of the different political patties in order assure their support.</sentence><sentence id="5366">The man that I sent to be in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> was a man who had worked for us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, a former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Berlin</span> lawyer by the name of Herbert Schoenfeld who was a bachelor and a very charming man.</sentence><sentence id="5367">And he said, "What shall I do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="5368">I took him out, he was head of the <span class="BUILDING">JRSO Stuttgart office</span> and I said "You make friends.</sentence><sentence id="5369">All you have to do is make friends."</sentence><sentence id="5370">And I gave him a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American car</span>, which cost nothing because I got it from the Army and we had free gasoline and free logistic support, and I said, "I want to know what the Germans are thinking before they think it."</sentence><sentence id="5371">And he was the man for that.</sentence><sentence id="5372">He knew all the secretaries.</sentence><sentence id="5373">He knew all the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5374">He was very popular.</sentence><sentence id="5375">The problem was to persuade the Germans to make the size of payments and category of payments that we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="5376">And the Germans didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="5377">They had their own financial problems.</sentence><sentence id="5378">The finance minister said, "Look, this will bankrupt <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5379">We can't accept these unlimited liabilities".</sentence><sentence id="5380">At one time we even talked about requiring every German to pay one mark a week or a month toward a fund so that they would realize that they were paying compensation for what had happened in their name, but .</sentence><sentence id="5386">07 that was not dealt with very seriously and it would not have been feasible.</sentence><sentence id="5387">So, the Germans undertook, with great hesitation, different categories of payments.</sentence><sentence id="5388">The German public was completely unaware.</sentence><sentence id="5389">They felt no pain whatsoever as a result of these programs.</sentence><sentence id="5390"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> prospered and the losses were much greater than anyone had anticipated.</sentence><sentence id="5391">We had made our appraisals beforehand and had estimated it would be six billion marks or nine billion marks and the Germans said oh no it's going to be 12 billion marks and we can't afford that.</sentence><sentence id="5392">By the time this program is over, it will cost the Germans well over a 100 billion marks.</sentence><sentence id="5393">They already passed the 100 billion mark figure.</sentence><sentence id="5394">That, in today's dollar, at seventy cents a mark, a hundred billion marks would be about 70 billion dollars is what it would cost the west German government, now the reunited German government, to meet these claims.</sentence><sentence id="5395">There were literally millions of claims filed.</sentence><sentence id="5396">I think it was three or four million claims, Jews and non-Jews alike.</sentence><sentence id="5397">Don't forget that these were not only Jewish claims.</sentence><sentence id="5398">And the response we had, the claims had to be proved in every case the individual claimant had to prove that he was injured as a result, direct consequence of Nazi action.</sentence><sentence id="5399">If he could prove that he was permanently disabled, he would get a lifelong pension, and they're paid now -- I don't how many are still alive, but the last time I looked at the count, a few years ago perhaps, there were over a hundred thousand Nazi victim survivors, Jewish Nazi victim survivors, who were getting life long pensions from the West German government.</sentence><sentence id="5400">Most of these people are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5401">The D-mark is very valuable currency.</sentence><sentence id="5402">The Israel currency would fluctuate.</sentence><sentence id="5403">This was a life saver for them.</sentence><sentence id="5404">In order for them to get recognition, however, they had to persuade the German doctors that the disability was caused by the persecution.</sentence><sentence id="5405">That was not easy because for years they denied that there could be any mental disability caused if it did not appear immediately on liberation.</sentence><sentence id="5406">Many people, and anybody who was in the business who knew the people knew it was so, managed to hold themselves together for many years, and then maybe five, ten, twenty years later, suddenly they would break down.</sentence><sentence id="5407">By that time, .</sentence><sentence id="5413">08 the filing deadlines had all expired; they may have been recognized for a small disability.</sentence><sentence id="5414">They had to prove that their grandfather had not had a nervous breakdown at some point.</sentence><sentence id="5415">And the German doctors were hostile.</sentence><sentence id="5416">I must say they were hostile.</sentence><sentence id="5417">And the German agencies that we had to deal with this were very often hostile.</sentence><sentence id="5418">It depended upon the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5419"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, for example, was known to be more liberal.</sentence><sentence id="5420">There was a man in charge there named Lipschitz who was very kind and tried to be fair.</sentence><sentence id="5421">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, we had nothing but troubles, tough fighting all along the way.</sentence><sentence id="5422">And this required legal services of all kinds to help the claimants.</sentence><sentence id="5423">The claimants themselves never really understood.</sentence><sentence id="5424">They said it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiedergutmachung</span>, why didn't they get more?</sentence><sentence id="5425">What they got seemed to them to be paltry, and it was in many respects.</sentence><sentence id="5426">And they couldn't understand that every case was different.</sentence><sentence id="5427">They'd say my sister got the same, and my friend, it was the exact, why did they get more than I did?</sentence><sentence id="5428">Well, there was always a reason.</sentence><sentence id="5429">Sometimes it wasn't a good reason, but to have them understand that was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="5430">So, this entire program, which expanded as we went along, it was originally intended to be over by ten years, I knew it would never be over in ten years, the laws had to be modified.</sentence><sentence id="5431">They were expanded.</sentence><sentence id="5432">Finally the Germans were getting tired of that and they called it the SchluBgesetz, the final law.</sentence><sentence id="5433">Well after they got through with the <span class="BUILDING">SchluBgesetz</span>, it wasn't <span class="BUILDING">Schlu8</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5434">They had to come with the <span class="BUILDING">hardship fund</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5435">And then after the hardship fund they came with another hardship fund because every time you started to implement the program, you discovered the loss was much greater than you anticipated, than any of us anticipated.</sentence><sentence id="5436">And since <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was prospering, and many of these payments were linked to their own civil service, so that when their own civil servants got a raise in their pensions, the Jewish Nazi victims got not the same amount, they never got the same amount, but something lesser, but they also got some raise.</sentence><sentence id="5437">And so over the years these payments were very significant.</sentence><sentence id="5438">And as I look back on it in retrospect, the program is still going on, but it should be over within the next ten, twenty years, as the last victims die off, as .</sentence><sentence id="5444">09 I look back upon it, it was a unique historical achievement, and it was a great achievement.</sentence><sentence id="5445">It was a great achievement from a moral point of view.</sentence><sentence id="5446">The awareness and recognition that the wrongdoer has an obligation to his victim to try to help him; from a legal point of view, developing the principles of compensation, the principles of law which should bind people under similar circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="5447">Which I hope are never repeated but which I fear are being repeated.</sentence><sentence id="5448">So, when you look at it as I look back upon it, I think it was a very great thing.</sentence><sentence id="5449">It was done in the name of all the Jewish organizations on behalf of the Nazi survivors.</sentence><sentence id="5450">It was inadequate to make good again any of their suffering, but at least it was a gesture that somebody cared.</sentence><sentence id="5451">They had not been forgotten.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5555">Q: Are there any particular stories involved in these claims that you might want to talk about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="5563">10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5564">A: Well, I think the fundamental story which disturbed me for many years was the German failure to recognize the Spatschaden, the late claims.</sentence><sentence id="5565">These ailments which would appear only years later, several years later, particularly mental illness, but it was not only mental.</sentence><sentence id="5566">People would suddenly get heart trouble and other things.</sentence><sentence id="5567">And the Germans refused to recognize that although medical science was beginning to recognize that people who had been subjected to trauma might have this late syndrome, which I may be a victim of myself, but they began to recognize it when the German troops began coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="5568">Suddenly they realized that these soldiers who had been subjected to the most difficult circumstances while in Soviet captivity were suffering from mental ailments of various kinds and other physical ailments and they began to compensate them.</sentence><sentence id="5569">Incidentally, the payments made to German SS officers, their pension payments were vastly higher than any amounts given to Jewish survivors.</sentence><sentence id="5570">Although they were important to the Jewish survivors, we don't want to exaggerate their importance in relationship to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s overall budget and how much they would spend on their own, their widows of their own fallen SS heroes as they considered them.</sentence><sentence id="5571">And SS officers.</sentence><sentence id="5572">And so this whole category of mental ailments was badly treated by the Germans, very badly treated for very many years, and many people died before they could get any compensation, and it had to be reversed by the <span class="BUILDING">Courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5573">And some court decisions were outrageously unfair to the claimants.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5584">Q: So, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> felt much more obligation to the perpetrators?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5586">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="5587">Well, they didn't call them perpetrators to their own fallen heroes.</sentence><sentence id="5588">But that was a different category.</sentence><sentence id="5589">This was something imposed upon them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> their normal <span class="BUILDING">judicial</span> .</sentence><sentence id="5595">11 framework and they always regarded it as such.</sentence><sentence id="5596">They always said this was "Besondere"" legislation.</sentence><sentence id="5597">This was something special and ordinary principles of law didn't apply to these payments.</sentence><sentence id="5598">This was an argument they frequently made saying look we're doing you a favor.</sentence><sentence id="5599">Get off our back.</sentence><sentence id="5600">Don't come to us with legal principle which should apply to us Germans when we have our own German law.</sentence><sentence id="5601">This is a special law and it's limited, and there are limits to what we can pay.</sentence><sentence id="5602">There was some truth in it, but and it's more than other governments have done, but this was the problems of those on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> trying to get as much as we could for the victims.</sentence><sentence id="5603">And we did that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5623">Q: Did you have help from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish organizations</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5625">A: Well, this was all done in the name of the Jewish organizations, fortunately for them for everybody I guess, they didn't have to put any money into this because we generated all the money on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, from the first payment that supported all the meetings and all the salaries and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="5626">I also managed to get tax exemptions from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for many of these expenditures.</sentence><sentence id="5627">And the organizations themselves they welcomed <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> paying of course, and were always prepared to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with the delegation and say "Pay more."</sentence><sentence id="5628">Particularly if it got in the New York Times, or even in the Jewish Week or Jewish Telegraphic Agency, but in terms of making a sacrifice, it's fortunate for the victims that the Jewish Organizations were not called upon to make sacrifices.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5633">Q: Can you tell about the establishment of the United Restitution Organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5635">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="5636">It was very obvious from the very beginning that if the Nazi victims were to assert their degdeg German: Special, extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="5643">12 claims effectively, pursuant to the German laws or the military government laws, they would need legal help.</sentence><sentence id="5644">There was no member of the <span class="BUILDING">German bar</span> who was not a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="5645">It was a requirement.</sentence><sentence id="5646">If you were not a Nazi you couldn't be admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5647">The prospect of Jewish Nazi victims going to German lawyers and paying them in an effort to get compensation, the nature of which was highly uncertain, and the value of which was highly uncertain was not something that they would do.</sentence><sentence id="5648">If there were no agency to assist them with their claims, the whole legislative programs that we worked out would be meaningless.</sentence><sentence id="5649">And so, we set up, by we, I mean again I was the director the JDC was the leading body, there had been a small organization of German Jewish lawyers who had fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and set themselves up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they were handling some restitution claims for the return of property.</sentence><sentence id="5650">They were being supported by the JDC and the Central British Fund and I think the Jewish Agency.</sentence><sentence id="5651">Very small payments and a very small program.</sentence><sentence id="5652">And when I set up the program, I incorporated them.</sentence><sentence id="5653">They were called the <span

was a very fine gentleman by the name of Professor Norman Bentwich, a distinguished Englishman, a dear friend, an outstanding citizen.</sentence><sentence id="5656">And then I expanded it with money that the Germans had paid.</sentence><sentence id="5657">I borrowed from the Claims Conference a few million dollars and expanded that operation.</sentence><sentence id="5658">The Claims Conference got the money from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="5659">I repaid it to the Claims Conference later and expanded the organization so that when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1956,

class="BUILDING">Offices</span> in every major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, wherever there was large concentrations of Jews who needed help with their claims, the <span class="BUILDING">United Restitution Office</span> set up an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5661">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we had one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> and in

class="BUILDING">offices</span> all around the world.</sentence><sentence id="5671">And these <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were there to give assistance to claimants with no down payment a small contingent fee which enabled the organization to maintain itself funneling hundreds of thousands of claims through to the German agencies and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we had <span

with lawyers of our own choice.</sentence><sentence id="5672">The heads of <span class="BUILDING">office</span> were always Jewish lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="5673">We didn't rely on German lawyers except as subsidiary staff and then we screened them.</sentence><sentence id="5674">So, this was a very big operation, largely unheard of.</sentence><sentence id="5675">It worked very well, I must say.</sentence><sentence id="5676">I set it up around 1951 and I resigned from that in 1992 or 1993 after about 40 years.</sentence><sentence id="5677">In all that time, we dealt with hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands and thousands of claims there was never a trace of any scandal of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="5678">Not a single client was able to demonstrate -- a few did complain they didn't get enough, but malpractice.</sentence><sentence id="5679">We had no malpractice insurance, and we never had any indication of anything other than a clean and upright organization which did not satisfy all the clients.</sentence><sentence id="5680">Most of them felt they didn't get enough, but some of them did.</sentence><sentence id="5681">They appreciated it.</sentence><sentence id="5682">And it was also a very unique type of operation.</sentence><sentence id="5683">There was no doubt the biggest legal aid society that ever existed.</sentence><sentence id="5684">Now, they're down to maybe 100 people all together.</sentence><sentence id="5685">Their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> are still in <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5749">A: Well, the usual bureaucratic problems.</sentence><sentence id="5750">There was initially some conflict, I would say .</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5756">14 conflict is perhaps too strong, some difference in emphasis on the German Jews and the non- German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5757">For a while the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was divided.</sentence><sentence id="5758">The German Jews had their type of claim and the non-German Jews, Polish Jews primarily had their type of claim, and they tried to run them in separate departments.</sentence><sentence id="5759">I refused that.</sentence><sentence id="5760">I had the same in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5761">They were on different <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5762">I said no.</sentence><sentence id="5763">It's one organization.</sentence><sentence id="5764">They are all Nazi victims.</sentence><sentence id="5765">They are all Jews.</sentence><sentence id="5766">They'll be treated all the same.</sentence><sentence id="5767">No segregation whatsoever.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5768">And that dichotomy didn't last long.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="5775">15 Tape #7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5776">Q: Ben, what happened to that original debt?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5777">A: The million marks that I borrowed from the Occupation Funds on authorization of General Clay?</sentence><sentence id="5778">Well, as I told you, I had signed a document promising to repay it out of restitutions monies when the monies came in.</sentence><sentence id="5779">It seemed like a fair enough arrangement to avoid having to get consent from the Russians and the British and the French.</sentence><sentence id="5780">When the money was gone, Mr. Clay was also gone, General Clay was also gone, and Mr. McCloy was in his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5781">So, I went to see High Commissioner John McCloy.</sentence><sentence id="5782">I explained to him, being an honest man, that I had borrowed this million marks against occupation funds, and that I promised to repay, but I said, "Look, the money is just beginning to come in.</sentence><sentence id="5783">There are other priorities.</sentence><sentence id="5784">I'm trying to move the D.P.s out of the camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5785">In order to do that I need the money to buy prefabricated <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which can be shipped from, at that time everything was under strict control, export import controls and I said I need the funds to buy these prefabricated <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to ship them in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5786">Otherwise we're going to have the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> blocked and all the rest."</sentence><sentence id="5787">He said, "All right, all right."

100.</sentence><sentence id="5994">A thousand, 1,200, 1,500 they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5995">All the medical experiment victims came and the Red Cross said that was the deal, and they kept on approving them and they kept on getting paid.</sentence><sentence id="5996">And the minimum payment, I figured out, I arranged that the payments would be made in Swiss franks as well, so it didn't get worthless zloty and the people could go abroad in order to get medical treatment.</sentence><sentence id="5997">They could spend their money abroad.</sentence><sentence id="5998">And the minimum payment was what a college professor in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would have earned in two years time.</sentence><sentence id="5999">So, it was a great thing for these Polish women, and one of my most touching moments in my whole experience in this business was a group of them waiting at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to greet me when I came as a guest as the Polish government to express their appreciation for my effort.</sentence><sentence id="6000">So, that was one of the categories of claims outside of the normal range, and there were many others.</sentence><sentence id="6001">The slave labor claims I dealt with in detail in my book Less Than Slaves, which unfortunately is out of print now.</sentence><sentence id="6002">I hope that <span class="BUILDING">Harvard University</span> will be induced by the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> to print in paperback again, that book which has many useful lessons.</sentence><sentence id="6003">It's been translated into German.</sentence><sentence id="6004">It's been translated into Japanese.</sentence><sentence id="6005">It's been the basis of a good television show, and I would hope that something could be done.</sentence><sentence id="6006">There are many others if you shake my memory a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="6007">And another one comes to mind as we talk.</sentence><sentence id="6008">And that's payments for the rabbis.</sentence><sentence id="6009">I see you raise your eyebrows.</sentence><sentence id="6010">I see you never heard of this.</sentence><sentence id="6017">21 Nobody every heard of it, but we asserted a claim, during the Hague negotiations for payment to all the officials of the Jewish congregations.</sentence><sentence id="6018">As I indicated <span class="BUILDING">Jewish congregations</span> were state organizations.</sentence><sentence id="6019">They were entities of the state, and if a school teacher, an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> lost his job or stayed long enough, he got a pension.</sentence><sentence id="6020">If he was a teacher in a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, he should have been entitled to the same pension.</sentence><sentence id="6021">But the Germans said, no, no, no we can't do that because we don't know who would have been entitled to a pension.</sentence><sentence id="6022">How should we know now?</sentence><sentence id="6023">All the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closing in 1933 and whether the Rabbi or the , or the moyl or the ritual all the people who are involved in Jewish congregation and religious life, whether they would be eligible for pension, we can't know that.</sentence><sentence id="6024">So, I countered.</sentence><sentence id="6025">I said, let's make a global settlement for I think it was 30 million marks and then we'll distribute.</sentence><sentence id="6026">Oh no, we can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="6027">I said, all right we'll make another deal.</sentence><sentence id="6028">We will set up an advisory committee to check the claims first and only when we check it and say that it's okay will we pass it on to you, and you can check it again if you like and we will only approve those cases where we think the man would be entitled to a pension.</sentence><sentence id="6029">They bought that, much to my relief, much to their regret.</sentence><sentence id="6030">Because we then set up small advisory committee of former German Jews mostly, I was the Chairman of that committee, and we received of thousands and thousands of applications of people who would have been qualified or felt they would have been qualified for a pension from these Jewish congregations.</sentence><sentence id="6031">And we approved those cases and we passed them on to the Germans and the Germans paid.</sentence><sentence id="6032">It was not under the Finance Ministry but under their Social Ministry.</sentence><sentence id="6033">The Ministry which deals with this type of problem.</sentence><sentence id="6034">I say partly to our shame, there were many cases where we turned down the claim, and they could appeal to the Germans and the Germans approved it, so that although we were correct in our determination of eligibility, there were cases where the Germans felt well, we had turned it down, but the man would have been entitled.</sentence><sentence id="6035">For example, a typical type of case would be a rabbi left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, fled .</sentence><sentence id="6041">22 in 1935, was able to get out.</sentence><sentence id="6042">Somebody else took his <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6043">He stayed until 1938 or "37, they closed it down.</sentence><sentence id="6044">He worked for two years.</sentence><sentence id="6045">Was he a career employee of the congregation so that he would have been entitled to the pension, or was he only a temporary employee?</sentence><sentence id="6046">Some of the members of my advisory board said, no, no, under no circumstances he should never expected a pension.</sentence><sentence id="6047">It was only a temporary thing.</sentence><sentence id="6048">I always voted in favor of the claimant where the matter was in doubt.</sentence><sentence id="6049">If it was a tie vote, I think we were five, if it was two and two, I always cast in favor of the Claimant.</sentence><sentence id="6050">But many cases we turned down and the Germans said yes, we'll pay them.</sentence><sentence id="6051">So that's an example of Jews being overly cautious and the Germans being a bit more generous in a completely different category of case outside the normal range of the law, and of course, it cost the Germans very much more than we had originally anticipated in the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6257">Q: Ben, can you talk a little bit about the attitude of the German industrialists when you started making claims for slave laborers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6259">A: The German industrialists had a rather unique attitude.</sentence><sentence id="6260">They began by denying that it ever happened.</sentence><sentence id="6261">The attitude was "What?</sentence><sentence id="6262">We employed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates?"</sentence><sentence id="6263">Next, they denied that they were in any way responsible or connected with it. "</sentence><sentence id="6264">Ah, perhaps they were assigned to us by the SS.</sentence><sentence id="6265">It could have been, but the conditions were really very good."</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6266">So they denied the conditions.</sentence><sentence id="6267">Then when you pointed out the conditions were really very terrible. "</sentence><sentence id="6268">Ah, we were not responsible for that.</sentence><sentence id="6269">We did the best we could under difficult circumstances."</sentence><sentence id="6270">Then the ultimate payoff was "Well, you know, if it hadn't been for us, they would have gone directly into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6271">So, by our providing work, we saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="6272">Why are they complaining to us?</sentence><sentence id="6273">They owe us."</sentence><sentence id="6274">That essentially in summary was the attitude of all the industrialist without exception, despite all the denials since that time which have appeared on television and on radio shows and on all kinds of other shows and it was the universal response of all of them, without exception.</sentence><sentence id="6275">Now, I had a little incident, my knowledge of what had happened came largely from the Nuremberg Trials against I.G.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6276">Farben which built <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, against Krupp, a big user of slave labor, against Flick, who was a big industrialist who had many companies using slave labor, armaments firms and everything else, automobile companies; and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> we had collected the documentary evidence of this and the documentary evidence showed what the truth was.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6277">How many people they employed, where they employed them, what the conditions were, how much they paid the SS for the laborers, it was a few Pfennigs, and what they had to do in order to qualify to receive inmates.</sentence><sentence id="6278">And they showed very clearly to me that you had to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="6285">24</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6286">have good connections with the SS.</sentence><sentence id="6287">You had to be engaged in industry which they considered important, you had to be sure to provide security either by sending your own people to be trained as SS guards, by the SS to put barbed wire all around the particular plant wherever they were working.</sentence><sentence id="6288">Post the proper security guards and other security measures to be able to maintain them on the level which was tolerable to the SS, which means minimum consumption, maximum production.</sentence><sentence id="6289">Failure to do that is the equivalent of being shot dead or treated as a saboteur.</sentence><sentence id="6290">So, they had to comply with all that before they could even be considered for getting labor.</sentence><sentence id="6291">I'm not talking about right after the beginning of the war and people were seized on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and put to work on rubble.</sentence><sentence id="6292">I'm talking about regular forced slave laborers.</sentence><sentence id="6293">And I had all the documentary proof including the decrees from Albert Speer, who was the Minister responsible for the armaments industry and for the allocation of labor.</sentence><sentence id="6294">And the industrialist with whom I had met -- I.G.

else.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6486">Very little Jewish concern.</sentence><sentence id="6487">So I began to work on an <span class="BUILDING">International Criminal Court</span>, and the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> was already working on that problem, ever since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, but had made no progress.</sentence><sentence id="6488">And they made no progress because the Nations didn't want it.</sentence><sentence id="6489">And they said until they had a definition of Aggression there was no use in having a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> because Aggression is the biggest of all crimes.</sentence><sentence id="6490">And that they had been fooling around with the definition of aggression for 30 or 40 years with no progress so I decided to work on a definition of Aggression first to get that out of the way.</sentence><sentence id="6491">Where we go from there is another story.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="6498">31 Tape #9</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6499">A: It seemed to me to be a bit absurd that the International Legal community was unable to define Aggression.</sentence><sentence id="6500">I began to work on that problem.</sentence><sentence id="6501">When I work on any <span class="NPIP">problem</span>, I do it the same way.</sentence><sentence id="6502">I begin from the beginning of time and read and study everything that has ever been written or said, and I began to lobby at the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> where there was a special committee appointed to define Aggression and was going nowhere, and I got access, I obtained a pass to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6503">I obtained several passes of various kinds and was able to go to all of the meetings.</sentence><sentence id="6504">And I met with the delegates and I presented papers for them and I coached them and I spoke with them and I lobbied with them and I wrote articles in all law reviews and things of that kind.</sentence><sentence id="6505">To make a long story short, they finally agreed on a consensus definition of Aggression.</sentence><sentence id="6506">An interesting sidenote, I knew it was coming it was a Good Friday, it was 1974, I think, and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said to Gertrude, tomorrow you come with me to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6507">They're going to reach a consensus definition of Aggression for the first time in 50 years.</sentence><sentence id="6508">It will be the legal committee, the Sixth Committee of the United Nations Special Committee on Aggression.</sentence><sentence id="6509">And I took her there and sure enough a few minutes had come and it had already been prepared and we vote upon a consensus definition of Aggression.</sentence><sentence id="6510">I said "Look around you."</sentence><sentence id="6511">We're in one of these big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6512">Nobody was there.</sentence><sentence id="6513">It was in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="6514">The two of us were sitting in the rear section of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span>, and I said, "You see, this entire <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> the only two people who are not paid to be here are you and me", and it was a historic occasion.</sentence><sentence id="6515">And I immediately a two volume book on the definition of Aggression which spelled out the background of all of this and this became a classic work on the definition of Aggression.</sentence><sentence id="6516">Then I said, now we can go on to the <span class="BUILDING">International Criminal Court</span> and that obstacle had been gotten out of the way and they began to work on a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and they were getting absolutely nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="6517">And again, I .</sentence><sentence id="6523">32 did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="6524">I wrote a two-volume book on an <span class="BUILDING">international criminal court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6525">This laid out the history, the documents, the background the argumentation for it, how you can create such a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="6526">That book came out in 1975, right after the definition and nobody read the book.</sentence><sentence id="6527">Nobody paid any attention to the book.</sentence><sentence id="6528">Well, all right, I tell them how to do it they're not interested.</sentence><sentence id="6529">How do you enforce international law?</sentence><sentence id="6530">So, I wrote a two volume book on that and somebody said, "Why do you keep writing books in two volumes?"</sentence><sentence id="6531">And I said, "Because my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> is so high I need something to sit on and I need two volumes."</sentence><sentence id="6532">And of course that was only a joke.</sentence><sentence id="6533">It was in fact all the documentation, all the history, everything was there.</sentence><sentence id="6534">Going back to ancient days, and it was a very useful took and that was what it was intended to be.</sentence><sentence id="6535">It was my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">notebooks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6536">And when I got through with that, still nobody was paying attention.</sentence><sentence id="6537">I wrote another book Common Sense Guide to World Peace.</sentence><sentence id="6538">I wrote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Planethood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6539">I wrote another book -- I called in the Russians and compared notes with some Russian experts and I kept writing books and articles and going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and going to all these meetings, keeping abreast of what was going on, trying to influence it, and nothing much was happening.</sentence><sentence id="6540">And crimes were being committed everywhere and sometimes I thought I had gotten the governments moving in <span class="COUNTRY">Bangladesh</span> when thousands of women were being raped, they said they were going to set up a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and I was advising them on that.</sentence><sentence id="6541">They didn't pay me for it, but I was advising them for it, and then in the end they said let's have reconciliation and forget it.</sentence><sentence id="6542">And of course the crimes continued.</sentence><sentence id="6543">Then something very interesting happened.</sentence><sentence id="6544">In <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, there we had genocide all over again.</sentence><sentence id="6545">Before that, we had Saddam Hussien, a clear case of aggression, a clear case of all kinds of war crimes, a clear case including rape, pillage, murder, environmental depredations, which had not been listed as a crime before, but all kinds of things and the international community did nothing.</sentence><sentence id="6546">They chased him out but as far as Saddam Hussein was concerned, they allowed him to remain.</sentence><sentence id="6547">And I was screaming bloody .</sentence><sentence id="6553">33 murder everywhere saying you are encouraging more criminality.</sentence><sentence id="6554">You have betrayed half a million young American people who risked their lives to go out into that <span class="DLF">desert</span> and then you didn't have the courage to follow through and do what was needed to be done in order to create a more peaceful world or order by punishing those who are responsible for the crimes.</sentence><sentence id="6555">Instead you're punishing innocent civilian population.</sentence><sentence id="6556">Your sanctions starve them.</sentence><sentence id="6557">He doesn't go hungry.</sentence><sentence id="6558">And I began to scream and television and radio and every <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could go.</sentence><sentence id="6559">Not many, because most people are not interested.</sentence><sentence id="6560">They're interested in scandal and things of that kind: rock stars, football players.</sentence><sentence id="6561">They're not interested in scholars.</sentence><sentence id="6562">However, along came <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> where genocide now called ethnic cleansing got very popular and mass rapes got very popular and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> said we can't get involved.</sentence><sentence id="6563">Our fingers were burned in <span class="COUNTRY">Somalia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6564">We don't want to do what we did in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6565">The United States government was opposed to an <span class="BUILDING">International Court</span> was opposed to doing anything, but because of this medium because of television and the opportunity of the public to see people get on television and say as I heard one man say, a Serbian soldier, he said: "Yes, I've raped dozens of Muslim women, but then I cut their throats because that's what my commander told me to do."</sentence><sentence id="6566">And the women of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, God bless them, began to scream "Do something."</sentence><sentence id="6567">And the U.S. Government for the first time said we have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="6568">What can we do?</sentence><sentence id="6569">The <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>, let's set up a <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6570">We're not going to send troops.</sentence><sentence id="6571">Let's set up a <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6572">So they set up a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6573">All crimes in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, limited to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and limited to after 1991, which is of course preposterous.</sentence><sentence id="6574">It so happened, that when the General Assembly approved the draft statute for that <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at a meeting of the International Law Commission.</sentence><sentence id="6575">I'm not a member of that Commission.</sentence><sentence id="6576">I was there doing my usual type of lobbying.</sentence><sentence id="6577">But a proud moment was when the statute came through on the fax in their big things, one of the staff members brought it to me and said "Here, this is your work."</sentence><sentence id="6578">So, there are times when there is progress made.</sentence><sentence id="6579">It may take a .</sentence><sentence id="6585">34 long time and it may be slow progress, and it is slow progress, and it's ridiculous to have a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> limited jurisdiction for a limited period of time.</sentence><sentence id="6586">We need a permanent <span class="BUILDING">international criminal court</span>, and I'm still working on that, because there's this big gap in the international legal order.</sentence><sentence id="6587">My latest book, New Legal Foundations for Global Survival: Security Through the Security Council, is a comprehensive bringing together of twenty years of careful thought and I share that with the public.</sentence><sentence id="6588">All of my royalties I have given away to peace groups.</sentence><sentence id="6589">I will not make a penny on that book any more than we did with the book "Planethood" which was written with Ken Keyes, who incidentally is a quadriplegic and totally ignores it.</sentence><sentence id="6590">No penny for him and not a penny for me.</sentence><sentence id="6591">That book is out to educate the public on the need for planetary thinking, if we're going to have a peaceful world.</sentence><sentence id="6592">There will be no peace for anyone, anywhere until there it peace everywhere and that is my conviction and in this last book I tried to lay out the blue print specifically including the security council resolutions that are needed in order to achieve that goal.</sentence><sentence id="6593">And it is feasible.</sentence><sentence id="6594">And it's feasible without amending the U.N. Charter, and I'm afraid to tear up the U.N. Charter and start again, because I see the anarchy that comes in places like the former Soviet Union and <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and it's too dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="6595">Too many people will die before we can pull the thing together again.</sentence><sentence id="6596">So, I'm ready to try to make it work within its existing framework by interpreting the laws and by laying out new rules to make the Security Council a more democratic and fairer institution than it is today, and that is the gist of my thinking and of my new book.</sentence><sentence id="6597">And now that I am approaching the age of 75, I hope the time will come for me to close my book and say this is my effort to create a more humane and more peaceful world so all may live in peace and dignity.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6751">Q: Ben, I wonder if you could read a short excerpt from one of the letters that you wrote Gertrude, your wife, when you were on the War Crimes investigating teams.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6753">A: I have one here.</sentence><sentence id="6754">It's interesting that my wife Gertrude, who was then not my wife, she was only my can't say girlfriend, I don't know what the appropriate term.</sentence><sentence id="6755">She was my sweetheart, my darling, it says here.</sentence><sentence id="6756">She saved all the letters that I wrote from the front, including the scene in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> as I came in, many of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6757">And of all of these letters were saved, they're over 50 years old, in their original envelopes.</sentence><sentence id="6758">At that time you were not allowed to write where you were.</sentence><sentence id="6759">You were not allowed to describe, and I had smuggled these out by some means which I don't even remember anymore, but I was probably giving it to some officer who was going to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to put it in a <span class="DLF">mailbox</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="6760">So she has them with the envelopes with the stamps on them, and all of these that relate to the Holocaust have been given to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6761">They can be found there in more detail.</sentence><sentence id="6762">But here's one which I think is reasonable typical.</sentence><sentence id="6763">It's only the covering note of a very much longer report.</sentence><sentence id="6764">I don't know how many pages the long report is, but more detail and I say here this is a case I wrote about long ago.</sentence><sentence id="6765">This is dated June 14, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="6766">I must have written about in May while the war was still on.

Just in case you can't find that other more detailed letter, these murdered men were political prisoners of every nationality and were murdered simply because they appeared to be too tired to continue the march successfully.</sentence><sentence id="6791">The SS beasts didn't even wait for these men to fall, they just marched them into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for slaughter."</sentence><sentence id="6792">These were non-Jews, Jews of course were included as well.</sentence><sentence id="6793">So, on that happy note, I thank you for the opportunity to record this piece of history and we hope the next world will be a better one.</sentence><sentence id="6794">I thank you all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
