Sprecher.</sentence><sentence id="10">I was a prosecutor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and I've been writing a book on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> called, "Inside the Nuremberg Trial, A Prosecutor's Comprehensive Account."</sentence><sentence id="11">I've been working on it for nearly 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="12">It'll be published in late November or December of this year, by the University Press of America.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: I wonder if you'd talk next about your motivations in becoming a Nuremberg prosecutor?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="20">I'd been with -- ""d written a senior paper during my last year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, concerning the structure of national socialism, as we knew it at that time.</sentence><sentence id="21">And I read a few books, particularly by professors from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">And the book got a triple A, or the article got a tripi A -- triple A rating, and so I had an early interest USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 3 in the Nazi regime, way back in 1933 and "34.</sentence><sentence id="23">Then I went off to the London School of Economics for a year and there were a number of refugees there, refugees from Hitler, who -- with whom I became friends and went out to dinner with and parties and so on.</sentence><sentence id="24">So I got to form some friendships that way.</sentence><sentence id="25">Then, of course, came the war and I was overseas for nearly [phone ringing].</sentence><sentence id="26">Well, what was I saying?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Oh you'd -- were at the London School of Economics.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Oh, and I -- as I di -- was about to say, I traveled around Europe a bit and twice into Nazi Germany.</sentence><sentence id="40">I saw the wedding of Herman Goering and Emma Sonamen on April 10, 1935.</sentence><sentence id="41">I traveled into the -- the ruhr, because I'd met a German young man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, who offered to show me the good hoffnoseeter and to stay overnight in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="42">He did this knowing that I was anti-Nazi, but his family was rather re-reserved, because I don't think they wanted to -- they didn't want to take a chance of exposing themselves too much.</sentence><sentence id="43">Anyway, I also went out one evening with -- somewhere near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, with the Reverend Stuart Herman, H-e-r-m-a-n, who later became the American pastor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">He ra -- He later wrote the book, "It's Your Souls We Want."</sentence><sentence id="45">And Stu Herman and I became lifelong friends, we're still corresponding.</sentence><sentence id="46">After I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span> for three years and my club won the moot court arguments, and the case was based on a -- a -- a labor case.</sentence><sentence id="47">So when I went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, I went to the Labor Board and they hired me in a half an hour, based on the fact that I'd contributed to this brief, which was on a point that was being argued before the</sentence><sentence id="49"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 4 <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">So that started four years of trial work.</sentence><sentence id="51">They used me as a trial lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="52">Then came the war and in 1942, I enlisted and within a month was again back in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, as a sergeant and later a warrant officer.</sentence><sentence id="53">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for six months until the -- after the invasion of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> by the allies.</sentence><sentence id="54">I then went to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span>, as administrative officer to the Inspector General.</sentence><sentence id="55">In that capacity we traveled all over <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>, inspecting <span class="BUILDING">American army installations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">I then -- An old friend of mine, Gerhard VanArkel, who was the deputy head of the German labor branch of the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> and asked me to come up and become the training officer for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">labor desk</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">I had a hard time getting away from my boss, but I finally managed and for some six months I trained Germans who had fought on the -- for the Loyalists in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">And th-these anti-Nazi Germans were being trained to do parachute jumping, to do signals -- signal work so they could send out messages after they'd jumped into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="59">Then I got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to come and become the training officer at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">central desk</span> of OSS -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">central desk</span> for labor and German operatives.</sentence><sentence id="60">And while I was there, Jack Ohly, O-h- l-y, whom I'd known in <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span>, saw me with my parachute wings and said, "You ha -- should come to work for the labor branch, helping us settle strikes and gathering labor for the short supply labor industries in the midwest."</sentence><sentence id="61">And I said, "I don't think the OSS will release me."</sentence><sentence id="62">His boss was Colonel Brennan, who later became a Supreme Court Justice.</sentence><sentence id="63">Colonel Brennan called Arthur Goldberg, who was my top boss and later a member of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> and convinced him that I should</sentence><sentence id="65"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 5 perform this service.</sentence><sentence id="66">So, while that went on, the war finally came to an end and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with the idea of getting out of the army and returning to trial law for the labor board.</sentence><sentence id="67">At that time, s -- r -- Justice Robert H. Jackson had been appointed to be the US Chief of Council for war crimes.</sentence><sentence id="68">He made a statement which was released to the press on June second, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="69">I was so struck by it's -- not only it's understanding of the w -- the way Hitler had come to power, but of it's determination to see that the Nazi regime was exposed from beginning to end that it's top leaders were brought to justice and to an explanation of why they had committed the evils they had committed.</sentence><sentence id="70">I didn't know how to get with Justice Jackson's group, because I didn't know him at the time.</sentence><sentence id="71">So I went back to OSS and my old fraternity brother, Robert Thrun, T-h-r-u-n, was one of the three assistants to Wild Bill Donovan, the head of OSS.</sentence><sentence id="72">General Wild Bill Donovan.</sentence><sentence id="73">And I had told him my dilemma, and he says, "Well, we can take care of that."</sentence><sentence id="74">So we went down to see the general council of OSS, who is another Donovan, a James Donovan.</sentence><sentence id="75">And Jim Donovan hired me within a half hour and for the next month or so, I busily engaged in studying in detail, the OSS reports on Nazi Germany, and they were terrific and very well done.</sentence><sentence id="76">And a professor by the name of Noiman had written a book on Nazi Germany -- just a second -- Noiman had written a book called, "Behemoth" and I studied that in some detail and then went in to see him.</sentence><sentence id="77">And I told him of my background and he said, "Well, I -- Of course you're interested in the destruction of the trade unions by the Nazis."</sentence><sentence id="78">And I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="79">He reached back and pulled out a German book that had been obtained by</sentence><sentence id="81"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 6 OSS through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">And, an appendix in that German book contained the order of Robert Ley, L-e-y, the later defendant at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> who committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="83">And Robert Ley had written this order on how the SA -- the Storm Troopers and the SS were to take over the trade unions.</sentence><sentence id="84">Well, this gave me the basis for not only a brief and for a -- an eventual presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>, it also gave me leads to labor leader with whom OSS was in touch, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and some of them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">So I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then went into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit some of these trade union leaders.</sentence><sentence id="86">And I got affidavits from all of them and those affidavits were all introduced in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- first Nuremberg trial.</sentence><sentence id="87">Neither one of the affiants was cross- examined by the defense, they didn't question at all the -- the horrors that surrounded that particular aspect of the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="88">The result was that that made some impression on Justice Jackson and later on others and the main deputy to Jackson, Colonel Robert G. Storey, who later became head of the American Bar Association, he was quite impressed by this work and said, ""You must make some -- a presentation to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>," which of course delighted me.</sentence><sentence id="89">And he assigned me the case of a Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader, who later became the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Let me interrupt to ask a question.</sentence><sentence id="146">Do you think that had you not sort of pushed yourself forward, you would ever have been approached to play a role?</sentence><sentence id="147">You s -- You were peculiarly fitted, I think, but I wondered if it's because you were aware of that fit and felt at once, very strongly, that this was something you wanted to be involved in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="154"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Yes, as soon as I heard Justice Jack -- read Justice Jackson's report, I knew there was where Sprecher should next go.</sentence><sentence id="156">And so I'd determined to get there one way or the other, and it turned out to be a relatively easy <span class="DLF">path</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Lalso want to go back to what we talked about before, really, your motivations, but in becoming involved, did you feel that you had something personal you wanted to achieve?</sentence><sentence id="160">I don't mean for the sake of your personal ego or career, but did you feel passionately about what this prosecution was going to achieve?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: I felt passionately about what the prosecution could achieve.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: And then, what did -- what do you feel the Nuremberg trial -- what do you feel the effect was on you later?</sentence><sentence id="166">The -- Y-Your own writings bear testimony to what happened, but if we move forward, how do you look back on it and do you feel that it's been evolving over many years, the impact?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: The impact of the Nuremberg trial on American public opinion was considerable for approximately one year.</sentence><sentence id="170">And then, with the coming of the -- after the war, with the coming of the Cold War, American opinion and the journalists and so on, turned very rapidly toward discussions of the Cold War and the Nazis and the Nuremberg trials were very much played down and not talked up for some time.</sentence><sentence id="171">I turned away to other things here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and then got involved in some business affairs and then got into Behavioral Science and teaching at <span class="BUILDING">George Washington University</span> in Behavioral Science, which is a new <span class="DLF">field</span> for me, but I really worked hard to get there and a couple of professors were kind of pushing me to do that.</sentence><sentence id="172">And then I began to get interested in</sentence><sentence id="174"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 8 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> again, particularly after I th -- more or less retired, although I -- I didn't completely retire from training and consulting.</sentence><sentence id="175">But I slowed down a lot and I started to first work on Baldur von Schirach, the usel -- the youth leader, who -- wh-whom I had particularly prosecuted, I'd made the principal presentation against him.</sentence><sentence id="176">Then I decided I'd switch to something which was talked more about and that was Julius Streicher, the top Jew baiter of all time.</sentence><sentence id="177">But then, a lot was written about him, and so I started to move toward the idea of seeing if I couldn't contribute something different by writing the most elaborate book, the most comprehensive book on the Nuremberg trials, one which would agree with most of the conclusions that many other writers have made, but which would go beyond that, into the depth of the evidence, and particularly quotations from the contemporaneous documents and from the testimony of the 20 -- of the 22 defendants who were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- 21 defendants.</sentence><sentence id="178">The consequence was that I finally developed a huge book, far too long for publication.</sentence><sentence id="179">It was rejected by a number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commercial presses</span> as being financially unbearable with it's length, and I think it was, especially for a commercial press.</sentence><sentence id="180">I then started approaching <span class="BUILDING">university presses</span> and they all insisted that the book should be reduced somewhat in size, so it'd fit into two volumes, rather than three.</sentence><sentence id="181">And so I spent a couple of years doing the difficult task of condensing.</sentence><sentence id="182">And finally, the university press of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, based on all the commendations that I had and their own scholarly research, decided that the book did have a special role to play and so I'm -- was very</sentence><sentence id="184"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 9 glad to sign a contract with them and my book will be published in late December -- or late No-November or early December.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: And of course the length publishers want has nothing to do with the value of something to posterity.</sentence><sentence id="205">You know, your material and work is there to be handed on, in full length.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Yes, that's what distinguishes the book mainly.</sentence><sentence id="209">I don't attempt to be the final preacher about the Nazi regime, but I mean to make the account of the trial available, so that many scholars and a lot of others that are r-really interested and willing to spend some time, can really delve into the contemporaneous documents and particularly into the motivations of the defendants.</sentence><sentence id="210">It's so false for people to think of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in terms of defendants saying, "I was following superior orders."</sentence><sentence id="211">These defendants worked for years for the Nazis and superior orders defense applies mainly to lower people in the -- at the bottom of the hierarchy, who are told to go and shoot somebody or to commit some atrocious crime.</sentence><sentence id="212">The people at the top give their loyalties to a regime over a period of time, and they do it for many different reasons.</sentence><sentence id="213">It has little to do with, I was ordered to do this by somebody.</sentence><sentence id="214">Most of the enthusiastically worked for the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="215">Some of them, of course, had great reservations and some of them wept as they gave their testimony, being very sorry indeed, for having associated themselves with such an evil course of conduct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: When you talked of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and the fact that it was only for a year that it was extensively covered in the American press, | -- I'd like you to say more about that,</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="230">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 10 because I'm sure you feel that the very holding of the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> was immensely important in documenting what had gone on.</sentence><sentence id="231">I -- I was just reading about Benjamin Firense a-as just one small example of somebody gathering evidence.</sentence><sentence id="232">But I'm sure we gained immensely through -- in many ways, through holding the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Yes, Professor Firense came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and when he find -- found out about the Einsatzgruppen, he immediately started to make some proposals to General Telford Taylor about his leading that -- the case against the main leaders of the Einsatzgruppen, the special task forces which killed millions -- a couple million Jews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="234">And he did this with great ability and aplomb and he presented the case almost entirely with documents in an -- less than a day and one half.</sentence><sentence id="235">The case went on for months after that, by the defense, but the prosecutions case, in the shortest Nuremberg case of all -- the short -- the shortest case of the prosecution, was the one conducted by Firense.</sentence><sentence id="236">I became the head of several divisions, the subsequent proceedings division, economics division, chief of the I. G. Farben trial team, and later, deputy chief council in charge of the official publications.</sentence><sentence id="237">At -- Firense had been offered the job, by Telford Taylor, of being director of publications.</sentence><sentence id="238">He turned it down in order to become head of the Jewish successor restitution organization and he recovered from German firms tha -- who had employed slave labor and who'd taken property from Jews, he recovered vast quantities of money for the people involved at -- the survivors of the -- of the people that were involved or the -- some of the people who still survived.</sentence><sentence id="239">And to this day, he's one of my best friends.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="243"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What -- You're in touch with a number of people whose experience was somewhat simu -- similar.</sentence><sentence id="245">You mentioned for instance, a -- as a good friend.</sentence><sentence id="246">Have you talked with these colleagues about the impact or the effect of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> on your lives, and is there any similarity, sort of commonality of experience?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: [I've talked to almost all the survivors, in fact, I was the chairman of the executive committee that put on three Nuremberg reunions, beginning in 1979, nine -- then another 1991 and one in 1996 at the -- more or less at the 50th anniversary of the end of the first Nuremberg trial.</sentence><sentence id="248">And I'm in touch with almost all these prosecutors.</sentence><sentence id="249">I've sent them chapters from my forthcoming book.</sentence><sentence id="250">I've asked for their criticisms and their comments.</sentence><sentence id="251">I don't think anybody surviving knows as much about the people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> than -- than I do.</sentence><sentence id="252">I don't think so, because of my continued work on this subject.</sentence><sentence id="253">I have constantly wanted to be in touch with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: And what do you think the impact has been?</sentence><sentence id="262">Has it colored everything that you" ve done subsequently?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Oh yes, I -- You don't do anything as significant as the Nuremberg trial was, in reviewing a modern dictatorship, without that having a tremendous effect emotionally, on you.</sentence><sentence id="266">I think the importance of the trial is much more on what it revealed than in the fact that it punished 19 defendants, and acquitted three.</sentence><sentence id="267">The effect of the trial later on, was very mixed.</sentence><sentence id="268">For some years, it had very little effect, and then as war crimes were committed in ce-central Europe, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and then later in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span>, world attention turned much more to what international law was, that international law</sentence><sentence id="270">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 12 was being violated, and that there was no established structure to deal with these crimes, and that no <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was available which was -- had jurisdiction to handle these matters.</sentence><sentence id="271">So then you started to get the foundation laid and an international treaty signed to create the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, and later on the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> also created the <span class="BUILDING">Rwanda tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">The <span class="BUILDING">Rwanda tribunal</span> has had a great number of difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="273">It was poorly staffed, poorly financed and was not well taken -- it was not well administrated.</sentence><sentence id="274">On the contrary, I think the -- the beginnings of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal are very promising.</sentence><sentence id="275">They do not have the number of contemporaneous documents or the great amount of contemporaneous documents which we had in the Nuremberg trial.</sentence><sentence id="276">This means they have to rely much more on investigations and interrogating witnesses and that's a much more difficult job to do when you don't have all the knowledge that we had about the detailed operation of the Nazi regime.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: What are the main shortcomings of these later <span class="BUILDING">tribunals</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: International opinion does not regard them as essential to scoring the up events and il-illuminating the background and the nature what went on in the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> that led to some of these things.</sentence><sentence id="294">They aren't international opinion on the whole, is not in the same position of knowledge with respect to what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="295">And you don't have the same push, the same public demand.</sentence><sentence id="296">And the tremendous number of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> are so troubled by their own internal problems that they have not pushed the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> or the established tribunal to do more, more quickly, and they haven't given it as much funding and -- as they should.</sentence><sentence id="297">There are some very able people that have gone into the</sentence><sentence id="299"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 13 leadership of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and I wish them well.</sentence><sentence id="300">I think that they are going to make a -- a big contribution in the long run.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: I wonder if you'd talk about areas of involvement in your life later, that you see as having a direct involvement with your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: I was asked to make a number of speeches at conferences of one kind and another and of course I was instrumental with health and my wife and others in putting on these three Nuremberg reunions.</sentence><sentence id="314">And this took up a lot of time and -- it meant that, however, that we were able to call back my former associates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and keep in touch with them.</sentence><sentence id="315"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> is not something that wears out of your life with time.</sentence><sentence id="316">It -- It becomes a -- an <span class="REGION">area</span> where you think about it at night and you think about it in the morning and you wonder what can the world do, what can -- how can public opinion be advanced so that they're willing to reduce the rights of national sovereignty to a greater extent and to make the international law really international and enforceable by international agency.</sentence><sentence id="317">There are a tremendous number of isolationists and people who raise their hands and say, ""We don't want any foreigners in a position where they can possibly judge Americans."</sentence><sentence id="318">There's a certain appeal in that for citizens who are not too well informed, and it's regrettable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Do you think there are grounds for optimism though?</sentence><sentence id="326">Do you feel things are getting better or getting worse?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: No, I think things are getting somewhat better.</sentence><sentence id="330">I don't think the pace is nearly as great as it should be and certainly not as great as I would like to have it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="333">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberaboutfisonecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 14</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: And how can we change people's attitudes?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: By more education in international affairs at a younger age, for younger people.</sentence><sentence id="336">By having more of the -- the books that have been written on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> circulated more widely, building up interest in -- in a broader public education, so that people are more aware of --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: Oh yes indeed.</sentence><sentence id="344">The fact that I studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and I met many refugees from Hitler, that I traveled into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> while Hitler was in -- in power, in 1934 and 1935, the fact that I worked with anti-Nazi Germans in the Office of Strategic Service, just left an -- an indelible imprint on my -- my whole life.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Well, you touch on a very important point, not so much because of the moral values that my parents had, but they sent me to a small <span class="BUILDING">college</span> my first year, <span class="BUILDING">North Central College</span>, and there I met a minister by the name of Ralph Marion Holdiman, who was a very active Christian Socialist and his ethical values were very stretched into the <span class="REGION">political area</span> and by the time I was done with that first year away at <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, I was -- I was beginning to see the roots of Fascism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and of course then, when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>, Hitler came to power during my junior year, and a number of professors played this up as one might expect, because it was certainly a tremendously forbidding development in international affairs.</sentence><sentence id="370">One of my professors was Selac Perlman, who was the chief historian of labor developments in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">And I can remember one day in a seminar that he burst into tears as someone mentioned what was happening in Nazi Germany.</sentence><sentence id="372">And it was a very moving moment and I can still remember it very well.</sentence><sentence id="373">Max Carl Otto was a -- an American of German descent who was very anti-Nazi and he was also one of my heroes at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="374">I was asked to run the conference on war at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>, shortly after Hitler came to power, and we gathered leaders, including people from <span class="BUILDING">military academies</span> and professors from both Wisconsin and other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, some</sentence><sentence id="376"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 16 ministers, like Re-Reverend Alf da -- Alfred W.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="426">There was quite a bit of segregation at the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> back in the 1930's and there were Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish fraternities and non-Jewish sororities and so on.</sentence><sentence id="427">And the -- there was very little mixing of -- inside the frater -- the <span class="BUILDING">sorority</span> or <span class="BUILDING">fraternity houses</span> of Jews and Gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="428">So Beverly Rabinoff, being a good friend of mine, I said to her one day, "Beverly, I've been asked to go to the Tri-Delt House," -- the -- one of the sororities, "for a party.</sentence><sentence id="429">And I'm wondering if you would like to be my guest?"</sentence><sentence id="430">And she said, "Oh, that'll upset things a great deal."</sentence><sentence id="431">And I said, "Well, why not?</sentence><sentence id="432">After all, you're a Badger Beauty, and if you go in there, we'll cause -- with me -- we'll cause quite a sensation."</sentence><sentence id="433">So we ap -- walked into the <span class="BUILDING">sorority house</span> at the time of that party and people's jaws dropped.</sentence><sentence id="434">However, within minutes, everybody wanted to dance with Beverly Rabinoff.</sentence><sentence id="435">All the men wanted to dance with her and I was left alone throughout most of the evening while other people danced with Beverly Rabinoff.</sentence><sentence id="436">So that was a small contribution to integration.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: Well, in my <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span>, which had no Jews, Phi Gamma Delta, I got el -- Edward Ellsworth Ross, who was a former Phi Gam to come and talk and I urged him to talk about the segregation problem and things like that, which he did.</sentence><sentence id="452">And so there was</sentence><sentence id="454"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 18 some things like that.</sentence><sentence id="455">The dean of students, a fellow by the name of Holt, H-o-I-t, his son was in our fraternity.</sentence><sentence id="456">We went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and -- and the overall dean was Scott Goodenite.</sentence><sentence id="457">Bill Blaiser, who was the head of the student union, and I, went up to see him and told him that we were about to try something, that we wanted him to know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="458">Some Jews had gone onto the <span class="DLF">pier</span> that stuck out into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Mindoda</span>, of one of the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity houses</span> -- I forget the name of it right now.</sentence><sentence id="459">And a fellow by the name of Max Knecht, K-n-e-c-h-t, who was the boxing champion of the big 10, went out with a couple of his fraternity brothers and threw these Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="460">And this, of course, made a lot of newspaper publicity.</sentence><sentence id="461">Blaiser -- Bill Blaiser and I didn't want it to die at that point, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goodenite</span> and said, "We're going down to see --" Blaiser was over six feet tall and so was I, and together we weren't too afraid of Max Knecht.</sentence><sentence id="462">So we went down to the <span class="BUILDING">fraternity</span> and asked to see him and he blustered out and said, "What are you liberals doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="463">We said, "We've come to tell you that if you were to repeat what you did before, we can give you the straight word that you'd be ostracized from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and that we would gather a group of people and throw you in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> just to show that we wouldn't take this kind of thing any more."</sentence><sentence id="464">And he said, "Rrrr," and turned around, banged the <span class="DLF">door</span> and left.</sentence><sentence id="465">But Max Knecht never threw any more Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: What about your own politics and the way in which your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> experience might have colored that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Well, I became very active in politics after I returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">Up to that time, I had been an active Democrat in the sense of making a few contributions to the Democratic party and congressional campaign committees and so on, but I hadn't been very active.</sentence><sentence id="501">But when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, my wife was also an active Democrat and I settled out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland area</span>, which is largely an area of relatively wealthy people.</sentence><sentence id="502">And a lot of brainy people, a lot of intellectuals who had done well.</sentence><sentence id="503">So we formed -- I became precinct chairman and we also formed a -- a group out there, which was calculated to give talks about -- in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and otherwise, about anti-Semitism and -- and so forth and the local pastors were all for this.</sentence><sentence id="504">Reverend Gloid Alice in the <span class="BUILDING">Methodist church</span> was one of our great supporters and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="505">So, yes, this did have an e-effect and I went down to the <span class="DLF">hill</span> with the idea of becoming an assistant to somebody that was helping on small business affairs, since I was running a couple of small <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">A <span class="BUILDING">land development company</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">construction company</span> out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span>.</sentence><sentence id="507">And I met Senator Sparkman, head of the Senate small business committee, and Rite Patman, the head of the <span class="BUILDING">House</span> small</sentence><sentence id="509"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 20 business committee.</sentence><sentence id="510">I went in to s -- They said I should go see Paul Butler, the national chairman of the Democratic party and I did and he established the small business division of the Democrat national committee, which was composed of me and my secretary, no more.</sentence><sentence id="511">And we developed a lot of literature, which was broadly circulated to the state parties, county and local people, concerning small business issues.</sentence><sentence id="512">So that was my first move, actively into politics.</sentence><sentence id="513">About a year later, after the 1956 election, I was back to doing what I had been doing before, someone said -- Paul Butler, the national chairman, was forming a new s-structures to the Democratic national committee, which was going to pull together the political organization and build up more precincts and ex-extend the amount of public relations that the national committee was going to have with the local organizations between elections.</sentence><sentence id="514">So I went in to see Paul Butler and he immediately said, "Well, I'd like to hire you, but I have to consult with the advisory committee on political organization."</sentence><sentence id="515">So I flew out to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> to see former congressman, Neal Staebler, S-t-a-e-b-l-e-r, who was the state chairman of the Democratic party in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">And he introduced me to the Michigan leaders, and we sat down and had a dinner together and they queried me and they came back with the recommendation that I be made deputy chairman of the national committee -- deputy chairman for political organization.</sentence><sentence id="517">And we then hired a total of six regional representatives, each one of whom had six to eight states, and he -- they traveled around, building up ideas of better Democratic organization, and not trying to be pushy, but ta -- get more people involved, hold more meetings and they would be</sentence><sentence id="519">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 21 available to see what was happening in another <span class="COUNTRY">state</span>, to help -- still a different state, ye -- other notions and ideas and try new things out and things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="544">Q: Now what would the group have grilled you about, when they met with you over dinner, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: Not particularly.</sentence><sentence id="547">It was a very friendly discussion between active Democrats.</sentence><sentence id="548">And of course, they were interested in the fact that I'd been a prosecutor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and that I had edited the official volumes on the later 12 trials, the so-called Green series and I think they were kind of glad to have me come aboard.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: No, I just wondered what role <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> might have had in -- in that, and you answered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: I don't think it -- I don't think it had much direct role, it -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> exposures of things that were against democracy and the dictatorship, of course, contributed to democracy and I often mentioned the Fascist dictatorship in my discussions, naturally, because they'd been such a big part of my life, earlier.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="557">Your years as deputy chair, wh-what do you look back on as your accomplishments in that role?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Well, we were asked to come to the Democratic National Convention and to make a presentation to the whole convention.</sentence><sentence id="561">So Paul Butler introduced me and I said, fac -- many of you people here, that are active at the state level, know what has been done by the political organization wing of the Democratic National Committee.</sentence><sentence id="562">Well, I want to just -- just tell you a few things that we have done and will be doing and to ha -- allow</sentence><sentence id="564"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 22 you to ask questions, encourage your questions and then I want to have each of the regional representatives talk to you and so on.</sentence><sentence id="565">So, up here, in a little book that contains the proceedings of the Democratic National Committee convention in 1959, you" ll find about 10 pages where we spoke for perhaps altogether, up to nearly an hour.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: What were the most important issues then?</sentence><sentence id="575">You were in that role from -- Was that 1957 to 1960?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="579">Do you know, I -- Ihave a hard time now, figuring out what the roles were that we most talked about.</sentence><sentence id="580">I think they generally involved the idea of more social reform that would benefeet-fit people.</sentence><sentence id="581">We had a -- a senior citizens group as well and we had an agriculture group, a farmer's group.</sentence><sentence id="582">We had a labor group, and they were available to help push democratic ideas through the democratic digest and through special releases and through the many speeches that we helped influence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="588">Q: What about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and your -- your post-<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> sort of sensitivity in the decades after that?</sentence><sentence id="589">I'm thinking of major events, the Civil Rights Movement or the McCarthy era or the Feminist movement.</sentence><sentence id="590">I think you would have been a person with sort of strong views on -- at all these times, a clear sense of what was right and wrong.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Well, yes, but I -- I think it's rather difficult for me to go into all the ethical and political implications of that time back there, three years before 1960.</sentence><sentence id="595">We helped elect President Kennedy and we were delighted with that.</sentence><sentence id="596">I can still remember when he was leaving the <span class="DLF">platform</span> in -- at the 1960 convention and some poor photographer had gotten off to the side and -- and had missed him, so I flagged him down as he was</sentence><sentence id="598">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 23 walking across the <span class="DLF">exit ramp</span>, and he stopped and waved and this fellow took a picture.</sentence><sentence id="599">Well, little things like that are those that stick out in your mind as you look back.</sentence><sentence id="600">The fact that you -- we had a big conference in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> and -- and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">head table</span> of about 17.</sentence><sentence id="601">The head of the party in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> had the central <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and Kennedy sat next to him, in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="602">I sat in seat 17, on the very end and I said nothing, because I wasn't called on to say anything.</sentence><sentence id="603">We'd -- We weren't -- We didn't -- The [indecipherable] organization side of the Democratic National Committee encouraged other people to be active and talking and doing things.</sentence><sentence id="604">We were not the public relations side of the committee, which created speeches and things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="618">Q: But it would be hugely important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="620">A: Yes, it -- some people have said that's -- without our work, that Kennedy wouldn't have been elected.</sentence><sentence id="621">Well, I think that's problematical, but in all events, we were certainly a large contribution.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="624">Q: Did you talk, you know, in these -- a-at these times?</sentence><sentence id="625">Would your experiences at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had been something that you'd -- would often -- would it often come up in conversation?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="722">A: Yes, in 1990, after Saddam Hussein invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>, George Bush -- President George Bush, after consultation with a number of people that were leaders in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and the Secretary General of NATO, he ordered military forces of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to take measures to push back the for -- forces of <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">This was done in a magnificent fashion, by a -- special troops.</sentence><sentence id="724">The trouble is that an agreement was made with Saddam Hussein, which didn't provide for any permanent occu -- occupation and which didn't provide for any war crimes trials, and which allowed him, over time, to re-institute a dictatorship of the first water.</sentence><sentence id="725">Now, that is utterly different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, where we -- the allies that occupied the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, they not only conducted war crimes trials, but they assisted the democratic elements, which were latent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to slowly develop and to come out.</sentence><sentence id="726">We did not have the wisdom to do that, as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and -- in connection with the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> at the time, which is a most regrettable thing, and yet it does deal with the thing that started out very well.</sentence><sentence id="727">An inconclusive truce.</sentence><sentence id="728">I suppose the next thing would be what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and -- beginning in 1991, when military forces of <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>, there were atrocities committed on a huge scale and the fact that there had been a Nuremberg trial certainly did help, with respect to the creation of the international</sentence><sentence id="730">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberaboutfisonecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 28 criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</sentence><sentence id="731">The war crimes are being studied on a great -- a greatly improved scale, by a number of <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="732">The -- At American College of Law, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, it's a part of the <span class="BUILDING">American University</span>, a professor by the name of Diane F. Orentlicher, O-r-e-n-t-l-i-c-h-e-r, is the director of the war crimes research office, and she has led a group which has helped investigate the details of what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and passed them on to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>, because the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> didn't have an adequate staff to do as good a job as it might.</sentence><sentence id="733">And that very creditable work has been appreciated by several of the top prosecutors, including Louise Arbour, A-r-b-o-u-r, and a conference was held at the Washington College of Law School -- the Wa-Washington College of Law, and several of these representatives, the very top ones, from the International War Crimes Tribunal in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span>, came and participated in that trial, which got fairly good publicity.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="748">Q: And you were involved in that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="750">A: Yes, in a minor way.</sentence><sentence id="751">I -- I made one little talk and so forth, but thank goodness she had trained and gotten a lot of people who are presently active.</sentence><sentence id="752">And so my contribution was very limited, and should have been very limited, because they were all sa -- the top people there were all familiar with what had happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and what I might say would be redundant and not too useful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="756">Q: Are we moving quickly enough, do you think?</sentence><sentence id="757">I mean, we're -- I'm -- I'm thinking of the year 2000 and really this is a new area of -- of law that's evolving.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="763"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 29</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: Well, what's evolving is not so much the law itself, because I think that's relatively clear.</sentence><sentence id="765">It's acceptance by many of the sovereign nations that's still not appropriate, number one, and number two, we don't have an international structure that's sufficiently powerful.</sentence><sentence id="766">The enactment of the International War Crimes Tribunal Treaty earlier this year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, the Rome treaty, is a big step in the right direction, but look what year it is.</sentence><sentence id="767">It's the year 1998 and that's still -- that treaty still has to be ratified by a number of leading nations, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="768">So th-the -- these is -- this is a very unpleasant <span class="REGION">area</span> for someone like me, who would like to see that moving much more rapidly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: How do you think we can change, most quickly, mankind's viewpoint on this?</sentence><sentence id="775">I mean, you went through a particular experience in your life, but how can that education you had, that sensitivity be spread to more people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Well, it isn't just a question of spreading sensitivity to more people.</sentence><sentence id="779">If people are poor, if people are struggling to stay alive, they tend to be willing to follow a person who has simple answers and who claims to have an enemy, particularly a neighbor or a group or a race.</sentence><sentence id="780">And he drums up agitation about that and these poor, relatively uneducated people throng to his support.</sentence><sentence id="781">So the question of war crimes really gets down partly to the world's ability to feed more people, on the one hand, and to curb population growth on the other, so we don't have these tremendous cases of people struggling to stay alive, in terms of limited resources.</sentence><sentence id="782">And the question of educating people who are struggling and fighting among themselves and having great</sentence><sentence id="784">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 30 difficulties, to sit back and think and learn, is certainly a central difficulty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="794">Q: Do you have great concern over the increasing discrepancy i -- within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, of wealth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="796">A: Yes, indeed, yes indeed.</sentence><sentence id="797">How many people are living just above the standard of living or just below it?</sentence><sentence id="798">And here we are, supposedly in a very prosperous ca -- time, and yet there are just tremendous numbers of people who are ill-educated and don't have the opportunity to forge ahead.</sentence><sentence id="799">The -- The remaining unequal treatment -- the continuing unequal treatment of women, is certainly a significant area where more people have got to become concerned and to do something.</sentence><sentence id="800">What -- I'm -- I -- My main worry is -- is places like <span class="REGION">Africa</span>, where you have civil wars on every other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> going on, and undoubtedly war crimes or civilian crimes that are at such a broad rate that they have to be classified as something of -- as violations of international law as well.</sentence><sentence id="801">These things have got to be addressed and more people have got to get to work educating more people, who will do something about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: When you refer to women, were you thinking of women within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or really women worldwide in the -- the haves and have-nots of -- you know, the lot of women in the <span class="REGION">developing world</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="810">A: Well, I think Marian Wright Edelman, who's -- heads the Children's Defense Fund, and Hillary Rodham Clinton and a number of other people are trying to do something to a-advance the treatment and education of children, as well as to involve more women in the economic affairs and the political affairs of this nation.</sentence><sentence id="811">And, you know,</sentence><sentence id="813">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0004 31 more power to them, but it's a long way to go.</sentence><sentence id="814">So many people are struggling from day to day that they don't have time to really sit down and think things through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: I wonder if I could ask, I'm -- I'm thinking of today as just one example of a day and with each day's news, I would suppose that you have an interesting viewpoint on it.</sentence><sentence id="823">And a -- I was thinking today of the election of a new political leader in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and w-within the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I'm -- I'm thinking of the Lewinsky case.</sentence><sentence id="824">There may be other things you want to comment on, but a -- I just think that your own life experiences give you sort of informed views on things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: No, I don't care to become a great commentator at the age of 85 years, concerning all kinds of domestic affairs.</sentence><sentence id="829">I think o-others can do a lot better job of that than I can.</sentence><sentence id="830">I think that the election in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, of the new Prime Minister is a -- an indication that there is still more attention being paid in Europe to international affairs.</sentence><sentence id="831">His election I think, like the election of Tony Blair in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span>, is la -- is more encouraging, because I think it will strengthen NATO and strengthen adherence to international law and treaties.</sentence><sentence id="832">I think it will lead to more crossing the <span class="DLF">boundaries</span> with respect to reaching people who violate international law and commit atrocities.</sentence><sentence id="833">As I think I pointed out before, the -- under Cole, as -- as well as I think under the new Premier, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will not be in the background, with respect to taking the lead on strengthening international law and NATO.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="840">Q: How do you think your own views have changed with time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="845"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 32</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="846">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was an extension in international affairs of some of the ethical principles that had been ground into me for many years before that.</sentence><sentence id="847">So I didn't feel I was moving into new <span class="REGION">territory</span> with respect to decency and ethics, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="848">I knew I was moving in -- into new <span class="REGION">territory</span> with respect to getting international structures made, which could begin to deal with some of the things which were -- which need to be handled on an international basis.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q: What are you proudest of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="854">A: Well, I'm of course proudest of having served in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> for four years, and for having been editor in chief of the 15 Green volumes, called, "Trials of War Criminals," before the Nuremberg military tribunals.</sentence><sentence id="855">I suppose that's what I'm most proud of.</sentence><sentence id="856">I hope I'll similarly be proud of this book, but we have to see about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="860">Q: Well, that's part -- that's in a sense a natural progression.</sentence><sentence id="861">But did you have a sense that -- that your parents were immensely proud of you and what you'd accomplished?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="864">Did they understand the -- the significance, do you feel, at the time of their deaths?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: I think my parents were very proud of the fact that I received some recognition for my work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and that I had become a supergrade and a Deputy Chief Council, but we didn't talk too much about those kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="866">We talked about m- many more local things that were of importance in <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> and my father and I took fishing trips in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, and we played golf together and enjoyed each other, but we didn't engage in a tremendous na -- amount of discussion about my past.</sentence><sentence id="867">They obviously were proud of some of the things I'd done, but we didn't talk much about it.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="871"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0004 33</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="872">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Drexel Sprecher.</sentence><sentence id="873">, Side A Conclusion of Interview</sentence></p></dialogue>
