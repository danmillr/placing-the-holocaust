id="150">They were in 5 o'clock in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">We lived on the <span class="DLF">border</span>, German...<span class="DLF">German

artillery pieces, preparing for the German army.</sentence><sentence id="159">They declared war and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> the same way.</sentence><sentence id="160">And when they marched in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they put signs on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> that says you know, destroying is very hard...very easy, and <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is very hard.</sentence><sentence id="161">All people should live together and get along.</sentence><sentence id="162">Jews, gentiles, and everybody and building a future because your government was corrupted and from now on everything be fine.</sentence><sentence id="163">So we read that sign, figured well it's not too bad.</sentence><sentence id="164">How bad can it be.</sentence><sentence id="165">Okay, a day passed by and the next day we hear...we're sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you know, everybody sitting, you know, hiding, not to stick your nose out too far, and we hear shooting and shooting and shooting.</sentence><sentence id="166">We thought who knows what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="167">We didn't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="168">We thought maybe the Polish armies coming back, which was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="169">Then they...uh...the police, the German Gestapo and the SS came into the...to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and start screaming we should get out.</sentence><sentence id="170">Get out!</sentence><sentence id="171">Get out!</sentence><sentence id="172">He says and they start saying that someone was shooting at them.</sentence><sentence id="173">That was their excuse to start the trouble.</sentence><sentence id="174">And they dragged everybody out.</sentence><sentence id="175">Uh...the...the people which were...my brothers were at the age of 17, 18, or 19, they were dragged down to an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Me and my mother and my sister...no, my sister wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="177">My sister was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">Me and my mother and an older brother was dragged into a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a block away.</sentence><sentence id="180">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">We saw bodies laying all over....by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there laying bodies because they were shooting constantly at anybody who was going, passing by.</sentence><sentence id="182">They accused us that we were shooting at them, which I don't believe nobody ever would dare shoot at them.</sentence><sentence id="183">Came to the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was stuffed with people.</sentence><sentence id="184">You know, they just stuffed us in.</sentence><sentence id="185">It was so hot that we couldn't breath.</sentence><sentence id="186">Finally, one German had a pity so he took that long stick to open the...the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, the <span class="DLF">Gothic windows</span> and busted the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">A little <span class="DLF">air</span> came in.</sentence><sentence id="188">Horses were in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="189">They pushed in horses.</sentence><sentence id="190">They were doing all over.</sentence><sentence id="191">And...and eventually L...I looked at the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="192">| didn't see much of them.</sentence><sentence id="193">They had a signed on their buckles, "God with us."</sentence><sentence id="194">You know, that means God is with us.</sentence><sentence id="195">That's...every buckle on the German soldier.</sentence><sentence id="196">I figured maybe it's true.</sentence><sentence id="197">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="198">And we stayed there over night.</sentence><sentence id="199">And meanwhile the...the Pollacks were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> for the...when the Germans...for the Germans come in so they're building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> to protect the...uh...in case <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> march into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they had some <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> would go into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and never come out.</sentence><sentence id="201">But this never materialized.</sentence><sentence id="202">They filled up all the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> with dead people.</sentence><sentence id="203">Just piled them up to the top.</sentence><sentence id="204">Some was still alive, you know.</sentence><sentence id="205">The next day they let us out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">We walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> side..side...on the side of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">We were afraid to walk in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="208">You get blown away.</sentence><sentence id="209">Came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and a couple of days later, everybody was sort of released from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">My brothers came back and...and it got quiet.</sentence><sentence id="211">And then we knew already what it...what...what's happened.</sentence><sentence id="212">Because you can't...you knew already that they pulled a fast one, what's gonna happen.</sentence><sentence id="213">Then slowly, we...they used to come around.</sentence><sentence id="214">They...we formed a...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was formed like a work for the...the Nazis if need anything.</sentence><sentence id="215">One day they came and they say that the Jews should...uh...give all the cameras....you have cameras.</sentence><sentence id="216">Then if you have any fur, if you have any expensive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, so you have to bring it down to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>...in the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">Carried it down yourself, and if they liked it just keep it.</sentence><sentence id="218">If they didn't like it, they say bring it back.</sentence><sentence id="219">So and then every week was something else.</sentence><sentence id="220">And then they start...they see the...uh...they wanted to squash down all these things in case there be a riot or something against the Germans, so they decided to take all the intelligent people and try to put them in...in certain <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span>, they put them in.</sentence><sentence id="221">And the time when this was going on...for a year, they <span class="BUILDING">building</span>...they had built a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="222"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>. __</sentence><sentence id="223">they called it.</sentence><sentence id="224"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was built for...for people like undesirables they called, and for intelligent people.</sentence><sentence id="226">Polish engineers, professors, all these people they...they picked up and shipped them there.</sentence><sentence id="227">And they shipped them, and a week later the wife or the children got a package in the mail and they opened the packages, there was these clothes over there and they say he died of an incurable disease.</sentence><sentence id="228">This was going on for almost a year.</sentence><sentence id="229">And they were sending out everybody.</sentence><sentence id="230">Anybody who was sort of intelligent, teachers, principals, anything which had something to organize.</sentence><sentence id="231">They were afraid if someone would organize, and if they had only a bunch of people, common people, no one would organize.</sentence><sentence id="232">This was going on and they were given notice to the community, any Jew has gold he should report the gold and we did that and we did a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="233">Finally, we were start working in...in slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="234">They used to take us out every night.</sentence><sentence id="235">There was snow and they dragged us out and put us to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> in the middle of the night to clean...clean the snow from the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">And then they...we had a little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> where we used to go there.</sentence><sentence id="237">So they used to take...some pick up...some most beautiful ladies, they picked them up, brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, raped them and undressed them and made fools out of them, and then they released them.</sentence><sentence id="238">That was fine.</sentence><sentence id="239">That was no...not as bad then.</sentence><sentence id="240">And like I said, they're shipping out people this one the other one.</sentence><sentence id="241">And finally came a time they say we're going to form a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">They want the Jews to be separate from everything.</sentence><sentence id="243">They formed a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had around 39,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="245">People...they're weren't so many Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but when the...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which suffered more figured they'd come here because this maybe be a little better <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, so people from all over, from the outskirting communities, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, all came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And it was very crowded.</sentence><sentence id="247">And that was going on for a short time.</sentence><sentence id="248">And then the war...and then the war started between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and the Russian-Germany.</sentence><sentence id="249">The pact was broken.</sentence><sentence id="250">And that was fine.</sentence><sentence id="251">Everything was not bad.</sentence><sentence id="252">I mean it was bad, but not bad.</sentence><sentence id="253">But when the Germans start losing the war, when the Russians put up a fight and the Germans seen it's not working well, then they start taking care all these...they start going after the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="254">They decided to...uh...start sending people out.</sentence><sentence id="255">They claim they're sending them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="257">So they...uh...took the...took the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">They locked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in.</sentence><sentence id="259">You couldn't get in, get out.</sentence><sentence id="260">All the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were locked with the Gestapo SS.</sentence><sentence id="261">And when they locked these things then the...they had a chief of the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="262">His name was Degenhauf.</sentence><sentence id="263">He came with his cronies and stood in...at a certain <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">He picked a certain <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Everybody got out of this <span class="DLF">block</span> and he was passing by.</sentence><sentence id="266">And everybody was passing by in front of him, and he decided which way to go.</sentence><sentence id="267">Left and right.</sentence><sentence id="268">I didn't know which <span class="NPIP">way</span> was good.</sentence><sentence id="269">Left or right.</sentence><sentence id="270">Now I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="271">Then I knew what was good.</sentence><sentence id="272">So he picked out...let's say he picked out from a block of 10,000 people, he picked out 500, 600 and send them in to a...to a <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">It was like a...a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>...made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> out of it.</sentence><sentence id="274">People should stay there...send us in there.</sentence><sentence id="275">And this was going on, I think, for a week.</sentence><sentence id="276">Every <span class="DLF">block</span>, every little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">Then it came to us, finally came to our <span class="REGION">section</span>, because we looked out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> we see what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="278">They were shooting and killing.</sentence><sentence id="279">Anybody who walked the wrong <span class="NPIP">way</span> was shot.</sentence><sentence id="280">So when it came to us, we lived in a certain section, so we decided we go up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and break through the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">Maybe we'll go to the next <span class="DLF">block</span>, so we'll be able to survive another week.</sentence><sentence id="282">Maybe they'll change their mind and they would ship us out anymore.</sentence><sentence id="283">So we went to the...uh... about two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away and we stood there.</sentence><sentence id="284">We laid in the...the <span class="DLF">yards</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">Finally, they took us too.</sentence><sentence id="286">They had enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, so they decided they make a selection and clean out the rest of the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">When they cleaned...so we were standing in that <span class="DLF">yard</span>, my brothers were still there.</sentence><sentence id="288">Not everybody, the older brother with his child was shipped out a day before because he lived in another <span class="NPIP">section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">And when they came to our <span class="DLF">block</span> and came into the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, they start looking around, they see too many people because people came from other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> so they figured they'd scare and they start shooting.</sentence><sentence id="290">They saw my brother, so they shot him.</sentence><sentence id="291">They chased him and shot him by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And...uh...and then they made a selection and when to...and I was picked to remain in the...in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>...these what you call...they were big <span class="BUILDING">industry building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">And they figured they'd stuff us in there meanwhile.</sentence><sentence id="294">So I was stuffed in in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with my other brothers and we stood there for a day or two.</sentence><sentence id="295">Then they decided they still have too many people.</sentence><sentence id="296">They had a little idea.</sentence><sentence id="297">They had another metal plant there called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Metalubia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">That was a...a metal plant.</sentence><sentence id="299">They decided...they must have had 10,000 Jews or more, so they decide they open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and the same guy stood with his cronies and start picking.</sentence><sentence id="300">And when I marched through he decided to ship me the wrong way, so I didn't...I had no...I had no idea what's going to be, but I followed.</sentence><sentence id="301">If 1 don't follow, I get blown away, so I walked a couple of feet, maybe 50 feet and I lined up with the...with the people.</sentence><sentence id="302">I seen the element which was picked out.</sentence><sentence id="303">So I knew I'm...I'm...I'm in bad shape.</sentence><sentence id="304">I'm going with the wrong people.</sentence><sentence id="305">Picked out some old people, some people couldn't walk; some people walked with a crutch.</sentence><sentence id="306">You know, they wanted pure...what you call, a guy who is working, a guy who wore glasses wasn't a candidate to remain either.</sentence><sentence id="307">You had to be...look like almost everybody looked.</sentence><sentence id="308">You couldn't look any different.</sentence><sentence id="309">Okay, so I was picked.</sentence><sentence id="310">And then the Gestapo was marching us down to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">There were a <span class="BUILDING">freight railroad station</span>, not the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">We're marching down; everybody carried their pieces of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> they had, and they...some of them couldn't carry so the...the SS were whipping them on the way when they carry, so they dropped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and some other people which lived picked it up.</sentence><sentence id="313">Some Polish people jumped out and picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">They figured get ahold okay.</sentence><sentence id="315">When we came down to the...a...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, they were stuffing people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I seen I be next so I moved back a little.</sentence><sentence id="317">I figured if I move back maybe I'll still have a chance to remain, or if they haven't got no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, maybe they ship me back to the...to this...uh...what you call Metalulia, that <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">Unfortunate, I waited too long.</sentence><sentence id="319">They brought a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with the incurables, and put every body in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">And me put in there too.</sentence><sentence id="321">Most of them what they brought down were almost half dead.</sentence><sentence id="322">They had...they had typhus and all kind of diseases you could think.</sentence><sentence id="323">They stuffed me in there.</sentence><sentence id="324">I couldn't breath because they had these medications on them.</sentence><sentence id="325">I was a short fellow.</sentence><sentence id="326">I wasn't tall then.</sentence><sentence id="327">And I couldn't reach the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">You know, eventually I got stuck by a <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">The <span class="DLF">window</span> was covered with barbed wire.</sentence><sentence id="330">You couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="331">So first day I couldn't reach.</sentence><sentence id="332">The second day I reached already, because there were so many dead bodies laying, so I stepped on one or two and I reached the <span class="DLF">window</span> and looked out.</sentence><sentence id="333">Looked out, I see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> keeps puffing; <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> keeps going and puffing and puffing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="334">Some people say well, maybe we're going to a...to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, maybe we're going here.</sentence><sentence id="335">You know, you always have hope.</sentence><sentence id="336">You can't say for sure...you know, a person lays in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he says you...he has no chance.</sentence><sentence id="337">Eventually some of them come out of too.</sentence><sentence id="338">And we puffed...I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going for 2 days or 3 days.</sentence><sentence id="339">I would say most of them died in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">They couldn't survived.</sentence><sentence id="341">And...and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived in the morning 3 days later, we were going up north.</sentence><sentence id="342">We going towards...towards ...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">I don't know if I ever came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">Maybe we went.</sentence><sentence id="345">Our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malking</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">Was a <span class="DLF">junction</span> up north near...pass <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">We got there and...uh...we were all, like I said, there was nothing...just laying with dead bodies and the stench was unbearable.</sentence><sentence id="348">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malking</span>...uh...L...1 looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">I see the sun shining; beautiful weather; <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> growing, but nothing for us. (</sentence><sentence id="350">crying) Took a half hour.</sentence><sentence id="351">They disconnected the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, what they did.</sentence><sentence id="352">Had a...Malking was a <span class="DLF">junction</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was going back south.</sentence><sentence id="354">I was coming from south, but was south...southeast.</sentence><sentence id="355">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> couldn't come in to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> had a...a <span class="DLF">platform</span> for four, five...four, five...uh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">So they disconnected and start pushing back.</sentence><sentence id="358">I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and I...I didn't know where I was going.</sentence><sentence id="359">Finally, they pushed, pushed very slow the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="360">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving slow, and they pushed me into...to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>...pushed me in and I looked out.</sentence><sentence id="361">I seen Gestapo guards, dogs and guys with whips and waiting and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and start whipping and hitting people over the head and...and the dead bodies remained.</sentence><sentence id="362">And...uh...what happened so...I was out too, and pushed me into a little... like a little <span class="DLF">court yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">The <span class="DLF">court yard</span> was a place where everybody got us and they told us to get undressed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="364">Man, ladies, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="365">Had some neighbors, very distinguished people.</sentence><sentence id="366">Her father owned a <span class="BUILDING">drug store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">I remember she stood with a kid there and she walked over to the SS, and wanted to ask him, so he whipped her so hard with that whip and then he dropped her on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">I don't what happened there.</sentence><sentence id="369">What happened there, she died...she died any how.</sentence><sentence id="370">So what happened?</sentence><sentence id="371">Then they start picking.</sentence><sentence id="372">What happened in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, there were at least 900 or a thousand prisoners which were...didn't have more than that.</sentence><sentence id="373">So they needed...because they were killing people like flies so the...the quota was low, so one of the Gestapo decided to pick couple of people.</sentence><sentence id="374">I think he picked maybe 10 or 12.</sentence><sentence id="375">And I was half undressed.</sentence><sentence id="376">So I see he's picking so I jumped into the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">And then we marched away.</sentence><sentence id="378">We marched out to the main...main lot where people were dropping clothes.</sentence><sentence id="379">I dropped...I walked out there and he checked me and looked over and looked in.</sentence><sentence id="380">I'm fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="381">I don't why he didn't kill me immediately because I was half undressed.</sentence><sentence id="382">And then what happened...uh...decided there was coffee break or lunch so everybody marched towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because it was around maybe 12:00, 1:00.</sentence><sentence id="383">So, I marched towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, got ahold of a couple rag shirts laying all over, shoes, and...uh...I was safe then.</sentence><sentence id="384">And the rest of them were send into that <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">From that <span class="DLF">yard</span>, they got undressed and marched into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">You heard screaming fill the <span class="DLF">skies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">You see mothers with little children on...on the arms walking, you know, screaming and using these...uh... religious like some people are gentile got...when he get's hit, he says, "Jesus Christ."</sentence><sentence id="388">And a Jew gets hit he says .So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="389">They were marching in and when they marched in, they closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you heard screaming like people choking to death and a couple of minutes quiet down and that was going on every day I was there.</sentence><sentence id="390">That's all.</sentence><sentence id="391">Was going on, and my job was the next...uh...in the afternoon, my job was on the...on the main lot to separate clothes.</sentence><sentence id="392">Uh...Let's say shoes to shoes, wool to wool.</sentence><sentence id="393">And after that, a day later, they decided the people which are coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they should sep...they should get their clothes...the shoes separate and the clothes separate.</sentence><sentence id="394">When they came out to the <span class="DLF">lot</span> they dropped every piece of clothes on a different...different pile.</sentence><sentence id="395">The piles were high.</sentence><sentence id="396">I would say 3, 4 stories high on top.</sentence><sentence id="397">There were shoes.</sentence><sentence id="398">Millions, thousands of shoes, thousands of clothes, thousands of...uh...luggages and...and there were big metal boxes standing there and everybody had to throw in if he had some jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="399">Now everybody, you know, in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know, like in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, people have property.</sentence><sentence id="400">Some cherish certain <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">In the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, if you had a little old ring or a gold watch that was...you...you were cherishing.</sentence><sentence id="402">So eventually these boxes used to fill up very fast.</sentence><sentence id="403">That's all.</sentence><sentence id="404">And they walked in there and they died.</sentence><sentence id="405">That's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="406">This was going on every day.</sentence><sentence id="407">Every day.</sentence><sentence id="408">And so...and I really didn't know where I was.</sentence><sentence id="409">I thought, as I was taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, that if you go to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> or <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">So I thought that maybe I did something wrong as a young kid.</sentence><sentence id="411">You know, you believe in religion because, you know, if a rabbi or anybody else tells you that you...you have to believe in God, so I thought I went to <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>, because I couldn't believe what I see.</sentence><sentence id="412">Thousands of people were coming every day.</sentence><sentence id="413">And a hour later, puff.</sentence><sentence id="414">Fired.</sentence><sentence id="415">People were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">The Polish Jews were coming in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">The Jews from the...from the West, these...these people didn't know much where they're going because they lived in better environment.</sentence><sentence id="418">They were more intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="419">They didn't believe that...uh... something like this could happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="420">So they came with...some of them came with the maids taking care, and they all just marched in.</sentence><sentence id="421">They gave them...some of them gave a piece of soap, make believe they take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and marched in, and that's...that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="422">And we lived in the...there were three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="423">Was <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> 1, 2 and 3.</sentence><sentence id="424">There were two original.</sentence><sentence id="425">One with...at night when we marched into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, we were marched in, and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was unbearable because people were making on their blankets, but you couldn't walk out.</sentence><sentence id="426">There was no such a thing as a...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> or anything, so people were making on top of it because if you stuck your head out, you got blown away.</sentence><sentence id="427">And...uh...so we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="428">And at night some people committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="429">They couldn't take it, you know, because they knew that...uh...they survived and their children and their wives are dead.</sentence><sentence id="430">And...and that's all what was going in these...in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">Every morning we marched out.</sentence><sentence id="432">But what happened at...going back to the...to where the...uh...when people came were from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, they...uh...some people got lost.</sentence><sentence id="433">Some children got lost or some crippled people came which couldn't march into the...to that <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, so they picked them up on a little... like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>, you know, piece of wood, and they brought them in...they called it a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, Lazarette.</sentence><sentence id="434">Had a sign Lazarette.</sentence><sentence id="435">What was this Lazarette, was a...a <span class="DLF">ditch</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and two or three people stood there and...and the SS took the guy over or anybody else and he brought him in, he shot him, and then they burned him.</sentence><sentence id="436">They put some chemicals on, they burned him.</sentence><sentence id="437">And that was...the smell was horrocious, impossible.</sentence><sentence id="438">Sometimes, some children got lost.</sentence><sentence id="439">Little kids, 2 years old, l year old, they got lost.</sentence><sentence id="440">So brought them in there and burned them to death because they were...were too much of a deed to bring them there because by the time you bring him there, they're not going to waste any time.</sentence><sentence id="441">So that's what it was, so I was there for...for 11 days, struggling every day, seeing killing and hanging.</sentence><sentence id="442">And they were whipping people.</sentence><sentence id="443">If they got ahold of somebody he...I don't know, he did something wrong and maybe he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="444">They got ahold of him.</sentence><sentence id="445">They whipped him.</sentence><sentence id="446">When they whipped him, you couldn't recognize the color of his skin.</sentence><sentence id="447">And then they hanged him by his legs.</sentence><sentence id="448">Was hanging for 40 minutes, and he was dead.</sentence><sentence id="449">This was going on every day.</sentence><sentence id="450">Then they had...uh...prepared another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, <span class="BUILDING">barrack 3</span>, by the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">And then there were rumors when this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was ready, they shipped me into this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barrack</span> was a little better, what do you call, cleaner for the first...uh...couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="453">But there were rumors that this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> is going to be liquidated because these are people...so I figured the only way to do is to plan an escape.</sentence><sentence id="454">So L..I planned with another friend.</sentence><sentence id="455">Then I got ahold of another friend, people which I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="456">But...uh...there were other peoples which wanted to escape too.</sentence><sentence id="457">Kids which I knew from...I lived with them on the <span class="DLF">block</span>, but some of them were sort of...I couldn't trust.</sentence><sentence id="458">What do you mean by trust?</sentence><sentence id="459">They weren't...they weren't enough...uh...reliable.</sentence><sentence id="460">You know, they are kids sometimes 10, 12 years which are very reliable people, and some kids are kids.</sentence><sentence id="461">So I left him back.</sentence><sentence id="462">I...before I escaped he had a brother working with him.</sentence><sentence id="463">His brother got shot.</sentence><sentence id="464">He was a good looking guy.</sentence><sentence id="465">He looked too good, so maybe they shot him.</sentence><sentence id="466">So he was left alone, and he was crying to me.</sentence><sentence id="467">He had trouble with his toes.</sentence><sentence id="468">He had ingrown toe nails, the kid, my neighbor.</sentence><sentence id="469">So he was telling me, if you plan anything, take me with you.</sentence><sentence id="470">So I figured dead or alive, it's no time to play games here.</sentence><sentence id="471">So I got...I got these two other fellows and we planned to escape.</sentence><sentence id="472">We says we're going to escape at night because when we by the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and drinking coffee, you know, and we start walking a little away.</sentence><sentence id="473">If any...worse comes to worse, they get ahold of us while we're walking too far, we can get a beating.</sentence><sentence id="474">That's all.</sentence><sentence id="475">Because they wouldn't bother opening the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for...for killing.</sentence><sentence id="476">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first."</sentence><sentence id="477">And before we escaped, I compared myself.</sentence><sentence id="478">I knew if survive it was good to have sugar, and there was plenty food laying which people brought.</sentence><sentence id="479">They thought they're going to a picnic.</sentence><sentence id="480">So I... got ahold of a bag...uh...a bag of sugar with a rope and I put it on my neck, so in case I starve sugar would keep me going.</sentence><sentence id="481">And the other fellows had other stuff.</sentence><sentence id="482">So...uh...this guy says, "You go first.</sentence><sentence id="483">You go first.</sentence><sentence id="484">Time is late.</sentence><sentence id="485">You go first."</sentence><sentence id="486">So I figured, "Okay, I go first."</sentence><sentence id="487">I went first and I ran into the...uh..behind a...a little...small little <span class="DLF">pool</span> where they were having chickens there.</sentence><sentence id="488">Chickens and goose were swimming.</sentence><sentence id="489">I was working there too.</sentence><sentence id="490">So I ran in and I'm waiting.</sentence><sentence id="491">Finally, another fellow comes.</sentence><sentence id="492">My friend comes.</sentence><sentence id="493">He ran so fast I ripped his sleeve off on his jacket.</sentence><sentence id="494">I never seen him.</sentence><sentence id="495">When the third one came he ran so fast, but him...I eventually got a hold of.</sentence><sentence id="496">And we were both stuck in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">We knew that the...the...uh...the...uh...<span class="DLF">towers</span> where they were watching, they're going off 9 o'clock, because if they're pushing you into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they stay on top with the machine guns, one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> facing the other, if anybody walks out, so what's the use to...to watch the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="498">So we waited.</sentence><sentence id="499">And had...had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plier</span> in my pocket to cut the wires.</sentence><sentence id="500">And we waited.</sentence><sentence id="501">Was 9 already, later.</sentence><sentence id="502">Nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="503">So we moved towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="504">I moved towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">And the guy on...on the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> was sitting up there.</sentence><sentence id="506">I don't know if he saw me, if he didn't see me.</sentence><sentence id="507">I can't explain.</sentence><sentence id="508">His machine gun was just moving back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="509">We cut the wires.</sentence><sentence id="510">We went through the <span class="DLF">wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="511">He went through.</sentence><sentence id="512">Before we cut the wire, we were walking like the army on our hands and feet because you couldn't stand up or cut the wire.</sentence><sentence id="513">Went through the <span class="DLF">wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="514">And we ran out, and then we start running and running and running.</sentence><sentence id="515">We didn't know where to run.</sentence><sentence id="516">We had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="517">So we ran almost a whole night.</sentence><sentence id="518">And we said, "If we're going to run, if we want to rest we should at least rest in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>."</sentence><sentence id="519">Unfortunately, we ran so long that we landed up in <span class="REGION">land</span>, just big <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">So we landed and we couldn't walk anymore.</sentence><sentence id="521">So we sit down.</sentence><sentence id="522">And heavy storm came and soaked us through for hours.</sentence><sentence id="523">And we were sitting both holding on to each other.</sentence><sentence id="524">And in the morning around 5 o'clock, we started looking around.</sentence><sentence id="525">We seen a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">A lady walks out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she's trying to open her shutters.</sentence><sentence id="527">So I figured I'll walk over to her.</sentence><sentence id="528">So when I walked over, she knew already who I am because they knew.</sentence><sentence id="529">She says, "You must have been one from the escapees from here.</sentence><sentence id="530">You better walk away because the SS is coming through here, hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> going to the farmers to pick up milk and eggs for the...for their food."</sentence><sentence id="531">So we was standing in...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and waited.</sentence><sentence id="532">She says, "You better leave."</sentence><sentence id="533">She says, "Go a little further down."</sentence><sentence id="534">So went a little further down, and then we met somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="535">Somebody got a hold of us and he says to us, "You know, I could save your life and I could do this for you and other things for you if you have any money."</sentence><sentence id="536">I had some money.</sentence><sentence id="537">I had some Polish money.</sentence><sentence id="538">So we gave him...he says he's going to go to get us some bread and he could do a lot for us.</sentence><sentence id="539">So we gave him some money.</sentence><sentence id="540">He left.</sentence><sentence id="541">When he left, we left because we knew what happened because the Gestapo's gave orders, "if you bring a Jew, you get a pound of sugar."</sentence><sentence id="542">And if he has good shoes, you could take his shoes too."</sentence><sentence id="543">That was the price the Germans gave to the Polish people, but he didn't get a hold of me.</sentence><sentence id="544">He took off, and we...we marched.</sentence><sentence id="545">We marched another couple of miles.</sentence><sentence id="546">I got a hold of a...walked into a <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> and the woman was very nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="547">She came out and walked with me and my friend almost for an hour, showed us to go to another <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">Closed <span class="DLF">road</span> where the police is not there.</sentence><sentence id="549">She was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="550">She came with a little baby on her back and walked and then she left us and she...she made a prayer, you know.</sentence><sentence id="551">You know, she took her cross out and made a prayer, God should be with you.</sentence><sentence id="552">And we went our way.</sentence><sentence id="553">Then we walked another, I think, a mile or two, walked into another <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">We told the farmer we want to go to...to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="555">He says he's going to take us, but he's not going to walk with us...distance away.</sentence><sentence id="556">And he opened a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="557">He says, "In case the SS comes, you just walked in yourself.</sentence><sentence id="558">I had nothing to do."</sentence><sentence id="559">So he...uh...he walked with us.</sentence><sentence id="560">This man walked so fast that you had no idea, so fast.</sentence><sentence id="561">And we followed him.</sentence><sentence id="562">Finally, we came to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">The village name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soldavna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="564">Little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">And he says, "Okay, you're on your own."</sentence><sentence id="566">I says, "No, we're not going to give you the money til you

there.</sentence><sentence id="569"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> was crowded.</sentence><sentence id="570">People were going from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to buy some food.</sentence><sentence id="571">And I been in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for...overnight.</sentence><sentence id="572">In the morning, someone recognized me.</sentence><sentence

Germans.</sentence><sentence id="577">I can get a pound of sugar ad I can get your shoes."</sentence><sentence id="578">So what happened, most of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when they come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they...they...they turn into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they have to slow down because there...there's like a curve and they slow down.</sentence><sentence id="579">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slowed down, I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with my friend because I didn't get to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="580">I figured if 1 get to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, I'd be a dead duck because there's police and Gestapo and all this.</sentence><sentence id="581">I got up and the other guy jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then we walked up the <span

want to go to....uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="585">He says, "Well, you could sleep over my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and tomorrow I'll take you down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="586">Came into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, me and my friend.</sentence><sentence id="587">We laid down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">We slept for 2 days.</sentence><sentence id="589">Then we got up, everything was empty.</sentence><sentence id="590">Anything we had in our pockets, he took out.</sentence><sentence id="591">He left us not even with 0 a cent.</sentence><sentence id="592">And if you haven't got money where can you go?</sentence><sentence id="593">So we told him, "Look, if you give us some money back, keep some of it.</sentence><sentence id="594">If not, we'll blow the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="595">We're not afraid."</sentence><sentence id="596">We're not afraid to die because we knew we're going to die anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="597">So he decided to give us some.</sentence><sentence id="598">And then at night he took us down to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we went towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czectachowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599">Same thing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">Much didn't happen because we're quiet.</sentence><sentence id="601"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> was crowded.</sentence><sentence id="602">When we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestachowa</span>, the

on a curve into the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="605">We jumped out, and we walked.</sentence><sentence id="606">We got ahold of another...somehow, she walks

id="612">So my friend says that, "Look.</sentence><sentence id="613">I have friends here.</sentence><sentence id="614">Gentile friends which my father used to do business with, so maybe they could hide me out and until the war is over."</sentence><sentence id="615">So I says, "I have some too."</sentence><sentence id="616">So L..he went with me.</sentence><sentence id="617">I walked over there and there was a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">bicycle store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="618">I walked in and his wife saw me.</sentence><sentence id="619">His wife knew me, and he knew me.</sentence><sentence id="620">There were customers in there.</sentence><sentence id="621">And he was winking with his eyes I shouldn't say nothing.</sentence><sentence

out.</sentence><sentence id="630">I walked toward the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="631">He wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="632">He took off.</sentence><sentence id="633">He decided maybe he do better on his own than with me.</sentence><sentence id="634">So I was left all alone, you know.</sentence><sentence id="635">I knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="636">I didn't know where to go.</sentence><sentence id="637">I marched the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, marched up, sideways, all over.</sentence><sentence id="638">How much can you walk?</sentence><sentence id="639">You know, you're in danger because, you know, you get picked up, you're dead.</sentence><sentence id="640">So I decided maybe I should...I knew I had a brother working in a...in a...in a...in a <span class="BUILDING">steel mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="641">He was...he was living there because when the war...when they made a selection, they decided that...uh...they wanted good people.</sentence><sentence id="642">They figured if they send him into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they'd never see him, so he remained there.</sentence><sentence id="643">And they slept there.</sentence><sentence id="644">They had a couple of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> they slept in.</sentence><sentence id="645">So I decided, "let me go down there."</sentence><sentence id="646">I went down there and stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="647">I seen a horse with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> turned over right near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="648">So I walked over to the guy.</sentence><sentence id="649">I asked him if he knows if any Jews live here.</sentence><sentence id="650">He says, "Yal, there's some over there working."</sentence><sentence id="651">I says, "Can you call out a guy by

walked out.</sentence><sentence id="656">He saw me.</sentence><sentence id="657">He didn't know what hit him.</sentence><sentence id="658">Where did I come from?</sentence><sentence id="659">What come?</sentence><sentence id="660">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="661">Where's this one?</sentence><sentence id="662">Where's the other one?</sentence><sentence id="663">And, you know, he took me into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I explained it to him exact what happened.</sentence><sentence id="664">It's unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="665">He didn't believe.</sentence><sentence id="666">And then what they did, they put me up in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the commer.</sentence><sentence id="667">They were hiding me.</sentence><sentence id="668">What to do with me?</sentence><sentence id="669">Because they didn't know what to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="670">My brother figured he could remain there, but you couldn't report to the police that somebody else came in.</sentence><sentence id="671">Okay, it came at night...people came back from the shift and it's like...uh...they start asking.</sentence><sentence id="672">You know, it's somebody came in.</sentence><sentence id="673">After all they were for...for...a couple of weeks along, they didn't know what happened to their wife and children, so they started asking where I come from.</sentence><sentence id="674">What it is?</sentence><sentence id="675">So I didn't want to talk.</sentence><sentence id="676">Finally, they forced me to say where I come from so I told them exact what happened to their wives and children.</sentence><sentence id="677">That they're all gassed and died.</sentence><sentence id="678">So then they wanted to kill me because I'm lying.</sentence><sentence id="679">So then they asked my brother if I ever been in a...a emotional sick.</sentence><sentence id="680">They got so 1 furious about it that they squealed on the...squealed the police and if I don't leave, they're gonna report to the police.</sentence><sentence id="681">Middle of the night, it was 12 o'clock at night or 1:00, I was kicked out and finally the police was notified.</sentence><sentence id="682">And they came out, start shooting, but I was sitting in..in the...what you call, in the weeds...the high weeds.</sentence><sentence id="683">The dried up weeds.</sentence><sentence id="684">I was sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="685">Didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="686">Let them shoot.</sentence><sentence id="687">My life wasn't worth anything.</sentence><sentence id="688">It was just like you take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wastebasket</span>, throw it out.</sentence><sentence id="689">I was waiting to...to die any time.</sentence><sentence id="690">What's the use.</sentence><sentence id="691">I mean it's like you want to dispose of your body.</sentence><sentence id="692">It was too much for you.</sentence><sentence id="693">I sat there and then it quiet down and they started screaming, "Hurray.</sentence><sentence id="694">Hurray.</sentence><sentence id="695">We got him.</sentence><sentence id="696">We got him.</sentence><sentence id="697">We got him."</sentence><sentence id="698">I sat there and then I walked away and knocked at another <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="699">The guy was making...uh...funeral boxes on the <span class="DLF">road</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="700">I walked in and he says he can't do nothing for me.</sentence><sentence id="701">The only thing I do is get into the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, stay there, leave the <span class="DLF">door</span> open.</sentence><sentence id="702">If you're in there, you sneaked in yourself.</sentence><sentence id="703">I stood there in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="704">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="705">I decided to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">To the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">Came in again.</sentence><sentence id="708">What're you doing?</sentence><sentence id="709">So my brother decided we're both go together to see where we could go.</sentence><sentence id="710">If we work out, we'll work out.</sentence><sentence id="711">If not, we'll both...if we die, we'll both die.</sentence><sentence id="712">So we took a walk in...along side the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>...was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="713">Took a long <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">We walked a couple of miles.</sentence><sentence id="715">Saw a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, little <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="716">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> must have been maybe 20 by 20.</sentence><sentence id="717">I walked in and the wife wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="718">He was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">He looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="720">Up and down.</sentence><sentence id="721">I looked like...ever see a little...a little dog is lost and he knocks at somebody's <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">He felt sorry for me and he says he can't do nothing til his wife come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">And meanwhile go into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="724">The same thing.</sentence><sentence id="725">Stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="726">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="727">My brother had to run back to the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">If they see he's not there, if they get ahold of him or they find him out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">plant</span> he gets shot.</sentence><sentence id="729">So he was...he left and then his wife came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she fell in love with me and she says, "Yal, we're gonna keep him."</sentence><sentence id="730">And I was there...the first day I was very useful.</sentence><sentence id="731">I used to clean the cows, clean the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, wash clothes for them.</sentence><sentence id="732">And that's what I did for almost a whole month.</sentence><sentence id="733">And they got so used to me that they didn't want me to leave.</sentence><sentence id="734">Mine clothes I used to wash.</sentence><sentence id="735">I used to get insects in my clothes.</sentence><sentence id="736">They had a small <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">So I used to take my clothes and put it to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and put a rock over it, so the...the water was floating down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, took all the insects out.</sentence><sentence id="738">And I lived there for a month, you know, every night, you know, they were used to me. __</sentence><sentence id="739">and taking care of all the <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">And then my brother came once and he says, "They're forming another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="741">Because from the 39,000 everybody was liquidated, and there wasn't much left.</sentence><sentence id="742">And they didn't want the Jews to live in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> because they were shabby <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">Decided to take the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> and close in the <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="744">The <span class="DLF">blocks</span> must have been what?...500 or thousand feet a <span class="DLF">block</span>, close in the sides, so they closed up three <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, four <span class="DLF">blocks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="745">And...and these people which lived in the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plants</span>...they had some people coming down.</sentence><sentence id="746">Let's say you picked out...Let's say 5,000 people in a <span class="BUILDING">plant</span>, they picked out a hundred and they gave them a certain section, and they said, "You make room for you people which come in."</sentence><sentence id="747">So...so they organized a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="748">A small, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">And I found out, so I says, "I'm going to go into the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">So when that <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> was marching in, a day shift...it was a day shift and night shift.</sentence><sentence id="751">So my brother says you stay aside of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="752">When you're marching in, you jump into the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="753">That's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="754">I waited.</sentence><sentence id="755">The man in charge, the German policeman was an old man.</sentence><sentence id="756">He rode on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="757">He couldn't tell the difference from this one or the other one.</sentence><sentence id="758">Marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and...uh...met my brother and...uh...met my brother there and my mother was still alive.</sentence><sentence id="759">My moth...my mother was 2 hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, you know, who had...who had build a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and we ripped out the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we glued up the <span class="DLF">door</span> with bricks.</sentence><sentence id="760">It looked the same so you couldn't tell she was there.</sentence><sentence id="761">She was hiding there for 4, 5 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="762">Finally, they couldn't take it any more.</sentence><sentence id="763">There were children in there too.</sentence><sentence id="764">And the childrens were crying and someone heard the kids crying and they knew they're people hiding.</sentence><sentence id="765">So they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">The shot more...half of the people were shot.</sentence><sentence id="767">My mother sort of survived with my...my sister-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="768">And...uh...they brought in there...they remained in the little...the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="769">They stood in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over there for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="770">And what happened with me is I marched into the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I met them.</sentence><sentence id="771">My mother was still there and my sister-in-law was there with the little kids.</sentence><sentence id="772">And every day what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="773"><span class="BUILDING">Killing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="774">Shoot a hundred.</sentence><sentence id="775">Shoot 2 hundred.</sentence><sentence id="776">One day they came and said...uh...we want all the...uh...intelligent people which was left.</sentence><sentence id="777">We have an order from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="778"><span class="COUNTRY">England</span> sent us a...a cable that we want all these intelligent Jews to go...to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or...<span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="779">So people were...figured they'd take any opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="780">So they loaded up about 5, 6 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with 5, 6 hundred people and they took them down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they threw in and shot them in a common <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="781">That was the end of these.</sentence><sentence id="782">That's was going on.</sentence><sentence id="783">And then we lived in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in fear every day.</sentence><sentence id="784">One day I had a friend who just came from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with me.</sentence><sentence id="785">He got a hold of a gun.</sentence><sentence id="786">He bought a gun because he figured he couldn't take it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="787">If he has to die, he's going to take some...some Germans with him.</sentence><sentence id="788">So one day they picked him up and...uh...you know, they always looked to...anybody looks suspicious...you walked the wrong way, you were shot.</sentence><sentence id="789">So one day, he walked and they had a little...a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">A little small <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where anybody was suspicious was thrown in there.</sentence><sentence id="791">And then...uh...if they were in a good mood, they let you go.</sentence><sentence id="792">If not, they shot you in the back.</sentence><sentence id="793">There was a...a place where the people used to keep ice, you know.</sentence><sentence id="794">Here they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigeration</span>.</sentence><sentence id="795">Then they used to go...in the winter used to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and chop the ice and put it into that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="796">So used to shot into.</sentence><sentence id="797">So...so one day, he had a gun on him.</sentence><sentence id="798">He had bought a gun.</sentence><sentence id="799">So when they took him out and they start shooting people in this...this little <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, he pulled his gun out and wanted to shoot this German guy but unfortunate, his gun was so old, rusty, that it didn't fire.</sentence><sentence id="800">So what he did...he couldn't shoot him so he jumped on him and bit his throat.</sentence><sentence id="801">And meanwhile the other SS saw what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="802">They shot him.</sentence><sentence id="803">Then they decided...what happened every 10s going to be shot.</sentence><sentence id="804">So they took people out.</sentence><sentence id="805">I know there were a thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="806">And every 10 was shot and brought in the bodies.</sentence><sentence id="807">No, they brought the bodies into the <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">There is a big <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and everybody had to go and see, and they were laying there.</sentence><sentence id="809">That's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="810">And then this was going on, I think, for a year.</sentence><sentence id="811">Was miserable living this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="812">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="813">We were buying sometimes <span class="NPIP">outside</span> anything we got a hold of.</sentence><sentence id="814">Horse meat.</sentence><sentence id="815">Anything!</sentence><sentence id="816">Disease.</sentence><sentence id="817">Disease.</sentence><sentence id="818">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was diseased.</sentence><sentence id="819">Was filthy.</sentence><sentence id="820">People were stuffed in in <span class="NPIP">places</span>, you know, so then what happened they decided they're going to liquidate that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">There were I think 6,500 Jews lived in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, liquidation.</sentence><sentence id="822">What do you do with my mother?</sentence><sentence id="823">My mother couldn't walk out and...and face the music because she looked old.</sentence><sentence id="824">She wasn't old, but she didn't look young enough to be that, so we decided we're going to put her in in a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>, a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> over the <span class="DLF">court yard</span>, a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and my sister-in-law with the kid.</sentence><sentence id="825">And this was going on for the time we were in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">They were looking for old people and children, so we made a false <span class="DLF">door</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="827">It was dark, upstairs, old shabby <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so we...we...we...uh...made a double 3 <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="828">Nobody knew, but somebody...there's always trouble-makers.</sentence><sentence id="829">And there were people which were sympathizing with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="830">They figured they survive.</sentence><sentence id="831">So one guy came and he said, "This is not...this is a false <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">There's somebody in there."</sentence><sentence id="833">So he...the Gestapo said, "No, that's no false."</sentence><sentence id="834">And he said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="835">And they busted the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="836">And my mother was in there.</sentence><sentence id="837">And my sister-in-law was in there, and the little child was in there.</sentence><sentence id="838">But that little child was so sharp, each time he heard noise he jumped into a big pot and put a cover over it so nobody knew he was there.</sentence><sentence id="839">He survived.</sentence><sentence id="840">My mother survived.</sentence><sentence id="841">When they came in...the police came in...there was some Jewish police came with them.</sentence><sentence id="842">And the Jewish police knew my brothers, so they start screaming, "Where's the old lady?</sentence><sentence id="843">Where's the old lady?"</sentence><sentence id="844">So I says, "Aw, you got the wrong information."</sentence><sentence id="845">He walked out.</sentence><sentence id="846">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="847">And this

into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2016">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> wasn't cleaned for 5 years, so the odor and the salami sandwich sort of the
