<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: And you can look at me, rather than right into the lens?</sentence><sentence id="5">Okay?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: We're really going to start where you want.</sentence><sentence id="11">You said you didn't have any particular vivid memories of when you first arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: Well, you wanted to talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence><sentence id="15">I will just add perhaps, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: Iam the youngest of three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="17">My older sister Anna, my second sister Chris, and I were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, while our father was in an adjacent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the men, also out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">Mother was no longer with us, because she was taken away two years prior while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, was being cleared of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="19">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, our basic existence consisted of practically the same route so to say, as those other people who had arrived from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">Namely, we were tattooed right at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">We were fortunate enough to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> so as to get consecutive numbers.</sentence><sentence id="22">My older sister received the first, my middle sister the next, and I received the third.</sentence><sentence id="23">Because we then realized, that if we are to be given numbers, we will probably be referred to as numbers from now on.</sentence><sentence id="24">And every time a number is called, we might be lucky to have it called in sequence and remain together.</sentence><sentence id="25"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> basically was the same as I said for the women, the same experience.</sentence><sentence id="26">We were in quarantine for a month.</sentence><sentence id="27">We were doing work that was no work.</sentence><sentence id="28">It was just carrying a rock from one end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the next, and back, just in order to exhaust us.</sentence><sentence id="29">The food was awful, it was meager.</sentence><sentence id="30">We stood on roll call.</sentence><sentence id="31">All the things that were happening to the Starachowice group of women was happening to us.</sentence><sentence id="32">In October 1942, October 27th to be precise, there was a general round up of everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">The Germans came around knocking heavily on the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, "alle raus"," and we were supposed to go to the square.</sentence><sentence id="34">Mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the time with my father and I.My two older sisters were not in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the time, because they secured a job in one of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And they were working on the night shift.</sentence><sentence id="36">Therefore they were kept over.</sentence><sentence id="37">Nobody was let out of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> for the selection.</sentence><sentence id="38">Only people " Anna Wilson ?</sentence><sentence id="39">Everybody out (German) who remained in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were chased out.</sentence><sentence id="40">I remember that I was a very, very skinny kid, and tall, but very slim.</sentence><sentence id="41">And my mother made me -- she made me heavier, and she put breasts on me out of some rags, and she gave me rouge to make me look older and more mature.</sentence><sentence id="42">And I remember we did put on more clothing then necessary, even though that was -- that was October, and it was still rather warm.</sentence><sentence id="43">Because we really didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="44">And when we came -- we were driven, there were already a lot of auxiliary German police, and the Latvians -- who were helping out, and the Ukrainians -- who were helping out at that particular time of the round up.</sentence><sentence id="45">And I do remember seeing horrible things on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> where the selection was to take place.</sentence><sentence id="46">They would grab children, and smash them against <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">And people who couldn't move fast enough were beaten mercilessly.</sentence><sentence id="48">And when we finally reached the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> where the selection was to begin, my mother noticed a lady who was an older lady, who was -- she was very friendly with.</sentence><sentence id="49">And she was sort of helping her out.</sentence><sentence id="50">The lady's name was Kazimierska, Mrs. Kazimierska.</sentence><sentence id="51">And she was elderly, and couldn't walk too well, and mother took her by the arm and stood with her.</sentence><sentence id="52">My father of course was pointed to the group where the men were.</sentence><sentence id="53">And I was pointed -- I was near my mother.</sentence><sentence id="54">But mother was pointed with Mrs. Kazimierska in this other group, and I was pointed in another group.</sentence><sentence id="55">Obviously, I had no idea who was in which group.</sentence><sentence id="56">Soon enough we were put in a formation, and made to walk.</sentence><sentence id="57">And we walked -- I was of course walking with the women.</sentence><sentence id="58">And we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, that was within the premises of the <span class="REGION">Starachowice area</span>, where the Nazis were establishing a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> for slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="59">Because in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> run by the Germans for which they needed forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="60">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Strzelnica</span> I soon discovered that mother was not there.</sentence><sentence id="61">Only father was there.</sentence><sentence id="62">Because we were grouped men and women separately.</sentence><sentence id="63">I had no idea where my two sisters were, but I did know that if they are "gainfully," quote unquote, "occupied", they would be saved.</sentence><sentence id="64">Well, we subsequently found out -- and when I mean subsequently, I mean many years later after the war -- that the selection that took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> was destined for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, and that is where my mother perished.</sentence><sentence id="65">Very soon my two sisters were sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> within the <span class="REGION">Starachowice area</span>, and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">And now, the Nazis were running two separate camps.</sentence><sentence id="67">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>, and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">Most people were employed in the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">The highest echelon of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were the Germans, and everybody else taking care of us were the Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="70">They were the guards, they were the people who conducted the <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> going to work, and from work.</sentence><sentence id="71">And they were brutal, absolutely brutal.</sentence><sentence id="72">Well, I don't quite remember how long the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Strzelnica</span> existed.</sentence><sentence id="73">I do know that the typhus -- a terrible typhus epidemic broke out, that I had typhus.</sentence><sentence id="74">But I do remember subsequently these two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were joined.</sentence><sentence id="75">And this is where I got reunited with my two sisters and my father.</sentence><sentence id="76">And from that point on, until late in July of 1944, where the entire single <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka camp</span> was resettled in a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was adjacent to a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">We were together, meaning the women, on the <span class="REGION">women's side</span>, but we were able to see our father.</sentence><sentence id="78">And personally, I was terribly dependent on my sisters, because I absolutely and truly had no initiative and I had no idea of how to behave in those circumstances, or what to behave.</sentence><sentence id="79">I truly gave myself up to their care, and they became my surrogate mother in really more than one way.</sentence><sentence id="80">From that last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which did not really last too long, we were loaded on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that were brought there and shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">It was either the end of July, or very early August of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="83">As we were being unloaded we realized when we stood on the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was adjacent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">men's train</span> in which my father was.</sentence><sentence id="84">And we still saw our father on that <span class="DLF">railroad platform</span> and he saw us.</sentence><sentence id="85">And that was as I said, probably the beginning of August.</sentence><sentence id="86">We never saw our father again after that.</sentence><sentence id="87">And we found out after the war from people -- we never saw our father again after that. [</sentence><sentence id="88">Pause in proceedings]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Can you go back a couple sentences?</sentence><sentence id="166">You got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: We got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> happened to be adjacent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> in which the men traveled.</sentence><sentence id="170">So, when we were discharged from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> onto the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, we did notice our father in that group of men who descended from the adjacent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and that was the last time we saw our father.</sentence><sentence id="171">He was taken into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with the men, we went with the women.</sentence><sentence id="172">And after the war we found out that father totally lost his -- you have to answer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Just wait.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: It's all in a days work.</sentence><sentence id="180">I'm sorry. [</sentence><sentence id="181">Technical conversation]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="186">Let's just go from what you learned about your father after the war.</sentence><sentence id="187">What happened to him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="191">[Technical conversation]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: You remember the tapes of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">apple</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: You know the most amazing thing to me is, I am very particular about cleanliness of food.</sentence><sentence id="196">I don't even eat in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>, unless I come in and smell the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and look it over.</sentence><sentence id="197">And of course the apple, that was the apple -- I hadn't seen an apple I'm sure for a few years.</sentence><sentence id="198">And this was the absolute find.</sentence><sentence id="199">And I always say to myself, "How was it that I ate that core, that leftover core without thinking: Who ate it?</sentence><sentence id="200">Who threw it away?</sentence><sentence id="201">Who spat on it?</sentence><sentence id="202">What dog made on it?"</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: It's called "starvation."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: Yes, well--</sentence></p><p><sentence id="214">[Pause in proceedings]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: The job for which we were picked was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brzezinka</span> within the confines of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in a self-contained unit called Effektenkammer", That unit consisted of a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, which kept in very specifically assigned bags, numbered bags, the personal belongings of the political prisoners -- non-Jewish, political prisoners -- who were imprisoned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">We were to guard it with our lives almost, because there wasn't ever anything to be missed, or mislaid.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">There was to be no pin transferred from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="218">Those were bags that were hung up on racks with numbers.</sentence><sentence id="219">And whenever a political prisoner perished, his personal belongings were packed in a box.</sentence><sentence id="220">We were taught how to package it, and mail it out.</sentence><sentence id="221">This job was absolutely a godsend.</sentence><sentence id="222">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we were a totally self contained unit, separated from everything else by barbed wire.</sentence><sentence id="223">We lived <span class="NPIP">indoors</span> and worked <span class="NPIP">indoors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">We did not have to go to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="225">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> that cooked whatever meager provisions there were, but at least it wasn't the same kind of starvation diet that was prevailing at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper.</sentence><sentence id="226">And the unit was run basically by Polish women, Christian women.</sentence><sentence id="227">And apparently the 30 women who were dismissed from this job, who were replaced, because there was some contact with them and the Polish underground.</sentence><sentence id="228">So actually, somebody's misfortune turned out to be our great, great fortune, because for the duration of the stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- we're now talking about November or December, very bitter cold -- we were spared going to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and standing in the cold water.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="229">And meanwhile of course, January rolled around, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was being evacuated, and we with it.</sentence><sentence id="230">Luckily enough, we were dressed not in rags, but we had clothing on us that could keep us warm.</sentence><sentence id="231">And we were then driven on a march toward <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, that were somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="232">There were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> somewhere, but I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="233">Because at that point much as I was trying to be very independent, not to be a burden to my sisters, I always knew they were really looking out for my benefit.</sentence><sentence id="234">But right here, I just could not overcome my physical person.</sentence><sentence id="235">Meaning we were marched without stopping, and without sleeping, in the snow.</sentence><sentence id="236">And I completely and totally separated myself in sleep, from the reality, the prevailing reality, the march.</sentence><sentence id="237">And my sisters to this day tell me, and I know it for a fact, I never would</sentence></p><p><sentence id="238">&gt; <span class="INT_SPACE">Personal effects chamber</span> (German); <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for confiscated belongings of prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="239">have survived if they had not pulled me through that march.</sentence><sentence id="240">I think that lasted for almost a week.</sentence><sentence id="241">It was day and night.</sentence><sentence id="242">And I remembered the hallucination, that is the only thing that I really remember.</sentence><sentence id="243">There was a white <span class="DLF">road</span>, and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on both ends, both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">And it seemed to me like I was in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>, because it was white and dark.</sentence><sentence id="245">And that I was in some kind of an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>, that was a total fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="246">But I actually lived that fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="247">And as a matter of fact, after a number of hours -- I don't know how many -- when we stopped, everybody was told to relieve themselves right where they stood.</sentence><sentence id="248">And my sisters told me to relieve myself, and I absolutely couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="249">Because you see I was in that other <span class="NPIP">reality</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">And it just did not -- did not yet match up with my physical person.</sentence><sentence id="251">So, that what actually happened was, as Chris my sister told me, I slept through that march.</sentence><sentence id="252">And we would just fall by the wayside, and stop at <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="253">Anyway, we finally reached that particular <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, or whatever it was, a <span class="DLF">siding</span>, I couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="254">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that we were loaded on were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span>, but they were open.</sentence><sentence id="255">I forgot the name, I think they are called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal trains</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="256">And they were sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> on them or on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="257">[Telephone rings]</sentence></p><p><sentence id="258">[Technical conversation]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: And Chris was telling me it was like an overnight type of stop, and they found me.</sentence><sentence id="260">And that I remembered.</sentence><sentence id="261">Well, the march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the middle of January or thereabouts, going west, which was the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a horrendous experience for me personally, I fell asleep during it.</sentence><sentence id="262">And I survived only because I was pulled by my two sisters, who insisted that I walk.</sentence><sentence id="263">That I sit down when we're told to sit down.</sentence><sentence id="264">Who directed my physical motions as needed.</sentence><sentence id="265">Just so that I would make it through.</sentence><sentence id="266">And actually I do remember the hallucinations that I had at that time, where reality was -- the present reality was fiction, and my imaginary reality was the reality according to what which I acted.</sentence><sentence id="267">Be that as it may, that was a horrendously difficult trip because of the winter snow.</sentence><sentence id="268">They were killing people right along the way if you did not march in <span class="DLF">line</span>, if you sat down for a minute.</sentence><sentence id="269">People just falling like flies.</sentence><sentence id="270">And we finally made it, whether it was to a <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="271">But there were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: You got hit once, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: What happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: I got hit once during the march when we were for the night somewhere or other, they were -- we were chased into a huge <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and everybody was supposed to get in and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="292">At any rate, I didn't move fast enough, and I was hit right on the face -- whether it was with the butt of the rifle, or with a shoe, or whatever it was -- and I fell down, since I was asleep anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="293">I just fell down, and I never moved.</sentence><sentence id="294">And the next thing when I woke up, and the commotion started, I found myself at the very edge of that big <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> where as everybody else was <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">And I realized that I'm alone.</sentence><sentence id="296">And I had the presence of mind to pick myself up and stand at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and see who was exiting.</sentence><sentence id="297">And I found my two sisters that way.</sentence><sentence id="298">And of course I imagined that perhaps my hallucinations lessened because of that short sleep.</sentence><sentence id="299">However, we did make it to that string of open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in which we were seated.</sentence><sentence id="300">And the fortunate thing that happened was, the snow started falling.</sentence><sentence id="301">And because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was open, we were covered with the snow.</sentence><sentence id="302">And you know, in every misfortune, there is a good fortune.</sentence><sentence id="303">While it was cold, we were huddled with a mass of humanity, with women obviously.</sentence><sentence id="304">But we had moisture to drink.</sentence><sentence id="305">We would scrape the snow off the faces, and off the coats, and off the clothes, and eat it.</sentence><sentence id="306">And Chris even reminded me, that we took with us a bit of sugar from our last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we mixed the sugar together with the snow, and that sustained us until we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="307">We did not know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="308">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled up, we were all covered with snow, and there was this big sign that said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">We never heard of it, at least I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="310">We were unloaded right there on to the snow.</sentence><sentence id="311">Not the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, but it was sort of a snow area, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="312">And we were told to stay there right on the snow.</sentence><sentence id="313">Apparently by that time, all the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were being emptied, and people were being collected inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> completely overflowing with humanity, for which they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for all these people that were coming in.</sentence><sentence id="315">So, we were held in that <span class="REGION">area</span> which must have been some kind of grassy knoll, but this was now covered with snow.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I do remember when we were finally taken into a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>, when we left, the whole white <span class="REGION">area</span> was covered with feces and urine of course, because we sat there and people had to relieve themselves.</sentence><sentence id="317">And we came into a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> with free standing -- free standing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> to stay on.</sentence><sentence id="318">It was absolutely the worst, most disorganized of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camps</span> that we have seen up to that point, because there was just too impossible to accommodate all that humanity.</sentence><sentence id="319">Life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> was absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">There was no work to go to, there was just counting in and out, counting and sitting around, and being squashed by people.</sentence><sentence id="321">Finally, they said that there might be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> going out.</sentence><sentence id="322">And as I said before, I had very little to do with my own survival.</sentence><sentence id="323">But my sisters decided that whatever happened, "If there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, we've got to get on it.</sentence><sentence id="324">Wherever it's going it doesn't matter, because nothing could be worse than this particular situation, which is beyond description."</sentence><sentence id="325">And so, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came up, and we got loaded on.</sentence><sentence id="326">And I don't remember how long we drove, but I guess it was quite a number of hours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and that name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">And that was a totally empty <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">There was nobody there, and they took, I don't remember how many, it was not as big as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="329">And because we were among the first to alight from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> we were lined up and we were given jobs.</sentence><sentence id="330">And the SS women who were supervising that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> these camp women had their own lodgings there.</sentence><sentence id="331">We were lucky enough, I got a job as a maid for one of the SS women to clean her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">My sister from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, Anna, was assigned to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, to clean an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">And Chris, I forgot what kind of job she got.</sentence><sentence id="334">But she reminded me of it.</sentence><sentence id="335">That the woman for whom I cleaned her <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- this German woman -- took a liking to me.</sentence><sentence id="336">And she decided she was going to be good to me, and leave me the crust of her bread on a piece of paper because she wouldn't come near.</sentence><sentence id="337">She kept leaving it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and the crust of her bread on a piece of paper, because she wouldn't come near.</sentence><sentence id="338">And she kept leaving it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> the crust of bread and going.</sentence><sentence id="339">And one day she asked me if I'm getting the crust of bread.</sentence><sentence id="340">And I said, "Yes, but I'm sharing it with my sister because she doesn't have a good job and could she get a job <span class="NPIP">indoors</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="341">And Chris was assigned to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">And subsequently, because they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners, they housed us underneath the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, so that we would not be mixed with the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, however big or small it was, for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice, or whatever, we would be clean to serve them.</sentence><sentence id="343">And this is now April.</sentence><sentence id="344">And I distinctly remember that I found out that President Roosevelt died.</sentence><sentence id="345">Truly, I just knew that President Roosevelt was some great, wonderful president somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">But somehow one of the prisoners heard on a radio or whatever it was, that president Roosevelt died, so I think he died in early April.</sentence><sentence id="347">Soon after, the bombing started, the allies were bombing that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow camp</span>, because this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was basically located near some kind of an <span class="DLF">airfield</span>, or Air Force whatever.</sentence><sentence id="348">And the women who were brought after us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that followed were assigned to <span class="DLF">digging ditches</span> for anti-aircraft, you see.</sentence><sentence id="349">And so it happened that the bombs were falling ever more thicker, and all of a sudden we were told to pack up for the German women, because we were going to leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">Not knowing which <span class="NPIP">way</span> or however.</sentence><sentence id="351">But we had to line up again.</sentence><sentence id="352">Again in formation, except that this time those of us who worked as maids had to carry the belongings of the SS women, because they were also evacuating.</sentence><sentence id="353">And I remember distinctly, we walked not very long, until we got to a big <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">And there was this most incredible thing.</sentence><sentence id="355">First of all we were handed rations of food from the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">It was -- we don't know how, there was Swedish Red Cross was handing out rations.</sentence><sentence id="357">And these German women were grabbing all the cigarettes, and grabbed all the cigarettes and packed them in their own bags.</sentence><sentence id="358">But we had rations.</sentence><sentence id="359">I remember distinctly my first sardines came in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span> in those rations.</sentence><sentence id="360">As soon as we found ourself on the main <span class="DLF">highway</span>, there was a totally new -- a new situation for which we were not prepared.</sentence><sentence id="361">Because we really did not know the progress of the war.</sentence><sentence id="362">We were in the eye of the storm, but we never knew what was happening, of who was winning or losing the war, or how the war was progressing.</sentence><sentence id="363">We just knew the misery of people dying constantly.</sentence><sentence id="364">And we finally knew that President Roosevelt had died, but was neither here nor there.</sentence><sentence id="365">Because that did not reflect on our personal reality.</sentence><sentence id="366">We found ourself on that <span class="DLF">highway</span>, which had civilians, it had cows, it had horses, it had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>, it had soldiers in uniform, out of formation.</sentence><sentence id="367">It had soldiers in uniform in formation.</sentence><sentence id="368">It had -- it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced labor on <span class="DLF">German farms</span> during the war, who were also mixed into this mix.</sentence><sentence id="369">And us walking with painted, heavily painted white "X's".</sentence><sentence id="370">It was a white enamel type paint that they painted our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="371">An "X" in the front, and an "X"" in the back, right through my coat.</sentence><sentence id="372">In fact, I had the coat after the war.</sentence><sentence id="373">And when we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I had it redone.</sentence><sentence id="374">It was fantastic material, but it had that horrible cross.</sentence><sentence id="375">But anyhow--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: What was the cross for?</sentence><sentence id="462">Was it to identify you as--</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Did you get anything to eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span>?</sentence><sentence id="470">Was there food there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: Oh, practically nothing.</sentence><sentence id="474">Practically nothing, because it was totally disorganized, you see.</sentence><sentence id="475">You didn't eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but you had that water, or watery coffee, or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: You Just told me -- I'm sorry, you were saying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at least what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> though the food was meager, less than meager, it was doled out with a system.</sentence><sentence id="482">In other words, whatever watery coffee you got in the morning, it was there at all times.</sentence><sentence id="483">And the same whatever, horrible stuff they gave you that was soup.</sentence><sentence id="484">It was not soup, it was sand and some piece of turnip for a caldron of soup.</sentence><sentence id="485">That was at least what you expected to get, and you got.</sentence><sentence id="486">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, because of the total inhuman influx of people for which they were not prepared, or perhaps they didn't want to plan, or as I said, I did not know the realities of the war to account for that.</sentence><sentence id="487">It was just total <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, disorganized <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">This is why we really volunteered for that trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span>, which we didn't know where they was taking us.</sentence><sentence id="489">Every selection was another selection.</sentence><sentence id="490">Every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> could have, as I said, ended in death.</sentence><sentence id="491">But we were desperate enough, and not so much my plans, but my sisters", they made the plans, and they decided "better out than in for staying."</sentence><sentence id="492">So when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span>, we had these indoor jobs, and we didn't freeze anymore.</sentence><sentence id="493">And we sort of recouped our strength to the point again, where we are able to withstand whatever horror was going to come our way.</sentence><sentence id="494">And when we were driven onto the <span class="DLF">road</span> when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> the bombing increased, Allied bombs increased.</sentence><sentence id="495">And of course maybe someday I'll tell you the reaction to bombing of people in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, where different people reacting to bombing all of the time.</sentence><sentence id="496">One was washing herself all the time.</sentence><sentence id="497">One was rubbing her hands.</sentence><sentence id="498">Anyhow -- but that is another story.</sentence><sentence id="499">That is sort of like a vignette that probably --.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="519">Q: No, tell us the story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="521">A: It's very interesting, because we lived under where we worked, where we served the German women.</sentence><sentence id="522">We lived under this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in sort of like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="523">And every time the bombs started falling, and we somehow had a feeling that things are going to end very soon.</sentence><sentence id="524">And some people, some of the women were petrified, they won't make it.</sentence><sentence id="525">One of them had an obsessive -- completely obsessive kind of a behavior.</sentence><sentence id="526">She would grab a bucket of water, and she kept washing herself.</sentence><sentence id="527">It was absolutely unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="528">And whatever made her do it, and of course some people sat in corners and prayed, and some people sang.</sentence><sentence id="529">Some people were singing songs.</sentence><sentence id="530">Some people were having hysterics, because the bombs were so very, very near.</sentence><sentence id="531">And I guess we were affected by it, never thinking that the Germans were probably more scared than we were, because we had by now gone through living <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, and this was just one more thing that was in the scheme of things, wasn't such a tremendous -- you know, it's not a tremendous problem.</sentence><sentence id="532">It was only bombs, you know, from which you die either way.</sentence><sentence id="533">It isn't starvation, or death, or all this dirt and being eaten by lice and bedbugs.</sentence><sentence id="534">This is not the same category.</sentence><sentence id="535">And indeed -- they were indeed scared, because very, very soon after we were evacuated, and found ourselves on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="536">Before that as I mentioned, we were given Swedish Red Cross rations, and we found ourselves on the <span class="DLF">road</span> with all that population, with the mix of humanity, of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, and cattle, and horses, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and Germans, and Poles, and workers, and POWs, and us being marked with a white enamel cross on our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="537">Not a cross, it was an "X" rather on both ends.</sentence><sentence id="538">Well, at one point the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were so packed, that the women who were guarding us said we have to sit down, because there is no way to move.</sentence><sentence id="539">We sat at the <span class="DLF">roadside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">And meanwhile, they got over to the side to talk with other SS women who were guarding other groups.</sentence><sentence id="541">And one of the women, of the girls who served as a maid as I did, who carried the rucksack for the German women said, "Hey, I speak German very well."</sentence><sentence id="542">She was blonde.</sentence><sentence id="543">I think she must have been 20 or 21.</sentence><sentence id="544">A mature girl.</sentence><sentence id="545">She said, "After all I am blonde, and I speak German very well.</sentence><sentence id="546">Why couldn't I impersonate her?"</sentence><sentence id="547">And the group around her, we were 12 of us around her including her, decided, "Yes, in this madness of this mix, how could you tell, except that we had our clothes that was marked?"</sentence><sentence id="548">You see, if we were just in regular clothes, we could have mixed as the population, the civilian population.</sentence><sentence id="549">And she took out from the German woman's bag her cape.</sentence><sentence id="550">And they used to wear like a garrison cap, you know, one of those German hats.</sentence><sentence id="551">She put that on, and she said, "You know what we're going to do, we're going to detach ourself.</sentence><sentence id="552">I will be your guard.</sentence><sentence id="553">If we're found out, I will say we just got lost in this melee, and I was trying to protect these prisoners, and we just got stuff mixed up."</sentence><sentence id="554">And we slowly slid down like it was like an <span class="DLF">embankment</span>, 12 of us with this Halina.</sentence><sentence id="555">Her name was Halina.</sentence><sentence id="556">I have no idea what her last name was.</sentence><sentence id="557">Perhaps I knew and forgot, but her name was Halina.</sentence><sentence id="558">She was a Polish Jewish girl.</sentence><sentence id="559">There were Russian girls, and Polish girls, because this was really such along way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and out of all these selections, that the group was extremely mixed.</sentence><sentence id="560">Anyhow, we slid down that <span class="DLF">embankment</span>, and went into the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">And anyway, the night came, so we decided to stay over and see 0 what happened.</sentence><sentence id="562">Anyhow, next morning we got up, and we saw some men working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> nearby.</sentence><sentence id="563">And we were going that way, not knowing which way, east, west, south, or north.</sentence><sentence id="564">It was just away from that <span class="DLF">road</span> that was now still choked up with all that, and we didn't know where it was going, or what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="565">These men in the <span class="DLF">field</span> were -- excuse me, Polish POWs, Christians who were working on the <span class="DLF">German farms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="566">And as soon as we got to them, they discovered that we speak Polish very well, and some of us were Polish Christians, and Polish Jews, and there was a mixture.</sentence><sentence id="567">And they said, "You know, there's a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, sort of like a little <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> up there.</sentence><sentence id="568">You go there, and tell this woman -- there's a German woman, a servant -- that we sent you and she had to feed you."</sentence><sentence id="569">And we came in, and sure enough the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was deserted by the owners.</sentence><sentence id="570">But there was this old woman, I don't know how old she was, but there was this woman -- German servant -- and she fed us.</sentence><sentence id="571">And we were just absolutely beside ourself with the surprise of it all.</sentence><sentence id="572">And it was this miracle.</sentence><sentence id="573">Of course we didn't know what <span class="NPIP">danger</span> faced us.</sentence><sentence id="574">Because we didn't know whether the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="575">This is now the end of April.</sentence><sentence id="576">We did not know, this is end of April, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="577">Because we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> about two months.</sentence><sentence id="578">So, coming out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in January, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> for two weeks, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> you see.</sentence><sentence id="579">So, we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> about two weeks, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> for about two months, because now it was the end of April 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="639">Q: "45?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="641">A: Yes, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="642">Excuse me, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="643">We had no idea what was really happening, except all of a sudden we noticed Russian uniforms around, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">And not in any victorious fashion as you would imagine sometime, "How am I going to be liberated?</sentence><sentence id="645">Will there be flags flying?"</sentence><sentence id="646">It wasn't anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="647">It was the melee of things, and people, and then these Russians.</sentence><sentence id="648">And the following day, or maybe two days later, they came up to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- that was rather really like a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>, it wasn't an ordinary <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- and they said, "Oh, well that's great.</sentence><sentence id="649">Here's these women, and they speak Russian, and they speak Polish."</sentence><sentence id="650">And they said, "We're going to be coming back in two days, you're going to work for us.""</sentence><sentence id="651">Meanwhile, the word got around they were raping the women.</sentence><sentence id="652">The Russians girls told us.</sentence><sentence id="653">And as soon as they left, we packed up and we left.</sentence><sentence id="654">We left that so called "paradise."</sentence><sentence id="655">We were finding out now that the war was coming to an end.</sentence><sentence id="656">But things were very disorderly, and nobody knew which end was up, and which way was -- which way you should head.</sentence><sentence id="657">We sort of traveled with some of the original 12 women but we scattered, because not everyone had the same idea.</sentence><sentence id="658">We knew that our parents did not survive, but my mother came from a very large family.</sentence><sentence id="659">There were nine children, meaning with families -- nine families.</sentence><sentence id="660">And there was my father's big family, and we were hoping we could get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as fast as we can.</sentence><sentence id="661">We would at least be able to find people who survived, because my grandmother did not live in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="662">1 So that we decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="663">So, that the march started again, because we were way inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="664">I think rather very near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="665"><span class="REGION">Northern Germany</span>, the <span class="REGION">area</span> generally known as <span

class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="667">So we walked as far as a place that was than called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schneidemiihl</span>, now it's called as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pila</span>, it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, now it's in <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="668">So, we were finally able to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was going east.</sentence><sentence id="669">We got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="670">Two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> later we were bumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, because soldiers were coming, and they had preference.</sentence><sentence id="671">So by the time we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span>, we must have been in and out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, waiting to be off one, and on one.</sentence><sentence id="672">And of course we had no idea where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="673">But as long as we were going east, it was in the direction of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">And we were planning on getting back, and see what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="675">Soon, very soon, on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when we were finally seated on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a gentlemen in uniform came over and he heard us speak Polish.</sentence><sentence id="676">Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="677">But he was Jewish, in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="678">He said, "I overheard you talk, and say you're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">I must tell you one thing.</sentence><sentence id="680">Where do you come from?"</sentence><sentence id="681">We said "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>."</sentence><sentence id="682">He said, "You must not go to back to any small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">You will not survive if you do that.</sentence><sentence id="684">What you have to do is go to any

where we don't really know the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and we certainly don't know who is going to be there?"</sentence><sentence id="687">He said, "This you must do."</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: Did any of you ask the man?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Well, the man told us that it's dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="741">The situation is unsettled.</sentence><sentence id="742">This is now early May, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="743">The war was officially over.</sentence><sentence id="744">But things were in great flux because the armies were moving east and west, west and east.</sentence><sentence id="745">And the population shifts during the war as you know, were such that there was just masses of humanity going from hither to yon and back.</sentence><sentence id="746">Because people were resettled, and uprooted, and whatever else.</sentence><sentence id="747">So, he said that would be one thing.</sentence><sentence id="748">Another thing, that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> if you come back, and you might have been a person of means, and had property, that might get in your way.</sentence><sentence id="749">Because you would be suspected of coming to claim your <span class="BUILDING">property</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">If it was real property, or <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="751">And we said, "What are we going to do?</sentence><sentence id="752">We don't know anybody."</sentence><sentence id="753">He said "No, you will go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">If you want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>, my sister lives there."</sentence><sentence id="755">He said he had a sister, and he's going to give us her address.</sentence><sentence id="756">But basically now, the three big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> had Jewish organizations registering people.</sentence><sentence id="757">And it was most important for us to put our name in those <span class="BUILDING">registries</span>, and go there and find out -- day after day -- to find out who else signed in.</sentence><sentence id="758">Because that was the way -- you see the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> was handling some of it.</sentence><sentence id="759">But the masses 2 of uprooted humanity was such that the Jewish Agency* set out its own -- its own well bureau, its own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to register the returning Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">We got to the <span class="BUILDING">sister's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="761">Sure enough, it was in the evening, her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was packed.</sentence><sentence id="762">People were there like herrings, laid out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">Because whoever came back ended up there, and we stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="DLF">stairwell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">I remember, even Chris reminded me of it too.</sentence><sentence id="765">We talked about it, we laughed, because that was a real great welcome.</sentence><sentence id="766">We had absolutely no idea where we were.</sentence><sentence id="767">And it was packed, but people said "Welcome, stay."</sentence><sentence id="768">And they pointed us in the right direction, the Jewish Agency.</sentence><sentence id="769">I think it was the Joint Distribution Committee", or whatever, the Jewish Agency, or international agency.</sentence><sentence id="770">We signed up, and we went.</sentence><sentence id="771">Everyday we were given rations, and you know, provisions to sustain ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="772">And whether we found it on our own, or they somehow assigned to us a <span class="DLF">hovel</span>, that was the most incredible <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="773">It was nothing, but it was a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our heads.</sentence><sentence id="774">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> were falling in, and it was horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="775">However, we were very lucky to discover that Uncle Alexander

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="844">Q: Your Uncle Alexander was the only one of the nine brothers and sisters -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="846">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="847">Mother's family was not Laks, mother's family was Tenenblum(ph).</sentence><sentence id="848">My mother's family was a larger family.</sentence><sentence id="849">Uncle Alexander was my father's brother, and my father had two other sisters about whom we didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="850">One of the daughters of the sister survived in * Jewish Agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>; branch of the World Zionist Organization whose aim is to assist and encourage Jews to foster development

1914.</sentence><sentence id="852">3 <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, her name is Andzia(r).</sentence><sentence id="853">But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived.</sentence><sentence id="854">And we did find out later she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">And we found out from people that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span>, that she taken when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> was being cleared of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="856">And my mother's youngest sister, the pharmacist who worked in <span

graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">We never heard of her.</sentence><sentence id="859">Nobody heard of her, because Lomza was northeast, and that was somehow annexed to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="860">And then the Germans came, and the Russians came, and it was back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="861">And Lomza also had these Jews shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="862">But we don't know whether this younger sister of my mothers ever survived the selection.</sentence><sentence id="863">So, Uncle Alexander in our life at that point was the only surviving relative.</sentence><sentence id="864">When my sisters went back, as I said, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> they were threatened, and something terrible already had happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that same night when they were there.</sentence><sentence id="865">Two women with children who returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, six and eight year old children, and two women -- they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> that same night my sister came.</sentence><sentence id="866">And of course I did not go.</sentence><sentence id="867">I stayed with Uncle Alexander in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">And they went.</sentence><sentence id="869">Of course they did not come back with anything except for some personal gifts that my mother's very dear, dear friend who kept a few mementos, who never even thought she should take things, you know, to hide for us.</sentence><sentence id="870">My two sisters went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and she smuggled them out in the last minute onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to get out.</sentence><sentence id="871">So that was the end of our going back.</sentence><sentence id="872">You know, you can't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, in more ways than one.</sentence><sentence id="873">And that was certainly brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to us at that point, and we stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, and we eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">But again, I would like to add at this point, that I have mentioned it before.</sentence><sentence id="875">Not that I was a coward as a child.</sentence><sentence id="876">But I had nothing to do with my own survival you see.</sentence><sentence id="877">It was either chance, or it was my mother's wonderful wishes for her children to survive.</sentence><sentence id="878">Or whether it was my sisters" efforts to keep us going, or whether it was the support we gave each other.</sentence><sentence id="879">However it was I survived, it was it was none of my doing.</sentence><sentence id="880">It was the, the merest chance.</sentence><sentence id="881">And the most miraculous thing of that, having survived all of that, I sort of made peace with my background in the sense that I have learned going through life that people have other horrible life experiences, people who have never suffered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="882">And because I was able to make a life for myself, and still be educated in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and still be a child in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because I still went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> here, I went to <span

kept telling me, "I will not charge you."</sentence><sentence id="896">deg Andzia Ptasznik 4 Of course those were my childhood days, and really, I was absolutely green about

I said, "Absolutely not, because that is like brown eyes, is a part of my person, so is this number.</sentence><sentence id="900">It is an indelible thing."</sentence><sentence id="901">I live with it.</sentence><sentence id="902">I don't regret not having removed it.</sentence><sentence id="903">I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived, or what I survived.</sentence><sentence id="904">It was just part of a life, but perhaps I was young enough to still catch that little bit of -- because my youth was lost in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you see.</sentence><sentence id="905">And because I was able to recapture some of that childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, it somehow made me feel that this is really the life that counts, even though I lost my

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: My baby teeth never fell out -- and I still had -and my new teeth came in.</sentence><sentence id="986">Because I was undernourished, and my development wasn't -- I was a starved child after the war, after all was said and done.</sentence><sentence id="987">I was tall, but skinny, totally underdeveloped.</sentence><sentence id="988">Totally flat, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board</span>.</sentence><sentence id="989">And two rows of teeth.</sentence><sentence id="990">And when I went to a dentist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, he sat me down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, and he pulled 12 teeth with his hand.</sentence><sentence id="991">You know, one by one.</sentence><sentence id="992">Because they were really ready to come out.</sentence><sentence id="993">But you know, they were -- my physical person, so to say, hadn't yet caught up.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1029">Q: You can rationalize?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: I can, because this is also the nature of your mentality.</sentence><sentence id="1032">I am by nature optimistic and 5 outgoing.</sentence><sentence id="1033">So, that it would not be true to my type to be spending my life regretting what happened, or what didn't happen, or what I went through, or I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1034">I certainly learned a lot from the experiences, even though they're too horrible to recount.</sentence><sentence id="1035">Because human kindness in all that horror was also a very great part of my survival.</sentence><sentence id="1036">There were people who were always taking pity on me, and I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="1037">It was not only my sisters, but also the goodness of other people helped me through.</sentence><sentence id="1038">You know, people would give me a potato, or something.</sentence><sentence id="1039">I don't know if I was such a sorry sight, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1040">But I survived thanks to human kindness, and the real great help of my two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Is there anything else that you would like me to elaborate on?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1059">Q: And how a whole culture died?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: Iam angry what happened to the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1062">What horror happened, what unspeakable horror that could not even be described.</sentence><sentence id="1063">That could not even be comprehended.</sentence><sentence id="1064">That genocide on that scale, that is most unprecedented.</sentence><sentence id="1065">My parents were dearest to me indeed, but the thousands and thousands of others.</sentence><sentence id="1066">My big extended family they were tremendous family, and they were such lovely people, and they were such educated people.</sentence><sentence id="1067">And I grieve for my parents, indeed I did.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And I was wonderful -- terribly attached to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I was the youngest, and rather spoiled, and was very attached to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1070">But as you read history, and study the whole -- the whole scene that has unfolded in the second war that was never even contemplated, or one step from the next, was the more horrible step from the next.</sentence><sentence id="1071">And you never knew who the horror came from, or where the goodness came from, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1072">And yet, the other people were not treated the way we were.</sentence><sentence id="1073">You see, when I always think of those pillows airing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, where there was real normal life, when we were at the edge of total destruction.</sentence><sentence id="1074">And the fact that you had to witness the most animalistic traits of human nature that you would never suspect people displayed.</sentence><sentence id="1075">Because anybody, there were people who felt that they could trample you to death if they could grab that one leftover potato, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1076">That was on the one hand.</sentence><sentence id="1077">You saw the basest nature of the human person at its worst, and than you also saw the most wonderful qualities of people; of devotion, and people who shielded you, who cared about you, and who consoled you.</sentence><sentence id="1078">And after all, I was a child and I needed a lot of consolation, and a lot of good deeds to push me through, aside from my sisters, who weren't in such wonderful shape themselves to do it, but they did it.</sentence><sentence id="1079">When you assess the -- it was a trauma.</sentence><sentence id="1080">But when you assess the whole problem, the whole experience of a huma-- of 6,000,000 people you see, and than you fit yourself, that one single person who was really a child into that framework, it boggles the mind, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Therefore, if 1 chose to contemplate or live that past, I probably 6 would have been a burden forever after.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And my only and one desire after we were liberated was to never ever be a burden to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1083">That was one thing, because I realized then I was an <span class="BUILDING">orphan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1084">And although I was pulled through by my sisters, of course it didn't happen, because when Miles married Chris, I became another -- a charge of his you see.</sentence><sentence id="1085">So, even though I was really always being considered a child, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I came with a children's group, with Miles and Chris, but as a child.</sentence><sentence id="1086">All this is fine.</sentence><sentence id="1087">But you see again having that optimistic nature, I felt that grieving over my own past would not get any me anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1088">Beside, I had not lived.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I had not lived.</sentence><sentence id="1090">When I was given a chance to live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1091">Having that wonderful experience to go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, it was -- I just fell in with it.</sentence><sentence id="1092">This was just the most wonderful thing I could ever dream about.</sentence><sentence id="1093">I guess -- am | angry?</sentence><sentence id="1094">I can't tell you whether I'm angry.</sentence><sentence id="1095">I grieve about it, and I think about it.</sentence><sentence id="1096">But it can't be brought back.</sentence><sentence id="1097">But I hope it's going to be forever remembered, and prevented from happening again.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So that is my only hope.</sentence><sentence id="1099">If our experience could teach the world anything at all about human nature, and about how people can be -- how people can actually -- the bestiality of one man to another, if people could just learn that, than my experience was worth it.</sentence><sentence id="1100">To have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen, so that it does not happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Because if we don't learn from this particular experience, it will probably happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1102">It's something to work on, not just to think about.</sentence><sentence id="1103">You know, to work on for a better world.</sentence><sentence id="1104">But at this point it doesn't look like it, but who knows.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1163">Q: So there were two incidents that you remember particularly clearly about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1165">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1166">Those were during that particular march from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>, where we were to clear the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and the underbrush alongside the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">And because that was a rather lengthy march, in formation with guards guarding us, we did pass quite a number private <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> along the way, because we were basically outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1168">Whereas, whether these <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> were for Germans who were taking care of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> whether these were Polish people who occupied it, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1169">However, they really were private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and on one of the marches I notices pillows airing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1170">And that really was a very painful moment, because in normal conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> everybody was airing pillows.</sentence><sentence id="1171">That was just the thing to do if you lived normal life.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And it brought to mind, that here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents, forever probably, and being left alone, not knowing of our future, working under most horrendous conditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life, airing their pillows, even in such close proximity to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where all these horrible things are happening.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And somehow or other, that particular scene reminded my mind, because you know how you sometimes remain with a picture in your mind, well that was the observation that struck me at that time and remained for me ever after.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And a similar incident, from that particular walk -- march rather, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and back, which we did everyday while we were working on that, on that job -- is that one day, whether we were going or coming back I don't remember, but I did notice an eaten apple of a core on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> as we were passing.</sentence><sentence id="1175">I bent down and picked it up and quickly ate it.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And I was myself amazed that I have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1177">That I was -- the hunger that overpowered the even second thought, "Should I pick up this core?"</sentence><sentence id="1178">Because after all it was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and it could have been thrown away by some sick person, and it could have been the, the -- god only knows, dogs could have been over it and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1179">It absolutely never entered my mind.</sentence><sentence id="1180">There was this little bit of apple left on the core and this is what I grabbed and ate.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1181">And I have very often come back to that, to that -- apple core picture, that picture you know, even in this day when you are always concerned about hygiene and "under what circumstances would you do such and such, and not do such and such?"</sentence><sentence id="1182">Well that is the answer; | did it without any second thought and that was of course probably the only apple I've tasted in more than two years at that point and that was -- there was at least the taste of the apple of the real thing, of that real life that of course I was separate from.</sentence><sentence id="1183">So these two incidents remain very clearly in my mind from this particular work detail in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1184">[Technical conversation]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1185">A: Many times when I go back to these specific memories, to these specific pictures in my mind l always wonder "Living a world of plenty in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where things are discarded constantly 8 and I go back to that episode of that core of an apple, of what that could do to a starving person -- where of course in hindsight and looking from another perspective in a totally different age I look at it now I am really most impressed of how life can change your approach to things.</sentence><sentence id="1186">How life can absolutely move you into another <span class="NPIP">dimension</span> to make you aware of values of certain things even such as an eaten apple core, which of course today you would not ever consider anything but garbage.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Because people though away more things that are not garbage in today's society that we ever dreamt of.</sentence></p></dialogue>
