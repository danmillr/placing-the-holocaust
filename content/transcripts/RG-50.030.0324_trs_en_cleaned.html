<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: What about activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, cultural activities, religion, your father's political --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="174">You were afraid even to go out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could.</sentence><sentence id="175">They used to come in every day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and do what they want to, and a lot of people got killed.</sentence><sentence id="176">If they didn't like somebody, they just killed them in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">It didn't make any difference.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Did you see that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="210">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> without help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, it was very hard to organize anything, especially in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like ours.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Judenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job.</sentence><sentence id="228">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself.</sentence><sentence id="229">I brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: What other privileges did you get from working there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, if I had to go out for something.</sentence><sentence id="236">If you get out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, because you mix with the Gentile people <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you could help yourself a little bit more.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: Were you able to help your family by virtue of your <span class="NPIP">position</span> other than the food?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No, not much.</sentence><sentence id="239">I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the firm.</sentence><sentence id="240">But what happened, the day before they took all the Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the night before.</sentence><sentence id="241">He was caught in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and he was taken away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Was your Judenaut appointed by the local community or by the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Mostly by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="249">They picked one man, and then he picked everybody that he wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="250">Some people that he knew or were close friends of his.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: You hear stories about Judenauts and various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">Some of them were very helpful to the community, some of them were trying to save their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="256">How do you kind of assess how your Judenaut operated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: We knew it was a very difficult time.</sentence><sentence id="261">You have to understand what was going on in those days.</sentence><sentence id="262">You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.</sentence><sentence id="263">If they came in and saw the President of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to supply those 200 people.</sentence><sentence id="264">So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take me?</sentence><sentence id="265">Why not take somebody else?</sentence><sentence id="266">You're put in the position that if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right.</sentence><sentence id="267">I'm sure that you heard that , which was the President, committed suicide because he knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="268">Some people were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="269">They did what they had to do and they made a lot of enemies.</sentence><sentence id="270">In my opinion they really helped a lot of people, too.</sentence><sentence id="271">But you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of people you remember the bad things what a lot of people do.</sentence><sentence id="272">I couldn't say that I think most of them didn't want to do what they did, but they had to do because they were forced to do, because if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would lose their life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Now, you worked in the labor department?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="289">The labor department, for instance, the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="290">They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the register that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day.</sentence><sentence id="291">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work.</sentence><sentence id="292">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: But how were those choices made, which 200?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: They usually were made according the list that we had.</sentence><sentence id="301">The way the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top of them.</sentence><sentence id="302">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="303">I was 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="304">I didn't make the big decisions.</sentence><sentence id="305">They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in <span class="NPIP">place</span> to help them, instead of sending them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go.</sentence><sentence id="315">I mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged.</sentence><sentence id="316">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="317">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier.</sentence><sentence id="318">I imagine everybody did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="319">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them.</sentence><sentence id="320">If I could help somebody else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Were there women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judenaut</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: No, not too many that I can remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut toward other people because of their special power?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="335">There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="341">They used to dispense the food.</sentence><sentence id="342">They used to get it, and then divide it.</sentence><sentence id="343">The people used to have little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week.</sentence><sentence id="344">We also had <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to cook or couldn't help themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: Anything else about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> that you can think of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take you to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="353">They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job.</sentence><sentence id="354">We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right.</sentence><sentence id="355">So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="356">You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on.</sentence><sentence id="357">We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: So, you were already in ?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the building section.</sentence><sentence id="360">It was a very, very big <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">We lived right in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">It was like a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">It was one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factories</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">That's where I got to know my wife over there in 1942 because women and men were in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="365">We lived in separate <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but we were in the same <span

charge, but Ukrainians were watching our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">It was pretty tough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat.</sentence><sentence id="369">We worked but we mixed with other nationalities.</sentence><sentence id="370">The Polish people worked in the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">At night time we used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and still see our friends and everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="372">We tried to help each other as much as we can.</sentence><sentence id="373">Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="374">We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us.</sentence><sentence id="376">I know when they took us away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and told them that , We were very good workers and we know the ammunition, that we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span>, and they should send us to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">They did.</sentence><sentence id="378">Very few of our people, except the older ones were taken away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">The rest of us we got numbers and we were sent away to work.</sentence><sentence id="380">I wasn't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> really too long.</sentence><sentence id="381">I was over there maybe three or four days.</sentence><sentence id="382">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, by the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">conductor trains</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span>, a lot of our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't remember exactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days, but we didn't have any food.</sentence><sentence id="383">We didn't have any water.</sentence><sentence id="384">They didn't give us anything.</sentence><sentence id="385">We didn't have any facilities even in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and because we were people that already came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, we didn't have any luggage with us, or any valuables.</sentence><sentence id="387">They chased us out from there and we went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, and luckily it was showers and not gas.</sentence><sentence id="388">We came out from there and they numbered us and they put us in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">Then, people came in from <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> because the Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> and they needed people to replace them at their <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, so they needed workers.</sentence><sentence id="390">So they came in from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, this is from the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> and they said they need sheet metal men.</sentence><sentence id="391">I didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of Coopersmith.</sentence><sentence id="392">He passed away, he survived and lived in <span class="REGION">California</span> and they said Sam, when they ask for sheet metal men, why don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal man.</sentence><sentence id="393">You're very handy, you'll go with me.</sentence><sentence id="394">We'll see that you do something, but God's will they picked him and sent him to a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> and they sent me into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work in the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I didn't know what to do, but then I tried to take the broom and keep the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> very clean, which it was a very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="396">There was about 6,000 people working over there, but our <span class="REGION">section</span> had maybe 30 people working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and there were three Germans that were running it, so because I kept the <span class="NPIP">place</span> clean, so they figured everything is fine.</sentence><sentence id="397">They took a liking to me.</sentence><sentence id="398">I learned a little bit of trade over there.</sentence><sentence id="399">By the end of 1944 I think it was in November, when the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Russians started progressing more on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and the Germans used to have their <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and they bunked a lot of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, they brought a lot of our men to the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> to be fixed.</sentence><sentence id="400">The soldiers that were in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, came with them.</sentence><sentence id="401">They usually waited until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were fixed, so they put on another shift.</sentence><sentence id="402">Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in.</sentence><sentence id="403">His name was Fox.</sentence><sentence id="404">He said, each one he assigned us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a pullman to go out and check on those pullman.</sentence><sentence id="405">I went out to mine because I didn't know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix.</sentence><sentence id="406">When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift.</sentence><sentence id="407">I couldn't tell the men.</sentence><sentence id="408">I took the bull by the horn.</sentence><sentence id="409">I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift.</sentence><sentence id="410">We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked.</sentence><sentence id="411">Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people.</sentence><sentence id="412">They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">That's where I learned my trade.</sentence><sentence id="414">When I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington DC</span> and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when I came over here.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">And I already knew what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="493">I figured my gosh how can I get out of it.</sentence><sentence id="494">I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught with materials that , which means they are materials they use during the war for war materials, because I used copper.</sentence><sentence id="495">So, I made the decision that when the main commandment came out, we had appeals every morning that we stayed out.</sentence><sentence id="496">I had to come because the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted us almost all the time.</sentence><sentence id="497">I went out and I went down to the main man behind him and I told him that I was making something for him for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="498">I said I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I worked for it for almost two weeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it.</sentence><sentence id="499">It went away, I never heard any thing more about it.</sentence><sentence id="500">They never called me.</sentence><sentence id="501">The commander got to know me very well because we went out through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> a lot of times.</sentence><sentence id="502">He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out.</sentence><sentence id="503">That's how I survived from going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> one time.</sentence><sentence id="504">We had to think sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="505">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was liquidated, my whole family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, and they all perished in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">That's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there.</sentence><sentence id="507">So, I was the only one from the whole family left, from the immediate family, but I had some friends that they brought in from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to , too, and they worked over there.</sentence><sentence id="508">So, we used to meet every day.</sentence><sentence id="509">I think in there must have been about 2,000 or a little bit over 2,000 people over there working.</sentence><sentence id="510">Things were tough.</sentence><sentence id="511">We didn't have enough to eat.</sentence><sentence id="512">There was sicknesses.</sentence><sentence id="513">I had two friends by the name, one of them, that he was sick one of them was and the other one was , and they took them all out one day and they shot them all.</sentence><sentence id="514">They liquidated the whole <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="515">They took everything out.</sentence><sentence id="516">So, you can imagine how we felt.</sentence><sentence id="517">Things were very bad.</sentence><sentence id="518">I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that were going on over there, but that's what they did.</sentence><sentence id="519">They took them all out and shot them at one day.</sentence><sentence id="520">Plus the other things that were going on.</sentence><sentence id="521">We got beatings every day, coming in or going out.</sentence><sentence id="522">The food was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="523">We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.</sentence><sentence id="524">But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in order to keep our <span class="NPIP">things</span> a little bit up.</sentence><sentence id="525">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, it was altogether different.</sentence><sentence id="526">It was hard to believe what was going on over there.</sentence><sentence id="527">We could see the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span>.</sentence><sentence id="528">We could smell the smoke.</sentence><sentence id="529">We knew the people that were taken over there.</sentence><sentence id="530">We were ones of the lucky ones.</sentence><sentence id="531">The minute we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they started chasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then they put us through a solution that we walked through.</sentence><sentence id="532">We didn't even know.</sentence><sentence id="533">We were just like animals.</sentence><sentence id="534">You were chased and you didn't know what was going on to you at that time.</sentence><sentence id="535">Then they put us in <span class="DLF">line</span> and they came out and the doctors mingle and the other ones were in white coats, and they look through and one of them goes to this <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and one of them goes to this <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and one to this <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and one to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="536">Now, I was lucky that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, not really <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">This was part -- they called it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz II</span>.</sentence><sentence id="538">Then them came to make the selections.</sentence><sentence id="539">When they made the selections and I was sent away in those first three days, that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> three or four days.</sentence><sentence id="540">I don't even remember.</sentence><sentence id="541">It's very hard for me to remember.</sentence><sentence id="542">We didn't do any work.</sentence><sentence id="543">We were sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="544">It was cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> until they came at night.</sentence><sentence id="545">Then we used to sleep with 15 people on one , with a little bit of snow.</sentence><sentence id="546">I was glad to get out from there.</sentence><sentence id="547">When they brought us into , which was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, it was the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that we went to, over there, because we worked with different nationalities and we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with a lot of Germans, everybody had a different .</sentence><sentence id="548">We had a straw sack with a little blanket.</sentence><sentence id="549">That's all we had.</sentence><sentence id="550">We slept with about 200 people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="551">But they kept us a little bit cleaner.</sentence><sentence id="552">We had the laundry and the clothes that we were wearing the striped clothes.</sentence><sentence id="553">We had to change because in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> it was grease working around <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">We had to change.</sentence><sentence id="555">We used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and used to change 0 the clothes and they gave us other clothes.</sentence><sentence id="556">But, we had selections every Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="557">They looked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they send them away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">They brought in other people to replace them.</sentence><sentence id="559">The food we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="560">They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was missing, we had to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men were found.</sentence><sentence id="561">Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came out, or something happened, but we had to wait.</sentence><sentence id="562">And if they didn't count us, we didn't couldn't go to work until everything was counted.</sentence><sentence id="563">Then we had about five miles, maybe four miles that we would have to walk from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="564">The music was playing near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread.</sentence><sentence id="566">The bread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we had to eat it because you had to survive on something.</sentence><sentence id="567">We got a little bit, it was like tea.</sentence><sentence id="568">They said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="569">Then in the middle of the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water.</sentence><sentence id="570">Then at night, when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="571">This was our food for a whole day.</sentence><sentence id="572">Things were very, very bad, because a lot of people, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick.</sentence><sentence id="573">The minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we went out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and by the time we got back, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> behind us that they killed off the rest of them.</sentence><sentence id="574">We just loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we walked from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to the thing.</sentence><sentence id="575">The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed them on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then they took them away to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576">But we couldn't help ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="577">We couldn't even escape because on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> there was nobody to help us.</sentence><sentence id="578">I had a friend that escaped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when they took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and when he came back, he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="579">His name was .</sentence><sentence id="580">I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="581">He came back, he said listen don't go on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> because they burn you over there and we thought that the man was crazy.</sentence><sentence id="582">We didn't believe him.</sentence><sentence id="583">We said how can they tell living people and burn them especially you know in our days?</sentence><sentence id="584">And another thing that we couldn't understand it's as if the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught that somebody <span class="NPIP">outside</span> must know because if they would know what was going on in here, they couldn't sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and not do anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="585">But, we never got any help from <span class="NPIP">the outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">When he was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, he said he couldn't stay over there because they wanted to kill him because , so he tried to get back and came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="587">This was in before they took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">That man didn't live through.</sentence><sentence id="589">They took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because he was already on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one time, from , from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="590">He jumped the <span

he was shot.</sentence><sentence id="591">But, when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we realized what the man told us was true, but we couldn't help ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="592"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we had a lot of hope.</sentence><sentence id="593">We could see that 1 this <span class="NPIP">thing</span> couldn't last on forever.</sentence><sentence id="594">But, it was very easy to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="595">All you had to do was through yourself on the wires, because the wires were electric.</sentence><sentence id="596">They had 600 volts in them.</sentence><sentence id="597">And a lot of people did it.</sentence><sentence id="598">But, if we found out that somebody was very despondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell him listen, the outside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not do anything.</sentence><sentence id="599">It looks like the war is already coming to an end.</sentence><sentence id="600">We knew little things what were going on because we didn't have any radios.</sentence><sentence id="601">We didn't have any papers, and nobody was telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> were afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took him away.</sentence><sentence id="602">They took them away, too.</sentence><sentence id="603">So, we tried to help each

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="727">One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they have to take us all out.</sentence><sentence id="728">They didn't take us where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="729">We found out later that this was the death march.</sentence><sentence id="730">We were only about 60 kilometers away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the people that were going met the same way.</sentence><sentence id="731">So, they took us out one morning.</sentence><sentence id="732">It was snowing in January, January the 22nd.</sentence><sentence id="733">It was snowing and it was very cold <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero.</sentence><sentence id="734">We didn't have any clothes.</sentence><sentence id="735">We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the way.</sentence><sentence id="736">One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in , which was a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">They brought us in all over there because the SS that were going with us, they had to rest a little bit too.</sentence><sentence id="738">So, we stayed over and in the middle of the night they started shelling the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">They woke us up about 12:00, 1:00 in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="740">There might have been about 60,000 of us over there because they brought them from all <span class="NPIP">over</span>.</sentence><sentence id="741">They chased us out and I had a dream that night when I was sleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I had an argument with her.</sentence><sentence id="742">I told her listen, how can I not leave.</sentence><sentence id="743">You know we're almost liberated.</sentence><sentence id="744">You see what's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the <span class="NPIP">dream</span>.</sentence><sentence id="745">When I was near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to go out, I had two friends with me, one was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, Weinberg was his name, and the other one was from .</sentence><sentence id="746">When we came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, my dream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go.</sentence><sentence id="747">I'm not going.</sentence><sentence id="748">So, the other one from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, he didn't want to go with me.</sentence><sentence id="749">He said, Sam we're almost liberated I'm going out.</sentence><sentence id="750">I'm going where they chasing us to go.</sentence><sentence id="751">I said no, but the other one, I took care of him.</sentence><sentence id="752">He was a little bit younger and I took care of him a lot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when I was there.</sentence><sentence id="753">So, I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and there was a big <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">It was a <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> over there about three foot thick, and there was a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it that was made from one of the shells or something.</sentence><sentence id="755">I crawled out and there was a <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and I rolled down into the snow with them and we ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we stayed over there for about eight days until the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="756">The Russians liberated us.</sentence><sentence id="757">If you asked me how I survived in those 2 <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember.</sentence><sentence id="758">I know we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the <span

tell you something about .</sentence><sentence id="1030">When we came to , we were one of the first ones to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1031">There were a lot of other nationalities over there, but they all had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go back to.</sentence><sentence id="1032">They had relatives, but the Jews didn't

from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> come back in to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Also, a lot of the people that were in <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1422">A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad.</sentence><sentence id="1423">They are some good people with the bad ones too.</sentence><sentence id="1424">Even there were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and I worked with a German that was running the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1425">It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler too much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought something in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it until I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know, back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, I used to share it with my friends.</sentence><sentence id="1426">The fellow when were in the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a German by the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and then they put him in charge of us.</sentence><sentence id="1427">I also found out later that it was a homosexual which I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in those days, but he also had a girlfriend in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and he spoke German and she spoke only Polish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the <span

id="1428">We went to work, but he stayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night he had this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost difference between life and death, this soup.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And also, in the winter time it was very cold over there, but because we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> an the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running on coal, so we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his pocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when we came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bellie stove</span>, a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron stove</span> and the fellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> didn't mind and everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and we had it a little bit warmer at night.</sentence><sentence id="1430">We were one of the lucky ones maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1431">You had to help yourself a little.</sentence><sentence id="1432">You couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you went through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1433">I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you couldn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="1434">The people that maybe 2 survived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take the clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they sorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1435">If you were picked to do a job you couldn't help it.</sentence><sentence id="1436">You took the people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and put them in the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and it was people like us.</sentence><sentence id="1437">You know, they picked them out and that's what you did.</sentence><sentence id="1438">So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they put you in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and picked somebody else to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1439">So, it wasn't something like just -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I was in they used to hang people every Sunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="1440">They used to pick up people from the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and we used to hang them.</sentence><sentence id="1441">They didn't do it themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1442">Used to go out and put the thing on their neck, but you couldn't help it.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be picked I would have to do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1444">It was one of those things.</sentence><sentence id="1445">Another thing in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold, we had to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="DLF">hole</span> day.</sentence><sentence id="1446">They wouldn't let us go into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and sit <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because we were going to make it dirty.</sentence><sentence id="1447">The <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> are going to be dirty.</sentence><sentence id="1448">We had to make our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> because you knew what was going to happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="1449">I'll never forget I cut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what I did but I put a piece of rope on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and it just healed up and I used to go to work, and I used to be sick.</sentence><sentence id="1450">I used to get a sore throat and a fever.</sentence><sentence id="1451">I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1452">I never stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1453">I figured if I stay I know what's going to happen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, walking, we used to hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my friends were dragging me in until we got in there.</sentence><sentence id="1454">I used to take my friends until we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and that's how I survived.</sentence><sentence id="1455">We helped each other.</sentence><sentence id="1456">If not we wouldn't be here.</sentence><sentence id="1457">Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> it was so bad, but we survived somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1458">It's amazing what a human being can stand when it happens.</sentence><sentence id="1459">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to escape because there was no body that helped a Jew on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Maybe in another <span

<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because most of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> were built in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1462">Even from the <span

time to destroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to.</sentence><sentence id="1464">The <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and everything is over there.</sentence><sentence id="1465">That's why I took the march of the living kids who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1466">It's not only the Jews that
