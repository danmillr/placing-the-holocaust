<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Well, he spoke both.</sentence><sentence id="203">So whatever the circumstances were, he could respond.</sentence><sentence id="204">But the -- most of the time, the people that he dealt with likewise were immigrants from adjoining <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, because <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was a more modern <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it offered greater opportunities than smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, I mean -- not smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, you know, but -- but th -- not as advanced countries.</sentence><sentence id="205">So he would speak -- when he dealt</sentence><sentence id="207">with Gentiles, he spoke German, and with Jewish people, yeah, it was always -- Yiddish was the international language.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: So bef -- before the annexation, when you're still able to go to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">state school</span>, did you take any supplementary, or so-some sort of Jewish classes at the end of the day, or -- or on Sundays, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: No, n-not really.</sentence><sentence id="236">Only training for Bar Mitzvah, where a year ahead of time, I would sit down with someone, not a rabbi, but one of the Hassids, who would teach me the Torah portion that I was supposed to read at my Bar Mitzvah, which</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="243">occurred in *37, actually four months before Hitler came in.</sentence><sentence id="244">And it happened to be a very momentous occasion in my life.</sentence><sentence id="245">You might find it funny, my grandmother was at first a little upset that I would have my Bar Mitzvah staged at the <span class="BUILDING">Klikee(ph) temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">Why?</sentence><sentence id="247">Because the Klikee(ph) <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> had an organ.</sentence><sentence id="248">And having an organ in a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, that -- that was not kosher enough, so she wanted me to have it somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="249">But I liked the Klikee(ph) <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, and I was going there.</sentence><sentence id="250">So I had to tell her that although they have this organ, they never use it.</sentence><sentence id="251">And the only time they use it was on Sundays when on occasion they have a wedding.</sentence><sentence id="252">But the mere fact that the organ was there, that was enough reason for her not to particularly enjoy being there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Since you went to a non-Jewish school until the annexation, did you have any non-Jewish friends?</sentence><sentence id="264">What was the distribution of Jews to non-Jews in your <span class="BUILDING">class</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: In-- from grade one, I experienced anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="268">Six years old, I go into grade one, another kid -- they find out very soon whether you're Christian or not, even at six.</sentence><sentence id="269">And he called me a Christ killer, and you know, I didn't know what that was.</sentence><sentence id="270">I said -- you know, what he was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="271">And -- and it was not -- when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I asked my mother.</sentence><sentence id="272">And she said, oh, pay no attention, or this is something that they're -- where they're taught at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> not to like certain people, but you're gonna hear this, just -- h-he doesn't know what he's saying, so just forget about it.</sentence><sentence id="275">But you mean -- you very soon learn.</sentence><sentence id="276">Later on actually, we would frequently have fights, wh-which -- which occurred mainly when the priests came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and started showing movies.</sentence><sentence id="277">And it dealt -- you saw people with beards, and -- and th-the payos and so forth, so you knew that -- and they showed the crucifixion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Do you remember what grade this was?</sentence><sentence id="291">How old were you when these movies started to be shown?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: I think I--I probably was around eight or nine, a-an-and -- and when class lets out, then we started fights.</sentence><sentence id="295">And many a day I'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a bloody nose because at that time, when somebody hit you, you -- you struck back.</sentence><sentence id="296">And I was never hesitant, so it's oh -- you know, even as I went on to <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span>, you know, I -- somebody said something to me, called me a dirty Jew, you know, I'd let him have it.</sentence><sentence id="297">And you learn that if it's one person, you take him on, but if there's a group, I figured I'd better run.</sentence><sentence id="298">But I was never scared, al-although my mother in particular always told me not to get involved, or -- or -- you know, walk away, run away, but I never did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
