<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: This is an interview with Itka Zygmuntowicz recorded on May 30, 1996.</sentence><sentence id="2">Tape one, side one.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: This is one of my poems that I have written.</sentence><sentence id="4">It's called "The Silent Voice".</sentence><sentence id="5">It is dedicated to all those who's voices have been silenced forever in the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945.</sentence><sentence id="6">I wrote this poem May 11, 1980.When ages of civilization crumble to dust And death is raging supreme When the Devil is crowned by the power of deceit Then freedom is a far away dream.</sentence><sentence id="7">When all that you loved is taken from you And you are stripped to the bare bone When all moral boundaries and laws are broken Then you are in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> with Satan alone.</sentence><sentence id="8">When Jews are depicted as sub-human, as vermin And brute force and evil prevail When Nazi doctors turn children to corpses Then all logic and reason fails.</sentence><sentence id="9">When the whole world remains dead silent With the exception of just a few Then they grant Satan license and opportunity To murder in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> a God-loving Jew.</sentence><sentence id="10">When man and woman are kept apart And new life is not conceived When there is no sound of laughter or song How can God by man be perceived?When mass murder of the Jews becomes legal Under the banner of an ideology or God's sacred name Then its not the victims but the nazi murderers who did not resist Satan and defile God's name.</sentence><sentence id="11">When living skeletons are marching at gunpoint Through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in long columns of five, cold, starved, forced to hard labor What power on earth gave them the strength to survive?When all heads are shaved, all human rights denied And all wear the same kind of striped dress When to worship God becomes a crime Then the whole world is in a very terrible mess.</sentence><sentence id="12">When Hitler's dreams become a reality And the nazi's send Jews to the left and to the right Then such men are not ruled by God's divine power But by their own burning ambition for power and might.</sentence><sentence id="13">When the so-called superior Arian nazi race used all their knowledge, technology and skill To murder 6 million Jews merely for being born Jewish That I don't believe was God, but Hitler's demonic will.</sentence><sentence id="16">That explains a lot to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Why don't we, I'd like to begin by having you tell me your name, date of birth and where you were born, and a little bit about your family.</sentence><sentence id="36">And you might tell me your name now and your name at birth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: My legal name is Itka Zygmuntowicz.</sentence><sentence id="40">I was named after my maternal great-grandmother Itka who was also born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">And my family name, my parents name, was Cim-mo-nella-simon (ph).</sentence><sentence id="42">My family use to call me Yit-cola (ph) In-de-yum-fa-yetska (ph), a name which I like to be called.</sentence><sentence id="43">I was born April 15, 1926 during Passover, the Jewish holiday celebrating .</sentence><sentence id="44">I was the oldest of three siblings.</sentence><sentence id="45">I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, Chair-han-off (ph) <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, located about 90 kilometers north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">At the time when the Nazis came in, I was 13 years old and the population of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, Chair-han-off (ph) <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was about 15,000.</sentence><sentence id="47">A little less than half of that was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="48">My family consisted at that time of my parents, Hymen, my little brother Soo-lick (ph), my little sister Zee-sil (ph) and my maternal widowed grandmother, .</sentence><sentence id="49">My ancestors on my mother's side came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> around the 16" century.</sentence><sentence id="50">Four generations were still alive and each one had a lot of children because they came from an orthodox background.</sentence><sentence id="51">So my grandmother was one of seven siblings.</sentence><sentence id="52">My mother was one of seven siblings.</sentence><sentence id="53">My Aunt who lived also in Chair-han-off (ph) had also seven children.</sentence><sentence id="54">My other Uncle had three children.</sentence><sentence id="55">They all had, the younger ones had less because we didn't have enough opportunity before the war to have more children.</sentence><sentence id="56">So we had a very large family.</sentence><sentence id="57">I feel that both my parents and my grandmother were my first teachers and my first role models.</sentence><sentence id="58">I remember when I was a little girl, my grandmother used, who was an extremely religious woman, observant woman, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we only spoke Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="59">We observed the Jewish laws, customs and traditions.</sentence><sentence id="60">And my grandmother was wearing a shaytle (ph), in Yiddish its called, and it's called a wig in English, but not to beautify herself but for religious purposes.</sentence><sentence id="61">For my grandmother religion was not just a belief, it was a way of life which effected the way she behaved, the way she dressed, the way she taught us.</sentence><sentence id="62">And I remember that every morning when I would get up my grandmother would say with me the prayers and in the evening she would say with me the prayers.</sentence><sentence id="63">She used to give me coins to put in the push-ka (ph), which is called her charity box, and she would tell me, "Yit-cola (ph), to help those who are less fortunate than we are is our mitzvah (ph), our commandment."</sentence><sentence id="64">I remember one time I was still a preschooler, didn't know one coin from another, and a poor man came to our <span class="DLF">door</span> and asked my grandmother for alms.</sentence><sentence id="65">And my grandmother gave me some change, some coins, I had no idea the value of it but I looked in my hand and I said, "Grandma, so much money?"</sentence><sentence id="66">And my grandmother said, "My child, you only have what you give away."</sentence><sentence id="67">I questioned my grandmother's proverb because I couldn't understand it, being so little, how can you give away something and still have it?</sentence><sentence id="68">So my grandma began with a smile and says, "Yit-cola (ph), I only give what God and my parents have given me.</sentence><sentence id="69">I'm not giving mine."</sentence><sentence id="70">This is how she felt.</sentence><sentence id="71">And she taught me lots of Yiddish songs, told me lots of stories.</sentence><sentence id="72">I came from a family of story-tellers.</sentence><sentence id="73">And since, at that time, technology was not developed so much so, and my grandmother had lots of children.</sentence><sentence id="74">In fact, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, my grandmother had five married children, 21 great-children and one great-grandchild.</sentence><sentence id="75">Only one granddaughter, which I'm going to speak about a little later, her name was also Yit-cola (ph).</sentence><sentence id="76">I was eight years old when she emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1934, to get married with somebody who was, without her boyfriend, that she met also in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, Check-han-off (ph), who was from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the same, and he left a little earlier, so she went there to marry him.</sentence><sentence id="77">And I remember that the whole family was gathered and everybody was crying and saying, "God knows if we will see each other</sentence><sentence id="79">again."</sentence><sentence id="80">And my grandmother, who was a woman of very deep faith, tried to comfort us and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), , don't cry.</sentence><sentence id="81">With God all things are possible."</sentence><sentence id="82">I always admired my grandmother's strength because she lived through World War One.</sentence><sentence id="83">She lost a brother, she lost her husband, she lost two of her children, that was before the Holocaust, and she lost a granddaughter.</sentence><sentence id="84">But she never lost her unshakable faith in God.</sentence><sentence id="85">And she always believed and she never questioned.</sentence><sentence id="86">And it seemed to me the more she suffered, the more she believed and the kinder she was, so she was a wonderful role model for me.</sentence><sentence id="87">And she lived with us from the day I was born.</sentence><sentence id="88">And she was the only one in my family who was privileged to die a natural death shortly after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">From early childhood on my parents and grandmother stressed to us children the meaning and importance of , which in English means humanness.</sentence><sentence id="90">Whenever I would do something that didn't measure up to the yardstick of , they never screamed at me, they didn't hit me, but they would explain to me why it's wrong, and usually they would say, "Yit-cola (ph), its not -" Luse to cringe when they said this here because I knew that they disapproved and eventually I started to view myself through that yardstick.</sentence><sentence id="91">You know, when I did something I felt always will my parents approve?But they also, what they did also is that they, when I did something good they used to praise me.</sentence><sentence id="92">And I really felt that they loved me unconditionally and that was a wonderful gift.</sentence><sentence id="93">But they were strict with me.</sentence><sentence id="94">When I was already a school girl, I remember in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very cold winters and some of the kids, and we were wearing old wool socks, stockings I mean, and I don't even remember how they use to hold up but I remember they were always rolling up, they were like you know and the kids didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="95">So a few kids put on knee socks and I wanted to wear knee socks too.</sentence><sentence id="96">So I remember that I asked my parents, can I put on the knee socks?</sentence><sentence id="97">And they said, "Yit-cola (ph), its too cold".</sentence><sentence id="98">And I was naughty and I figured I'm not going to start to convince them, I felt I'm not going to be cold, , so what did I do?</sentence><sentence id="99">I went in and I put the knee socks underneath my stockings and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">My father often used to come to the <span class="DLF">school yard</span> because he had actually two kinds of, first we were in the <span class="BUILDING">dairy business</span>, like <span class="BUILDING">wholesale dairy business</span>, but he was with a partner and obviously I don't know why, whether they, like the partnership dissolved, and then he started to work in photography and picture framing.</sentence><sentence id="101">So he used to travel sometimes and whenever he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or before he left, if I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wasn't far to drop in and sometimes even bring me some goodies or something, just to see me.</sentence><sentence id="102">So that particular morning, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was recess and some of the kids started to say, "Yit-cola (ph), your father is here."</sentence><sentence id="103">And I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="104">I was wearing the knee socks.</sentence><sentence id="105">And my father looked at me, and I'll never forget for as long as I live, that look, and he said, "Yit-cola (ph), I feel very and disappointed in you.</sentence><sentence id="106">Because everybody can make a mistake, but when a person lies, he deliberately deceives you and this is not and I'm very disappointed."</sentence><sentence id="107">And I felt so terrible and I started to cry and ask forgiveness, so he fixed me up and said, I was still not so old yet, and he said to me, I'll never forget it, "Yit-cola (ph), everybody makes a mistake but only a fool makes twice the same.</sentence><sentence id="108">And in everything there is a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="109">So I hope that you have learned, that you cannot lie without becoming a liar and helping other people."</sentence><sentence id="110">The reason I am sharing this story is because I found out later when the Nazis came in, when everything was deception, how important it is to speak the truth and not to lie, and you know how justice is important.</sentence><sentence id="111">I remember one time I was walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> alone and a bunch of kids that I didn't know, and who did not know me, attacked me both verbally and physically.</sentence><sentence id="112">I tried to free myself but the circle closed around me and I felt punches coming all over.</sentence><sentence id="113">And I couldn't, it was both the physical pain and the emotional because that was my first encounter with an incident like this here, with anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="114">And I couldn't understand why.</sentence><sentence id="115">Why are they</sentence><sentence id="117">so angry with me?</sentence><sentence id="118">Why do they hate me so much?</sentence><sentence id="119">I was too young to understand it and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying bitterly.</sentence><sentence id="120">Usually I was not a cry baby and my mother saw that something serious must have happened, she was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">And she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), what's happened?"</sentence><sentence id="122">You'll see later why those things are important, because of the values.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: So your mother asked you what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: What happened.</sentence><sentence id="215">I related to her the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="216">And she did not say a single word, she just took me lovingly in her arms and she tried to comfort me.</sentence><sentence id="217">After I finally quieted down and stopped crying, she looked at me and she asked me, "Yit-cola (ph), and what did you do?"</sentence><sentence id="218">And I was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="219">I said, "Nothing."</sentence><sentence id="220">And my mother looked , She said, "Well my child, then you have nothing to cry about.</sentence><sentence id="221">Your does not depend on how others treat you but on how you treat others."</sentence><sentence id="222">And I remember my family taught me that my does not depend on how others treat me but how I treat others, which had a tremendous impact on me up to this date.</sentence><sentence id="223">Because they taught me how never to held others, how not to shame or held others because its not .</sentence><sentence id="224">But they never taught me, what should I do when I am held, how should I respond?</sentence><sentence id="225">So what I used to do, I use to cry.</sentence><sentence id="226">Because I knew I cannot held anybody and I cannot, and another thing which they taught me, is that no one can break my spirit as long as I don't do something evil.</sentence><sentence id="227">As long as I don't do something wrong.</sentence><sentence id="228">So they actually very much stressed , Yiddish 3 .</sentence><sentence id="229">Lreceived both, like I said at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Yiddish but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we spoke Polish and I had also, I went to Bant-tee-os-kov (ph), which was a Jewish and Hebrew school.</sentence><sentence id="230">My little brother actually started at age three.</sentence><sentence id="231">My parents were both culturally and religiously Jewish but they were not orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="232">But in those days, not orthodox was more than today, just like because we observed all the holidays, we had in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we lived accordingly to the Jewish teachings and customs and traditions.</sentence><sentence id="233">Because my mother was the only one of my grandmother's children who didn't wear a shaytal (ph), who didn't wear a wig, because my mother was a very artistic person.</sentence><sentence id="234">She had a beautiful voice and I remember still how she used to sing to me, teach me Yiddish songs.</sentence><sentence id="235">Because before my mother was married, she belonged to a Jewish drama group and she use to play in the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish Theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">And at that time, the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish Theater</span> used to be the , like a regular <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> but they had that in the <span class="BUILDING">fire house</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="237">Where the firemen lived, so they would allow them there.</sentence><sentence id="238">But after she was married and she had a family she would do it only for charity.</sentence><sentence id="239">So my parents very often used to take me to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and my mother belonged to a literary group.</sentence><sentence id="240">She was more, she was very artistic.</sentence><sentence id="241">If she would have had the opportunity then she would have done much more, but unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="242">And I think that she instilled in me a love for literature, she use to read aloud and tell stories, because as I said, my grandmother had lots of grandchildren and children.</sentence><sentence id="243">Except for one son and one cousin, you know the cousin that left in 1934, my cousin Yitle Pash-o-vick (ph), and one of my Uncles who left when he was 18 years old, I never knew him.</sentence><sentence id="244">I knew him only through photographs and through letters that the family used to get from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Because that's where he married and he lived.</sentence><sentence id="246">So the whole family lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we used to be a very close-knit family.</sentence><sentence id="247">So we got together and because there was not, as I had mentioned before, technology, so parts of, when we would get together they used to, the family used to sit and tell stories, reminisce, you know?</sentence><sentence id="248">And everybody thought that I don't even pay attention and I was just sitting in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and listen and take in all these stories.</sentence><sentence id="249">Another time also that I heard a lot of stories is that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, Chair-han-off (ph), where we lived, there was only one <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">But there was the , like they call it, like the <span class="BUILDING">study house</span> and a lot of the boys who came to study there, to the Yit-shiva (ph), some of them were from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> so they used to be on Friday or on holidays, my father would always bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in the Hebrew its</sentence><sentence id="252">called , or guests.</sentence><sentence id="253">And then there would be conversation at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they used to ask him questions and he would tell adventures and stories.</sentence><sentence id="254">So it was, and one thing also, that after my mother was married she didn't work so I always had my mother and my grandmother <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which was a great influence.</sentence><sentence id="255">I remember another story which also had a very great influence on me, is that we didn't have running water or electricity in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">And winter, to heat the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we cooked on an iron <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and to heat the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> it used to be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tile oven</span>, which reached from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, most people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had those, and they used to, they were able to open <span class="DLF">wells</span>, you put the wood to heat it, to bake potatoes and bake apple in there sometimes, but mostly the winter time this would be the source of heat, that heated the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">So when they came on the holidays and , they would sit around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and tell these stories.</sentence><sentence id="258">And so I heard a lot of stories and I knew a lot about Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I was always, when I started to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, one of my worst subjects was history.</sentence><sentence id="260">Because the way it was presented, it was just to me a bunch of dates, long ago, and a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">But it was not presented as relevant to our life and I had no idea before the Holocaust how history effects our lives, because history is made by people and it effects people.</sentence><sentence id="262">And I was a creative child.</sentence><sentence id="263">I loved to sing, I loved to write and to read, I was forever doing this.</sentence><sentence id="264">And I was dreaming that when I, after I finished <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, that I going to continue to have more formal education, that I'm going to become a writer.</sentence><sentence id="265">Even as a young girl I used to write a lot.</sentence><sentence id="266">And I remember my father always was so proud of me, my parents, my grandmother, and my father used to take me a lot with him so when we went someplace he always said, "Yit-cola (ph), recite a poem."</sentence><sentence id="267">And I was blessed until this day to God with a good memory and I've learned the poems and I learned lots of songs, both at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">And another source of, I remember that it's almost funny, that there used to people who would go in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and sing and play instruments and some had wonderful voices and played well, and people would throw them down money.</sentence><sentence id="269">So I remember once I was going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, it was on a Friday, I was going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">And those people played in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> and I always wanted to learn all the songs, so they sung a new song.</sentence><sentence id="271">I caught most of it but not all the words for the first time, so I figured they probably will not sing it again in the same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> so I followed them.</sentence><sentence id="272">And I got so involved that I completely forgot that its Friday and the family is going to be ready, the sha-bot (ph) was observed very strictly.</sentence><sentence id="273">And I remember I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the candles were lit already, and my father was sitting because the sha-bot (ph) was very strictly observed, and here I came in and my mother looked at me, and she said, "Yit- cola (ph), quickly.</sentence><sentence id="274">Go in and wash up.</sentence><sentence id="275">Come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sha-bot</span> (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="276">And I was so grateful that she didn't scream at me or anything.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I remember the holidays and sha-bot (ph), but like I mentioned before, I was born during Passover, so Passover was my birthday and we always faithfully, every year, we observed Passover.</sentence><sentence id="278">And it was so different than it is now because every single object of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was taken out in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">Dishes were changed.</sentence><sentence id="280">And at that time, I remember, we didn't have regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> like today, we had some burlap sacks and it was with straw, it was put in the, they changed the straw.</sentence><sentence id="281">And paint the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and wash every object.</sentence><sentence id="282">It was more for cleanliness, it was also because of the holiday, so Passover was both a physical and spiritual cleansing and I remember, the reason why I speak about Passover, is because it is very, it is coincidental, because I was born on Passover and I was liberated on Passover, during Passover, the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="283">And I was thinking that before, when we sat at the , and we're talking about slavery, talking about the Israelites, the slavery, about the plagues, about starvation, I couldn't understand this here.</sentence><sentence id="284">Because up until then, I was never starved.</sentence><sentence id="285">I never had any personal tragedy.</sentence><sentence id="286">My faith in God was not tested, it wasn't a , and I couldn't understand all those things.</sentence><sentence id="287">And I remember, now when I think back, I said, I'm not surprised that people do not understand what we suffered because only somebody who suffered can, maybe they can understand but not the same</sentence><sentence id="289">way.</sentence><sentence id="290">They cannot relate because, to give you an example, if someone, God forbid, has a terrible illness then when he talks with somebody who is healthy at that time, the healthy person could talk about the future and relates different to life, sees life differently, and this is here.</sentence><sentence id="291">So, in my, it never entered my mind that one day I will suffer like this here.</sentence><sentence id="292">That my people will suffer like this here.</sentence><sentence id="293">And I remember also another incident, its like I started to tell you, we didn't have heat but, we didn't have running water and we didn't have electricity in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="640">She was a very happy person and from what everybody told me a tremendous leader.</sentence><sentence id="641">Very, very much for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="642">She was very much involved in Zionist and she was hoping that, very much involved.</sentence><sentence id="643">You know, the older children, because I was and I think because of my grandmother I didn't, I was more in the religious influence, but I also was lucky because I had all other influence from my parents who took me to the <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, who took me to Jewish plays and every summer we would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and , cousins, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, because I had cousins there, I had cousins, the , SO we would get together.</sentence><sentence id="644">And I remember like today, I used to be so happy to go with my mother and she was very affectionate, she was very warm.</sentence><sentence id="645">And I remember, I'm not a thinker, but my mother, which also made a great influence, that she instilled in me a love for literature and for singing and everything.</sentence><sentence id="646">Is that when we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> like we have now.</sentence><sentence id="647">We had what they called a French amour" (ph) and it was a wooden chest that reached almost from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and it had two <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="648">Facing the chest, the right-hand side was wider, it was used for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>, and the left side was for linen and the very highest it had hats of my grandmother's and my mother's, hats lying there.</sentence><sentence id="649">And for some reason, when I was younger, this was still a pre-schooler, this was always locked, this side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">And I couldn't understand why, I was so curious and I</sentence><sentence id="652">used to try to play all kinds of games to try to guess what is in that chest.</sentence><sentence id="653">And I used to think, maybe a treasure, maybe a skeleton, I even used to went so far as to think that maybe I am adopted and they don't want me to know that I am adopted and they are hiding the papers.</sentence><sentence id="654">It was a whole source of curiosity for me.</sentence><sentence id="655">And I remember one day my mother said, "Yit-cola (ph), please come.</sentence><sentence id="656">Come here.</sentence><sentence id="657">I want to show you something."</sentence><sentence id="658">She took out the key and she opened the chest.</sentence><sentence id="659">And I had like two kinds of emotions.</sentence><sentence id="660">In one way, I was burning with curiosity to see what is in the chest that was constantly closed.</sentence><sentence id="661">And on the other hand, I was frightened, what I'm going to find there?What is there?</sentence><sentence id="662">And she opened the chest and she said, "Look Yit-cola (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="663">And it was a whole chest full of books, all leather-bound books.</sentence><sentence id="664">And she took out a book, pointed to the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, she said, "Yit-cola (ph), when you will learn how to read, you will be with the greatest minds.</sentence><sentence id="665">You can sit right here in Chair-hon-off (ph), you will see the world through great poets and writers and you will travel all over the world."</sentence><sentence id="666">And she took out a book, she took me on her knee, and she started to read.</sentence><sentence id="667">And this became a daily ritual to which I looked forward.</sentence><sentence id="668">And I was quite young when I knew a lot of Yiddish literature and Yiddish plays and poetry because my mother never read to me little children's stories, she started with this grown up stuff.</sentence><sentence id="669">And one story that I wanted to relate, which was written by , a Yiddish writer, it was called , Bunchos (ph) of the Silent.</sentence><sentence id="670">I remember many stories, but this story I'm relating to you because I've been thinking about it most of the time when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="671">And the story is about a young child, about a man actually who was called Bunchos (ph), which means silent.</sentence><sentence id="672">And this man, when he was a little child, lost his mother and became an orphan, only had his father.</sentence><sentence id="673">At the age of 13, the father remarried and took a very cruel woman who abused the little boy.</sentence><sentence id="674">She would eat well but she would starve him.</sentence><sentence id="675">She made him chop wood barefoot in the winter.</sentence><sentence id="676">He never had a new change of clothes.</sentence><sentence id="677">They didn't send him to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">Didn't have a friend.</sentence><sentence id="679">But no matter what she, he was constantly lonely, but he never complained, not even to his father.</sentence><sentence id="680">And one time, in the middle of the winter, in a drunken stupor, his father threw him out in the middle of the night, dragged him out by the hair.</sentence><sentence id="681">He picked himself up and he left and he was going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="682">He wandered into a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and for no reason known to him he was put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">And then he was, for the same unknown reason to him, he was let go.</sentence><sentence id="684">But he was still silent.</sentence><sentence id="685">Never complained.</sentence><sentence id="686">Then the story relates how he suffered also, starvation, looking for job, and worse than the job was looking for the job, and then people wouldn't pay him.</sentence><sentence id="687">He was constantly abused but Buncho (ph) was always silent.</sentence><sentence id="688">And then he married a woman who already had a child.</sentence><sentence id="689">And it was a little boy, a baby.</sentence><sentence id="690">And she left him with the child and he raised the child, when the boy was 15 years old, he threw him out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="691">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buncho</span> (ph) was again silent.</sentence><sentence id="692">And it relates the whole story, a beautiful story.</sentence><sentence id="693">It kept me so in suspense.</sentence><sentence id="694">I remember it today.</sentence><sentence id="695">Actually when I learned to read Yiddish, which I learned to read well, I read many of the books which my mother had in that chest.</sentence><sentence id="696">And the reason why she kept it locked is because I was the oldest child and she was afraid that the little children might damage her books.</sentence><sentence id="697">Later, when we were older, the chest was open when we learned to respect it.</sentence><sentence id="698">But its just the values that she had.</sentence><sentence id="699">So this man was constantly abused and later somebody run him over with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">And even in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where people are allowed to complain, he was still silent.</sentence><sentence id="701">And in silence he lived and in silence he died.</sentence><sentence id="702">And after he was buried they put a piece of wood and a marker on his <span class="DLF">grave</span> and the wind blew away the marker and the gravedigger's wife found it and used it to light the, to heat the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="703">So he didn't even have a <span class="DLF">grave</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="704">And then, but it was different, the writer says, in the other world, the world where there is justice.</sentence><sentence id="705">And when he came up, they told him, "Buncho (ph), here in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> everything is yours.</sentence><sentence id="706">Whatever you want.</sentence><sentence id="707">Pick, choose."</sentence><sentence id="708">And he couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="709">Why would somebody be so good to him in the</sentence><sentence id="711">0 other <span class="NPIP">world</span> where they were so cruel to him here?</sentence><sentence id="712">And yet, Buncho (ph) didn't complain.</sentence><sentence id="713">Not to man, not to God, never, he was envious that somebody had more.</sentence><sentence id="714">So finally they said, "Buncho (ph), what would you like?"</sentence><sentence id="715">And he couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="716">And finally he said, "Well, your Excellency, all I would like is every morning for breakfast a hot roll with butter."</sentence><sentence id="717">And when I was, later during the Nazis, I was thinking very much about this story because I realized why he was silent.</sentence><sentence id="718">He had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="719">And also, what would we give for a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="720">So the literature, and also another thing which I often think about this story, is that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> (ph) who was a great Yiddish writer, that he wrote about one man and this has become a Yiddish classic.</sentence><sentence id="721">This book is in English still and its beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="722">I didn't go into all the details because it would be too long, but the basic thing is, the cruelty.</sentence><sentence id="723">And when he says here that they look, why was he silent?</sentence><sentence id="724">He didn't have to be silent, he should have cried out.</sentence><sentence id="725">But when the Nazis came in, I realized that I became like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</sentence><sentence id="726">When <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the first thing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, the first thing I remember, because at that time we lived in the other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="727">And our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was strict , which was near <span class="DLF">Warsaw Street</span>, which was the main <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">And as soon as we came out, this was almost in the corner, was a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, they had like big <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="729">So when the air raids was, we went to hiding, into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="730">And even there, sitting there, my mother tried to calm us down with telling us stories.</sentence><sentence id="731">She was such a wonderful story-teller and she knew so much literature and so many plays.</sentence><sentence id="732">And then, when they just came in, we were still allowed to move from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so people started to run.</sentence><sentence id="733">People from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> came to small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">Other people came to different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">And my father's entire family, his sisters, three sisters, one natural sister and two half-sisters, because his father died when he was a young boy, and my father was born in Pull-tos (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="736">So they still lived with the children and, I think, their nieces and nephews, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pull-tos</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="737">And we didn't know what's happened to them because, so my father was going to go, I remember today the conversation between my parents, he said, "Let's go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pull-tos</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="738">My sisters are gone."</sentence><sentence id="739">Because both parents, like, I never knew my grandparents on my father's side, so he held the responsibilities being the oldest child, to take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="740">But we didn't know, we didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="741">And then, when they took <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, we could no longer go from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: So, anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="895">When the Nazis came in to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, that was the last time that I saw my relatives.</sentence><sentence id="896">All the other relatives that lived in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> because we could no longer travel from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">They started by taking up the spiritual and the community leaders, the</sentence><sentence id="899">1 intelligencia (ph).</sentence><sentence id="900">Some Polish people too.</sentence><sentence id="901">And they took them away some, they shot, the ones they took away, I didn't see what they did with them so I can only bear witness for what I saw.</sentence><sentence id="902">And they started to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogues</span>, the Holy Scriptures.</sentence><sentence id="903">They confiscated all our <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="904">We didn't have, in Check-hon-off (ph) a business.</sentence><sentence id="905">My father was, like I said, I told you before.</sentence><sentence id="906">And they started to put on curfews.</sentence><sentence id="907">We were not allowed to congregate in large groups.</sentence><sentence id="908">I could no longer, we could no longer go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, all <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="909">All <span class="BUILDING">social Temples</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="910">We had to wear a yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="911">We were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span>, just in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">And we had to give up, everyday when we're told this is the worst, something worst happened.</sentence><sentence id="913">Everyday they made new laws.</sentence><sentence id="914">And we were not allowed any longer to observe the Jewish laws because they burned, not openly, they had to do it in hiding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="938">Q: How soon did this happen after they came in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="940">A: Well the burnings, they started to burn books.</sentence><sentence id="941">I told you, my mother valued so much book and its still such a love for me, for books, and here they started to burn the Holy, all the books that was from the Yi-shiv-as (ph) and all the books from the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>, they burned down everything.</sentence><sentence id="942">So they started to just destruction right away, and curfews, and we were not allowed to congregate in large groups, you know, for religious people, to go for ; which is you have to have 10 people to have for the prayers.</sentence><sentence id="943">So all those things were, actually religious people suffered the most.</sentence><sentence id="944">They started to, when they saw elderly men, most of the people, my father didn't have a beard, he was clean-shaven, but so many other people did.</sentence><sentence id="945">So they laughed, they started to pull out the beard or they would shave off half a beard.</sentence><sentence id="946">They started to torture, to mock.</sentence><sentence id="947">Because to, they did whatever they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="948">They had all legal rights to do those things.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="949">And then they confiscated the <span class="BUILDING">business</span>, they looted the merchandise.</sentence><sentence id="950">They started to ration the food and started starvation.</sentence><sentence id="951">And also we had to, they would grab people to do the work in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="952">And after a whole day's work, they would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and would have to stay in long <span class="DLF">lines</span> to get a small ration, a very small ration.</sentence><sentence id="953">So right away we started to starve.</sentence><sentence id="954">Couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="955">And in other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> the most important right is the right to protest, to speak up.</sentence><sentence id="956">But you couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="957">So that's when I was thinking a lot about starvation, about Buncho (ph) the Silent.</sentence><sentence id="958">That we had to be silent, you know, in order to survive.</sentence><sentence id="959">And then something happened which effected me very much personally, and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="960">They asked us to give up all our valuables, gold and valuables, so we become impoverished and we had to do forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="961">So one day, and also there was a law, that the Jewish people, for the Germans to associate with Jewish people was</sentence></p><p><sentence id="962">because they singled us out as an inferior race.</sentence><sentence id="963">And we were not allowed to have any transactions, not business, not social, not sexual, because for the Nazi and the Jew, if this would happen, it would be punished.</sentence><sentence id="964">And we had a big and one time a man, a civilian, until this day I don't know his name, but I remember the incident very clearly because I was also involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="965">A man came in and he was selling household articles.</sentence><sentence id="966">Since people, most people gave up the money because they didn't want to risk, if they are caught for whatever you did against the law, it was punishable by death.</sentence><sentence id="967">And even without any reason they shot and they killed and they tortured.</sentence><sentence id="968">But anyhow, so when he came in a lot of people, just for curiosity, came and looked.</sentence><sentence id="969">And one man walked by, his name was Cal-fus (ph).</sentence><sentence id="970">He was the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">And he walked by too and he came in.</sentence><sentence id="972">And my mother all of a sudden realized that if somebody is going to see us standing and having any business transaction with somebody who is not Jewish, and we didn't know whether he was Polish or whether he was German, because there was a lot of , that is somebody who is of German descent but he didn't live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="973">So she said, she was afraid, so she said, "Please come into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="974">She invited everybody.</sentence><sentence id="975">And Cal-fus (ph) obviously took a risk and he didn't give away all the money.</sentence><sentence id="976">So he</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="980">2 bought maybe 90 percent of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">merchandise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">My mother didn't buy anything.</sentence><sentence id="982">We gave up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">merchandise</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="983">Maybe he hid a little bit because I remember, but before we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I remember seeing my mother taking out from her corset, you know women were wearing corsets, and it was like a bone, like a plastic bone, she pulled this out and she made rolls of money and she stuffed it in so they could hide it on them, so they must have saved some money but maybe she didn't want to spend it or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="984">But anyhow, the Nazis left, I mean the, Cal-fus (ph) left, the people left and this man, who was selling the merchandise.</sentence><sentence id="985">But it didn't take long, this same man brought the Gestapo into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and denounced my mother.</sentence><sentence id="986">And they asked my mother, "Who is the man who brought the merchandise, because he told us."</sentence><sentence id="987">And that is the first time in my life that I heard my mother lie.</sentence><sentence id="988">She said she didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="989">But she did know who he was.</sentence><sentence id="990">He was not a personal friend so we were not very involved with him, but we knew who Cal-fus (ph) is, I knew him very well because, like I said, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="991">So after...</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="995">3 Tape 2</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: So, I was telling you of the story about, when this man who sold the household articles that we didn't know brought the Gestapo to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they interrogated my mother.</sentence><sentence id="997">They wanted her to tell who Cal-fus (ph) was.</sentence><sentence id="998">And, I'm not sure whether I mentioned this, that this was the first time I heard my mother lying.</sentence><sentence id="999">That she said she didn't know, she denied it.</sentence><sentence id="1000">So after interrogated for quite a while, they saw that they cannot get out of her anything.</sentence><sentence id="1001">They took her away.</sentence><sentence id="1002">The Gestapo took her away.</sentence><sentence id="1003">I was by that time 13 years old, and I saw already the cruelty, what's going on, they started many destructions, many people were already killed and tortured.</sentence><sentence id="1004">So I was afraid to be separated from my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1005">So I run after her.</sentence><sentence id="1006">And I was determined, no matter what's going to happen, I'm not going to leave her alone.</sentence><sentence id="1007">So they kept on chasing me away.</sentence><sentence id="1008">And finally, one of them said, "Take her too."</sentence><sentence id="1009">And I was almost happy that they took me too because I think that whatever happened, otherwise I won't even know if they take her away, I want to know what's happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And they brought us to the Gestapo, the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and they separated us.</sentence><sentence id="1011">They took my mother in to a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1012">This, I was not an eye-witness, I was an ear-witness.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And, what I heard, it sounded like they were beating her and she was screaming.</sentence><sentence id="1014">The shouts got louder and louder and after a while it was silent.</sentence><sentence id="1015">That's when my heart almost stopped too, because as long as she was screaming, I knew that she's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1016">But when it was silent, I had no longer any knowledge, whether she's still alive, whether she's conscious.</sentence><sentence id="1017">And what seemed to me like an eternity, I cannot estimate how long it took, but finally the <span class="DLF">doors</span> swung open.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Two Gestapos, each holding her under the armpit, dragging her across the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1019">And took me in, to be next.</sentence><sentence id="1020">And I wanted to see whether my mother, I saw she was bleeding, and I wanted to see whether she is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1021">So I looked at her, while they took me out, took her out, they took me into the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And she didn't say anything, but she gave me a sign not to say anything.</sentence><sentence id="1023">And I loved my mother because she always loved me so much and I knew what kind of a person she was.</sentence><sentence id="1024">So I was, when they started to ask me questions I said, "I don't know it."</sentence><sentence id="1025">I lied too.</sentence><sentence id="1026">Deliberately.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And they started to beat me and I was screaming, and my mother heard me scream but she didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And after I was beaten quite well, they, because we spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and Yiddish is similar to German, they understood, that they said, "Gin-nook (ph)".</sentence><sentence id="1029">Enough. ,</sentence><sentence id="1030">which means maybe we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1031">Maybe we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1032">And that's when they released us.</sentence><sentence id="1033">This story begun in 1939, shortly after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1034">I didn't see anymore Cal-fus (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1035">I didn't know what's happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="1036">At that time, the Nazis used all kinds of techniques.</sentence><sentence id="1037">They reversed, you see, Hitler's laws were a reversal of all the Jewish laws.</sentence><sentence id="1038">We, in Judaism, in <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, they taught us that we are all responsible for one another.</sentence><sentence id="1039">What they did is that if one person did something wrong, they punished us all.</sentence><sentence id="1040">Group punishment for individual action.</sentence><sentence id="1041">So, and ironically, what was legally ours they took away by force and we were punished for trying to keep it or to have it.</sentence><sentence id="1042">So I didn't know what's happened to the Cal-fus (ph) family but what we knew, both my mother and I, is that if we would have told they would have killed the whole family, not just the father.</sentence><sentence id="1043">And I'm going to stop here because I don't want to lose the end of this story because this story had a tremendous impact on me.</sentence><sentence id="1044">And I'm going to skip and come back later to 1939.</sentence><sentence id="1045">I'm going now to 1981 when I went to the world gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors, okay?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1096">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1098">A: And when we came, only Jewish survivors, there was some people before I left that they wanted me to be in a documentary, to be a witness in a documentary.</sentence><sentence id="1099">And I told them that story.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Anyhow, when we came there, each of us, I'm not going to go into the whole, direct to the story, each of us got a badge and it says, on mine it says, Itka Zygmuntowicz USA.</sentence><sentence id="1101">That was all.</sentence><sentence id="1102">And as I was</sentence><sentence id="1104">4 standing, this was the last date when we were marched into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1105">And Menachem Bacon was the President there.</sentence><sentence id="1106">And I was overwhelmed with emotion to think from the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, to come now to the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> and after so many, more than 2,000 years, to have our homeland, and then I understood already what it means to have our homeland, then people cannot tell you, "The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are yours but the <span class="DLF">streets</span> are ours."</sentence><sentence id="1107">And I was overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="1108">And I was so eager to go to march, and that march as a free person, as a proud Jew, but they asked me not to because they needed me to bear testimony in case I see something or to ask questions.</sentence><sentence id="1109">And as the people are marching and I'm standing there, all of a sudden I said to myself, "Can I have a marker or a pen?"</sentence><sentence id="1110">And I wrote on my badge, Fri-mand (ph), Check-hon-off (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1111">I figured in case somebody recognized, you know, walks by, they do not recognize me.</sentence><sentence id="1112">I was 13 when the war broke out and now I am an adult.</sentence><sentence id="1113">My name has changed.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Who will know me?</sentence><sentence id="1115">And as I stand there, Kentel

id="1116">And he looked at my badge, he said, "You're from Chair-hon-off (ph)?"</sentence><sentence id="1117">And I said, "Yes, Chair-hon-off (ph).".</sentence><sentence id="1118">And with him walked another man and he said, "I'm from Chair-hon-off (ph) too."</sentence><sentence id="1119">And I said, "Who are you?"</sentence><sentence id="1120">And he said, "Cal-hus (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="1121">And I went berserk.</sentence><sentence id="1122">I started to cry and to laugh and I was so excited and he had the matches, holding the cup, and the people who were interviewing him said, "Ask him for the address."</sentence><sentence id="1123">So I asked him for the address and before he gave I said, "Are you the son or the father?"</sentence><sentence id="1124">Because he looked too young to be the father.</sentence><sentence id="1125">He said, "I'm Cal-hus's (ph) son."</sentence><sentence id="1126">And he gave us a card, he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Natan-alia</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because after the war he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and he married an Israeli-Jewish .</sentence><sentence id="1127">And we went there to interview him too.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And I found out his father, unfortunately, died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1129">But he and another brother survived.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And both are married and have children

to be rich or famous and you can give away , good deed and your , and three generations.</sentence><sentence id="1133">When I was in 1981, alive because of our sacrifice.</sentence><sentence

humanness.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And now you understand why I was sharing with you the lessons, what my mother said.</sentence><sentence id="1138">doesn't depend, and then I'm going back to 1939, but I felt, I wanted to finish and complete the story so that you will know.</sentence><sentence id="1139">Actually, Cal-fus (ph) invited us, our family, and there was a tremendous reunion.</sentence><sentence id="1140">They took him and made him a part of the, you know, the interview.</sentence><sentence id="1141">Anyhow, we are back in Chair-hon-off (ph) in 1939.</sentence><sentence id="1142">After they took away from us all our freedom, they took away from us all our possessions.</sentence><sentence id="1143">In the meantime, my grandmother died.</sentence><sentence id="1144">That was before we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1145">My grandmother was no longer alive.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And I was heartbroken because, except for my parents, I have never had as a close relationship with anyone as I had with my parents and with my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="1147">And she had such a great influence in this, I was heartbroken.</sentence><sentence id="1148">But looking back, I am grateful that she did not have to go to what we went through and she died in her own

the left.</sentence><sentence id="1776">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="1777">And all of a sudden, when we came there facing the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where it said All-might-muck-fry (ph), this is the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1778">On the right- hand side, which would be the left, but on my side facing, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross

families.</sentence><sentence id="1783">Separate the families.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Pulled out children from the hands of their parents.</sentence><sentence id="1785">Little infants away from the mother.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And they started to make the selection.</sentence><sentence id="1787">To the left and to the right.</sentence><sentence id="1788">Immediately they took away my father.</sentence><sentence id="1789">My father was a young man, maybe early 40's or 40 or so.</sentence><sentence id="1790">And they took away my little brother and sister.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: I don't know their exact age, they were younger than I but I just go by because I know that my little sister, when the Nazis came in she hadn't start yet <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And my brother wasn't yet barmitzvah, so I don't know their exact age.</sentence><sentence id="1853">It was, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we didn't celebrate birthdays like here because for the Jewish people didn't, some people didn't want to say their age because they believe in the evil eye and things like this.</sentence><sentence id="1854">I don't know, superstitious.</sentence><sentence id="1855">But anyhow, they were still young.</sentence><sentence id="1856">So when they took them away, my mother was with me, and everything went so fast that I didn't even have time to think.</sentence><sentence id="1857">And then my mother turned to me and she said, "Yit-cola (ph), you're a big girl.</sentence><sentence id="1858">I have to go with the little children.</sentence><sentence id="1859">But remember my child, no matter what's going to happen to you, don't become hateful and bitter.</sentence><sentence id="1860">Don't let them destroy you."</sentence><sentence id="1861">That was her last words.</sentence><sentence id="1862">And all of a sudden I was all alone.</sentence><sentence id="1863">And that's it, everything that I had, everything, because I was became dead.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And I didn't even have a chance to say good-bye because I didn't know that we are parting forever.</sentence><sentence id="1865">I didn't know about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1866">My personal experience, nothing can historically, I never knew about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1867">When you saw that we were deceived.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Deceived, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1869">So then they lined us up and we were taken into the, a different way.</sentence><sentence id="1870">And they left for the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And they took them away.</sentence><sentence id="1872">I didn't know at that time where, I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="1873">Now when I know what's happened, but I mean, at the time when they took us away we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And they took away all older people, young children, pregnant woman.</sentence><sentence id="1875">So I talk to myself, I remember it today, look how kind they are because we were told that we were all going to be together.</sentence><sentence id="1876">So we thought that they give them a ride, which I appreciated very much.</sentence><sentence id="1877">I figured the little children, but I had no idea that we are parted forever.</sentence><sentence id="1878">Who could know that doctors who were trained to say the Hippocratic oath, that are trained to heal the sick are going to kill their health.</sentence><sentence id="1879">In fact, I wrote a poem about Mengelia.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Would you like me to say it?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1951">A: Oh, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1952">They immediately had the selections.</sentence><sentence id="1953">Mangelia sent them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And I remember they were holding hands, you know, my little brother and sister.</sentence><sentence id="1955">My brother was protecting my little sister, they took them away.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And then my mother saw them going away.</sentence><sentence id="1957">I don't know how much she know, what she knew, but again her , she made a fatal choice and she went with the children.</sentence><sentence id="1958">She said she cannot leave them alone, you are a big girl.</sentence><sentence id="1959">So that was the last time I ever saw them.</sentence><sentence id="1960">The whole family for four generations.</sentence><sentence id="1961">And I had no idea where my Aunt, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, she was married with children, my Aunt in the .</sentence><sentence id="1962">Another , all the relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1963">I never said good-bye, I don't know what's happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="1964">Whether my Aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, whether she was, this we will never know.</sentence><sentence id="1967">1 We don't even have, you understand why this story of Buncho (ph) the Silent, I was thinking.</sentence><sentence id="1968">Because, I don't know whether it was just coincidental that this story had such an effect on me and why I remembered because Buncho (ph) the Silent in the story was 13 years old, when the step- mother came.</sentence><sentence id="1969">And also I was many times thinking that we live for so long, since about the 1600 century my ancestors came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1970">And yet, we had to leave everything.</sentence><sentence id="1971">Everything that was ours they inherited, they took away everything.</sentence><sentence id="1972">Nothing was ours.</sentence><sentence id="1973">And, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1974">And then when we came there, they shaved our heads, everybody had shaved heads.</sentence><sentence id="1975">The guys, it was done too.</sentence><sentence id="1976">And then we were the fortunate ones, at that time we didn't know because good and bad fortune can only be understood in retrospect.</sentence><sentence id="1977">So I didn't realize that I was still lucky, that I got the number.</sentence><sentence id="1978">At least I'm alive with the number.</sentence><sentence id="1979">And then we really got a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, we didn't get gassed, but obviously, or I wouldn't be here to tell you this.</sentence><sentence id="1980">But we got a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, which we welcomed because a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> was, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1981">And then we went out for, a whole full of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was laying uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1982">And they were striped, the same thing as we saw with the ones who came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1983">And, not from the Nazis, this was also hefflinger (ph), which means Jewish people who were interred there.</sentence><sentence id="1984">And then they gave us those uniforms and they took away our shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1985">Everything was taken.</sentence><sentence id="1986">Our clothes, our shoes, our hair, our name.</sentence><sentence id="1987">Everything.</sentence><sentence id="1988">And all of a sudden, I realized that to them I was just a number.</sentence><sentence id="1989">And I remember that at the time, when they called, you know they never called us by name but number, in order to dehumanize us, that we should give in and give up.</sentence><sentence id="1990">They always would call my number, which was 2-5-6-7-3 [in German], and whenever they say that I always would say under my breath, "Yit-cola (ph)".</sentence><sentence id="1991">Because I thought to myself, how can I be a number?</sentence><sentence id="1992">I can feel, I can think, I can laugh.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Of course I didn't have freedom but I had freedom of mind, freedom of thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="1994">And so I, this was my spiritual form of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1995">That I refused to see myself through their minds.</sentence><sentence id="1996">And after they gave us the, instead of my shoes, which was a nice pair of shoes too, they gave us wooden clogs.</sentence><sentence id="1997">And mine, unfortunately, were not matching.</sentence><sentence id="1998">And we got an enamel bowl.</sentence><sentence id="1999">And this was all our worldly possessions.</sentence><sentence id="2000">In one <span class="NPIP">day</span> our entire past was wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="2001">And we had no future.</sentence><sentence id="2002">We didn't know it then yet.</sentence><sentence id="2003">I didn't know about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="2004">And they marched us into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2060">Q: Let me ask you one question here.</sentence><sentence id="2061">Was there anyone in this group you knew from before?</sentence><sentence id="2062">Did you know some people from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2066">A: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="2067">We came with people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2070">Q: Did any of the older people try to protect you because your mother wasn't with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2072">A: The older people didn't come in with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2074">Q: Well, older meaning three years older, or?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2076">A: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I mean, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> there was pretty much solidarity.</sentence><sentence id="2077">However, I had one bad experience.</sentence><sentence id="2078">And I'll come to it.</sentence><sentence id="2079">So when they gave us, and we always had to march to <span class="DLF">line</span> up, never, since I came in on November 22, 1942, until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was resolved, until January 18, 1945, I had no longer freedom.</sentence><sentence id="2080">No freedom.</sentence><sentence id="2081">We were, everything, because from the morning we woke up, we came in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, it was a real big, long <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2082">And was three layer <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And crowded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> with one blanket.</sentence><sentence id="2084">And they were so low that you couldn't sit up.</sentence><sentence id="2085">We couldn't sit up.</sentence><sentence id="2086">The same clothes, the shift that we got, with this I slept.</sentence><sentence id="2087">There was no night clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2088">From 1942 to 1945 I never brushed my teeth.</sentence><sentence id="2089">I never saw myself in a mirror.</sentence><sentence id="2090">Nobody ever embraced me.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Nobody ever said, after having so much love.</sentence><sentence id="2092">So when I'm looking back from an environment where I was free like a bird, to come to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I felt like in a cage.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And you know, you can put a bird in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span> but you cannot deprive them of their desire to fly.</sentence><sentence id="2094">They took away my freedom but they couldn't take away my desire to be free.</sentence><sentence id="2095">They took away my loved ones but they could not take away my desire to live.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And I guess there were many horrible things</sentence><sentence id="2098">2 but probably the most horrible was losing everyone I loved.</sentence><sentence id="2099">And not only experiencing my own suffering, but witnessing the suffering of others and have to be silent like Buncho (ph) the Silent.</sentence><sentence id="2100">And I couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2101">And in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, where I could say something when the Nazis were not there at night, it was like the Tower of Babel.</sentence><sentence id="2102">Because everyone spoke a different language.</sentence><sentence id="2103">And we were too tired, too grieved in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2104">So when we came in, so many people were crowded in this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2105">And all of a sudden, from a happy sheltered loving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to be thrown into an environment like this.</sentence><sentence id="2106">And everybody was suffering.</sentence><sentence id="2107">My first concern was, when is our family going to come?</sentence><sentence id="2108">But I still was naive enough to believe what the Nazis told us, that we are going to get united.</sentence><sentence id="2109">So I'm waiting.</sentence><sentence id="2110">And I don't see them.</sentence><sentence id="2111">So I start asking questions.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And there is a conspiracy almost like, so silent.</sentence><sentence id="2113">Whether they didn't want to tell us because they didn't want to break my heart, or whether they were not allowed to?</sentence><sentence id="2114">This I don't know, but whoever I asked nobody answered anything.</sentence><sentence id="2115">They didn't say yes or no, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2116">Finally, after constantly badgering and repeating, one of the girls said, "You might as well tell her.</sentence><sentence id="2117">We are all here condemned to die."</sentence><sentence id="2118">And she points at the smoke and she said, "You see that <span class="DLF">chimney</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2119">This is where your parents are."</sentence><sentence id="2120">And tells me the story about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2121">She said, "This is where we're all going to be."</sentence><sentence id="2122">Remember I related a story, it was when I was a child, I went to the funeral, my parents took me to the funeral and they told me that, to take your own life is a sin.</sentence><sentence id="2123">It's like spitting God and your parents in their face because they gave you a gift and its against the Jewish law.</sentence><sentence id="2124">So I did not for once think about committing suicide.</sentence><sentence id="2125">But at that moment, if I would have been able to die when I found this out, that's how horrible my grief was.</sentence><sentence id="2126">And I just was ready to give up.</sentence><sentence id="2127">I was not trying to think about committing suicide, but I became oblivious.</sentence><sentence id="2128">I didn't care what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="2129">And anyhow...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: Can I ask you a question here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2186">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2188">Q: How long do you think you were there before you realized this?</sentence><sentence id="2189">Or before you were told this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2192">A: I didn't know the first day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2194">Q: Was it a few months?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2196">A: No, no, not months.</sentence><sentence id="2197">It was in a few days.</sentence><sentence id="2198">The exact day I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2199">Not very long, not very long.</sentence><sentence id="2200">Because I was constantly asking and badgering the girls.</sentence><sentence id="2201">And I'm going to go in later to describe what a day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was, but for now, they gave us the ration bread and I felt like, its like a funeral for me.</sentence><sentence id="2202">I lost everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2203">So I didn't, couldn't, I was starved but I couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="2204">So I took the bread and left it.</sentence><sentence id="2205">In the morning my bread was gone.</sentence><sentence id="2206">And one of the girls there, I don't remember her last name any longer, Esther I know was her first name, she was from Chair-ta-hoff (ph) and she actually came from a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2207">I don't know whether the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was during the war because from what I know she was not a criminal, so maybe she, the Nazi laws were different than our laws.</sentence><sentence id="2208">For keeping on, for wanting to practice our religion, for wanting to live.</sentence><sentence id="2209">To kill you was legal.</sentence><sentence id="2210">But to save a Jewish child or a Jewish adult was illegal and punishable by death.</sentence><sentence id="2211">To survive was to them, everything that was our they have taken away, if we would try to keep something, we were treated like criminals.</sentence><sentence id="2212">So anyhow, in the morning Esther says to me, "Oh poo Yit-ka (ph), somebody stole your bread."</sentence><sentence id="2213">And I said, "My gosh, what <span class="NPIP">place</span> is this?</sentence><sentence id="2214">Stealing somebody's piece of bread."</sentence><sentence id="2215">And when I got the next day my bread, I couldn't eat again.</sentence><sentence id="2216">Even though I was, like my throat was locked.</sentence><sentence id="2217">And I left the bread.</sentence><sentence id="2218">In the night for some reason we slept so many people on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, so if one had to turn, so we slept on our sides like sardines, the other, we had to wake the others, so somebody woke up.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And as I wake up, the girl, Esther, who pitied me was eating my bread.</sentence><sentence id="2220">And that was almost like the last straw for me.</sentence><sentence id="2221">And at that point I just didn't care what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="2222">And I was sitting and crying.</sentence><sentence id="2223">And I didn't know it at the time, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span></sentence><sentence id="2225">3 if you didn't get up for the or the counting, if you didn't obey the law for anything, you would right away be killed, taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2226">So a girl walks over and she ask me, "Why are you crying?"</sentence><sentence id="2227">And I didn't care at all, I was so, so heartbroken, that I just started crying.</sentence><sentence id="2228">I just didn't even want to answer.</sentence><sentence id="2229">Finally she, it was something in her voice, that I felt that like she's caring, which I started to understand and I remembered what my grandmother use to say, "Yes my child, but kindness and caring cannot be little things."</sentence><sentence id="2230">Like when I did the .</sentence><sentence id="2231">And what's happened?</sentence><sentence id="2232">And finally I tell her.</sentence><sentence id="2233">And she said, she thought that I cried because of the bread, I cried of the whole situation, of losing the family and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2234">So she took a piece of her bread and she broke it off and she said, "Take it."</sentence><sentence id="2235">And I didn't want to take it.</sentence><sentence id="2236">Because I already knew that we are all there to be killed, that it's just a matter of time.</sentence><sentence id="2237">So I figured I cannot afford to get involved with anybody, to care for someone, to have a relationship, because in case one of us goes, there's going to be additional pain, to protect myself from the pain.</sentence><sentence id="2238">But there was something in her voice and her face and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2239">Her name is Benack (ph), at the time, was Binna Gold-cut (ph), Yanka Gold-cut (ph), because she use to call herself Yanka.</sentence><sentence id="2240">And finally I took the bread and I said, "No, I cannot alone, no matter how long I'm going to live, alone.</sentence><sentence id="2241">It's not even worth living.</sentence><sentence id="2242">I'm all alone."</sentence><sentence id="2243">I took the bread and Binna became my dearest friend.</sentence><sentence id="2244">And from that day on, she became like my sister.</sentence><sentence id="2245">We cared for each other.</sentence><sentence id="2246">We cared deeply for each other and we helped each other.</sentence><sentence id="2247">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, a piece of bread meant life.</sentence><sentence id="2248">Meant winning in the game of survival.</sentence><sentence id="2249">So I just felt that she was so kind, that she was able to break up, and the contrast.</sentence><sentence id="2250">Here, Esther stole my piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2251">And this girl gave away a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2252">I didn't even know until this day, I don't know when she came, I didn't know at that time anything.</sentence><sentence id="2253">Now I know that she was born in

the bread and with it something in my spirit started to soar again and we made a commitment, Binna and I. We didn't know if we were going to get out of there, but to live or to die with , with humanness.</sentence><sentence id="2256">Not to lose our dignity.</sentence><sentence id="2257">And this is important to know, that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there were two kinds of laws.</sentence><sentence id="2258">If somebody was hungry and while they were carrying the cauldron with soup, people would lift up the lid and put in their bowl and grab and run.</sentence><sentence id="2259">If they were lucky they could run away.</sentence><sentence id="2260">If they caught them, they would get 25 on their bare behind.</sentence><sentence id="2261">And sometimes even worse.</sentence><sentence id="2262">But one inmate from the other, that was a no law.</sentence><sentence id="2263">Would not take, because we know this meant survival.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And from 1942 to 1945 I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, nobody ever stole from me anything.</sentence><sentence id="2265">You know?</sentence><sentence id="2266">And we felt like we had no freedom at all.</sentence><sentence id="2267">No freedom of movement, only in our soul and our mind could we be free.</sentence><sentence id="2268">And just to feel that I had some kind of choices yet to make.</sentence><sentence id="2269">We use to switch, you know, like to share.</sentence><sentence id="2270">I would give Binna a little bit of my soup and she would give me a piece of bread, or vis-a-versa.</sentence><sentence id="2271">One day when she had the .</sentence><sentence id="2272">And even sisters and mothers, sometimes, if they were lucky to be together, they kept separate the plate, everybody would, they would measure when they divided.</sentence><sentence id="2273">You shouldn't be a hair bigger than the other because the starvation was so great.</sentence><sentence id="2274">Binna and I trusted each other and we kept together our bread.</sentence><sentence id="2275">We didn't keep it separate and she never betrayed me, or vice-a-versa.</sentence><sentence id="2276">And somehow knowing, she became the, next to my family, she became the friend that I kept with.</sentence><sentence id="2277">When other friends in concentration, but Binna and I were more like friends, under such circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="2278">And when the day that they usually begun, when the whistle would blow, get up.</sentence><sentence id="2279">And we would always, it was still dark.</sentence><sentence id="2280">I didn't have a clock because as I said, my only worldly possession was the shift, the wooden clog and the bowl.</sentence><sentence id="2281">Nothing else.</sentence><sentence id="2282">So I didn't have a watch, I didn't know what day it is, I didn't have a calendar.</sentence><sentence id="2283">We didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="2284">People say, did you have this?</sentence><sentence id="2285">So that's why I'm pointing out, I didn't have more than this...</sentence><sentence id="2288">4 Tape 3</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2384">Q: You were beginning to tell me what an average day or a typical day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was like for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2386">A: We didn't wake up by the clock.</sentence><sentence id="2387">We woke up, until this day I don't know what time, I know it was still dark.</sentence><sentence id="2388">We would wake up and didn't have to dress because I slept in the shift, the same shift that we wore during the day.</sentence><sentence id="2389">We didn't have any extra clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2390">This was all that we had.</sentence><sentence id="2391">And there was water but we were told that this is not good drinking water.</sentence><sentence id="2392">So water was very scarce.</sentence><sentence id="2393">We didn't have, we couldn't go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> when we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2394">It was like a collective <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, like the latrines you know?</sentence><sentence id="2395">And it was just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wooden board</span> and in it like cut out a piece.</sentence><sentence id="2396">So we couldn't go where we wanted and this was a terrible thing because certain people, sometimes out of, there was such a terrible thirst or a hunger, that sometimes they would eat things that they shouldn't eat, or drink.</sentence><sentence id="2397">And therefore they got diarrhea.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And because the conditions, we couldn't wash up.</sentence><sentence id="2399">We didn't have anywhere to wash.</sentence><sentence id="2400">So it wasn't clean.</sentence><sentence id="2401">And once you got the diarrhea, that was the end of you, because when you have diarrhea you have to run a lot and they wouldn't let you go and work.</sentence><sentence id="2402">And if you soiled yourself, then when they made the selections, then you would go now.</sentence><sentence id="2403">So it was important.</sentence><sentence id="2404">And in order to feel a sense of freedom, since we couldn't wash, I could go through the movements of pretending that I'm washing myself, just to have some, to feel some freedom.</sentence><sentence id="2405">So when I got up in the morning, it was dark and in the summer it was hot, winter was cold, and out of habit I was still saying the , | would still say the prayers, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2406">And we would start, go to the where we are counted.</sentence><sentence id="2407">Alive or dead, we had to be .</sentence><sentence id="2408">And they used the matter that one was responsible for all.</sentence><sentence id="2409">So if one person would not be found because he's sick or wouldn't come out, or whatever, we all had to stand no matter how long.</sentence><sentence id="2410">Rain, in the biggest rain and the frost without a coat, without anything.</sentence><sentence id="2411">If we didn't have, and we would stay, freeze.</sentence><sentence id="2412">So we used to try to warm each other, one in the back, you know somebody would stand, you stay in the front and somebody in the back and embrace each other.</sentence><sentence id="2413">And one day we couldn't do it ultimately because the Nazis, they counted.</sentence><sentence id="2414">And sometimes we would be lucky, that everybody was accounted for.</sentence><sentence id="2415">Other times we would stay for hours.</sentence><sentence id="2416">And then they would give us something, even though we didn't have enough of it and we wish we would have had more, but its suppose to be coffee, it resembled muddy water.</sentence><sentence id="2417">A little beet.</sentence><sentence id="2418">A piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2419">Some kind of smelly cheese, its like Limburger cheese, it was smelly.</sentence><sentence id="2420">But we didn't get enough of it.</sentence><sentence id="2421">We were grateful that we had this here because we were so hungry that we would eat anything almost.</sentence><sentence id="2422">In fact we had to restrain ourselves, sometimes not to eat things which could harm us.</sentence><sentence id="2423">And in the winter, because there was lack of water and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to wash, we would pick up the snow.</sentence><sentence id="2424">And if a Nazi would see us or the one who was watching us, we would get beaten for that.</sentence><sentence id="2425">They tried to torture us.</sentence><sentence id="2426">And then after we got our ration, we had to line up, and I can still hear, "Links."</sentence><sentence id="2427">Line up and go march.</sentence><sentence id="2428">And on both sides big, long <span class="DLF">lines</span> with the prisoners marching, with the inmates marching.</sentence><sentence id="2429">And I don't know how to call ourselves because when they talk about slavery in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> or was not as bad as what we had, yet they don't call them slaves.</sentence><sentence id="2430">So prisoners, I don't know what, but I feel we were worse than slaves because slaves are not condemned to die, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2431">Not that way, they used them for something.</sentence><sentence id="2432">And we started to walk and on both sides were guards and the Nazis with the dogs, that went with us to work.</sentence><sentence id="2433">And then we had to go through the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, and at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> many times was a dren-dall (ph), they would take out somebody who didn't walk too good or didn't look to good.</sentence><sentence id="2434">Other times we were just called, 1-2-3, 5-6-7, the 8" out, sometimes the 10" out, we never know.</sentence><sentence id="2435">So you could not plan from one second to the other because you don't know whether you come back, would you be alive the next day.</sentence><sentence id="2436">That's when I realized how a person was condemned to death, you know, who has a family illness</sentence><sentence id="2438">5 must feel.</sentence><sentence id="2439">And I found out pretty soon that it was more dangerous to walk on the <span class="DLF">outside line</span> so we tried to be in the <span class="DLF">inside line</span> and not to be the very first or the very last.</sentence><sentence id="2440">The less visible you could make yourself.</sentence><sentence id="2441">And we marched.</sentence><sentence id="2442">When I came I was assigned to <span class="BUILDING">Block 8</span> and a Turkish woman was our Block Elster (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2443">A Block Elster (ph) had a little more privileges than the others, she didn't have to go out to work but she was responsible.</sentence><sentence id="2444">And then we went out to work and I cannot estimate how long of time or how many miles because I had no way of measuring, but I know we worked snow, winter, sunshine, it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="2445">And then we came to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2446">And we always worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2447">And, outer-commando (ph) it was called, when you worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, outer-commando (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2448">And what I started to realize is that the work we were doing at that time was not usual work.</sentence><sentence id="2449">We would take stones or gravel and carry it from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the Nazis used to mock us.</sentence><sentence id="2450">And point to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and they said, "See?</sentence><sentence id="2451">That's where you're all going to come out."</sentence><sentence id="2452">And then he said, "Where is your God now?"</sentence><sentence id="2453">And that's when I remembered what my mother told me, when I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">root cellar</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="2454">Go, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yit-cola</span> (ph), go.</sentence><sentence id="2455">God is in the <span class="INT_SPACE">root cellar</span> too."</sentence><sentence id="2456">And I said to myself, "Go, Yit-cola (ph), go.</sentence><sentence id="2457">You're the last one of your family.</sentence><sentence id="2458">If you don't survive, the world will not know and it will be the last.</sentence><sentence id="2459">It's like your family will not have existed.</sentence><sentence id="2460">Go.</sentence><sentence id="2461"><span class="NPIP">God</span> is here too.</sentence><sentence id="2462">But man is not here. [</sentence><sentence id="2463">humanness] is not here."</sentence><sentence id="2464">And I started to understand what means, why my parents stressed it so much.</sentence><sentence id="2465">And I never for once felt like God has failed me.</sentence><sentence id="2466">I felt the people failed me.</sentence><sentence id="2467">Because God gives men choices to do good or evil.</sentence><sentence id="2468">But they have chosen and they were the educated people.</sentence><sentence id="2469">My family always stressed education. .</sentence><sentence id="2470">In fact, my family used to say that is the highest form of religion, science and achievement.</sentence><sentence id="2471">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I had a chance to find out that this was true.</sentence><sentence id="2472">Because Mengelia has doctoral degrees.</sentence><sentence id="2473">And he's responsible for the death of 400,000 people including my own family.</sentence><sentence id="2474">So I did not doubt God.</sentence><sentence id="2475">In spite of what was happening, that I still pray to God and I still believed in God and I remembered other things, which I didn't mentioned this story and I think I will now because I thought of that story often.</sentence><sentence id="2476">You know, for Passover and Rash-sha-shona (ph) every year, regardless of how poor you were, or rich, people would get new clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2477">It didn't matter whether you had a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2478">And most, and there was not big <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> like this here, so mostly we would go to the dressmaker to make a dress.</sentence><sentence id="2479">That particular summer, I was like in my pre-teens, and I remember my mother ordered for me navy blue .</sentence><sentence id="2480">And the dressmaker made me a dress, a two- piece dress, a sailor dress, a pleated skirt with the collar like this.</sentence><sentence id="2481">And when we went to try on first the measurements and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2482">And then when the dress was ready I would try it on again and look in the mirror and it fit well.</sentence><sentence id="2483">And I felt so proud, so happy with this dress.</sentence><sentence id="2484">The sailor dress.</sentence><sentence id="2485">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and it was early Passover, before Passover.</sentence><sentence id="2486">So, like a child, I wanted to put on the dress and to show my girlfriends what a pretty dress, I was so proud of it.</sentence><sentence id="2487">And when I was going to put on the dress, my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please don't put on the dress now."</sentence><sentence id="2488">I said, "Oh Mom, it's gonna..." She said, "It might get tore and it might get stains and then you won't have it for Passover."</sentence><sentence id="2489">And I said, "Oh Mom, its going to be okay."</sentence><sentence id="2490">So I remember my mother said to me, "Yit-cola (ph), please.</sentence><sentence id="2491">Don't take chances on something you can't afford to lose."</sentence><sentence id="2492">But as a child I started to nudge, oh please and please and please.</sentence><sentence id="2493">So finally my mother said, she says, "Well, you learn about responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="2494">That's the only way you're going to learn."</sentence><sentence id="2495">And I promised I won't, I'll be careful.</sentence><sentence id="2496">And I had every intentions of doing it, it was not out of mischief or not caring.</sentence><sentence id="2497">And I put on the dress and I came out.</sentence><sentence id="2498">And I was very, a combination.</sentence><sentence id="2499">In one <span class="NPIP">way</span> I could be very serious and I was very playful and a little tomboy and I remember I mentioned to you that we had the , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2500">And we use to go there, it had beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2501">And the kids came and somebody challenged, they said, "Who can climb up highest on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2502">And I was</sentence><sentence id="2504">6 pretty good at that, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2505">I was never heavy, which actually in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that was not looked at favorably.</sentence><sentence id="2506">They use to say that she has consumption if you were thin.</sentence><sentence id="2507">People were more, so anyhow, in no time I climbed up this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, and I was, I dissed the person who was challenging me.</sentence><sentence id="2508">And all of a sudden I hear somebody say, "Yit-cola (ph), Yit-cola (ph) your mother is coming."</sentence><sentence id="2509">And I got scared and I remembered, my gosh, I'm wearing the good dress.</sentence><sentence id="2510">And I went to get off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> fast and the skirt, the pleated skirt got caught in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branch</span> and I tore the skirt.</sentence><sentence id="2511">I came down.</sentence><sentence id="2512">My mother wasn't even there, it was just a prank they played on me.</sentence><sentence id="2513">And I was in tears.</sentence><sentence id="2514">And I said, "My God.</sentence><sentence id="2515">My mother begged me not to take chances.</sentence><sentence id="2516">Not to take a chance to lose something and now my dress is torn."</sentence><sentence id="2517">And I remember like today, I took the pleats and I folded it over so it wouldn't show my flesh, because it was a big tear.</sentence><sentence id="2518">And when I came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with tears in my eyes, my mother looked at me, she didn't have to ask much.</sentence><sentence id="2519">All she said, "Take of the skirt."</sentence><sentence id="2520">Because she saw the way I held it with tears in my eyes, so she put two and two together. "</sentence><sentence id="2521">And I'll fix it for you."</sentence><sentence id="2522">But she said, "Remember one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2523">It's up to you.</sentence><sentence id="2524">You can wear your old dress or the dress that I'll fix for you.</sentence><sentence id="2525">But you're going to go to <span class="BUILDING">services</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2526">I was crying my eyes out because I didn't want to wear my old dress and I didn't want everybody to see that, what I did with this dress.</sentence><sentence id="2527">But I remembered the lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2528">Because my father always pointed out, in everything there is a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2529">In every <span class="NPIP">experience</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2530">And what I remembered from that lesson is not to take chances with something I cannot afford to lose.</sentence><sentence id="2531">And this was for me a terrific lesson because I knew one thing I cannot afford in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, is to lose my life.</sentence><sentence id="2532">So what I tried to do, many think rather than to take chances like grabbing a little soup, you know, although I was starved, I said no.</sentence><sentence id="2533">I don't want to take chances because if they catch me they can kill me or beat me up so badly and if I cannot work they'll take me away.</sentence><sentence id="2534">And I started to realize there how important it is, the upbringing, the influences that I had and the lessons I had.</sentence><sentence id="2535">And mostly I saw, you see before the Holocaust I had no frame of reference with which to compare the things, the values, and the things or the blessings that I had.</sentence><sentence id="2536">And then I had a chance to see what it is to be without a family, without a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, without the , we were always Jewish there, but we were not, Jewish people were not the only people who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2537">There were Gypsies, there were Jehovah Witness, there were the Polish people, they were from all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2538">However, the Jewish, we, the Jewish girls, we were not together with the men in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2539">The Polish girls were not together in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="2540">We were separated.</sentence><sentence id="2541">So in all the years that I was there, I never had any contact with a man.</sentence><sentence id="2542">I'm not talking in a sexual way, but I mean even to be friends or to be in the company of men.</sentence><sentence id="2543">And here, this is my teen-age years.</sentence><sentence id="2544">The price of going to 5 the price of higher education that I was dreaming, to get a good, formal education.</sentence><sentence id="2545">The price of all the things, of liberty, which I started to realize how important freedom is.</sentence><sentence id="2546">Our liberty.</sentence><sentence id="2547">And this is when, when I felt all this here, then I felt, oh I wish I had a pencil and paper so I could write down how I feel.</sentence><sentence id="2548">But I didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="2549">And at that time, I wrote in my head to past time, to forget, to run away from the harsh reality.</sentence><sentence id="2550">So I remembered that I wrote a poem in my mind and it was what I felt and it was, I feel like a bird with clipped wings, tied to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> by invisible strings, chained to a destiny I did not chose, I feel like a prisoner that cannot break loose, I look at the <span class="DLF">sky</span> with a heavy sigh, but my wings have been clipped and I no longer can fly.</sentence><sentence id="2551">And I was looking out and seeing the physical surroundings.</sentence><sentence id="2552">Around us was the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2553">The smoke constantly above our heads and beneath us was mud.</sentence><sentence id="2554">There was so much mud there that when we wore those wooden clogs, sometimes they got stuck in the mud and the feet got wet and on cold, winter days they, for a long time you couldn't even take them off, if the feet got frozen, the bite, frost bite, and then after a day like this of suffering and on the job they would mock us, they would beat us.</sentence><sentence id="2555">We could not, we were not allowed to help each other.</sentence><sentence id="2556">And the useless</sentence><sentence id="2558">7 words.</sentence><sentence id="2559">And I was thinking to myself, my gosh, if this is, if this is our , 1 don't even have the word to express it, its like a different <span class="NPIP">planet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2560">It's in the same world like a different <span class="NPIP">planet</span>, a planet of destruction, of death.</sentence><sentence id="2561">The dead were not buried and was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, everything was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2562">Mountains of dead bodies until they buried them.</sentence><sentence id="2563">And constant living under the fear of maybe today they are going to take you away, and if you got sick you had no luck, there was no medication.</sentence><sentence id="2564">Everything that they promised was not.</sentence><sentence id="2565">And once I found out what they do with the people who come, that they take away, and I heard music playing.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And I asked somebody, "Where is the music?"</sentence><sentence id="2567">And that's when I found out that they have a live orchestra playing.</sentence><sentence id="2568">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was coming and they made selections, sending away people to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, the music was playing.</sentence><sentence id="2569">Classical music.</sentence><sentence id="2570">And later, when I heard the music, I always started to cry because I knew that my people are burning, the music is playing.</sentence><sentence id="2571">And you know, even after the Holocaust I always loved music and singing, but for a long time whenever I start to hear music, I started to cry because the visions of the little children, of everything separated and how they tore apart.</sentence><sentence id="2572">And then, after a long day, again, walking through the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, the selections.</sentence><sentence id="2573">Some people got beaten to death.</sentence><sentence id="2574">Other people from working were injured, some people got sick.</sentence><sentence id="2575">And every day there became lesser and lesser of us.</sentence><sentence id="2576">And the bodies, more skeletal.</sentence><sentence id="2577">And we didn't, couldn't take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or anything and we started to accumulate lice.</sentence><sentence id="2578">So a big treat was when we could take off that dress and try to to expose of the lice.</sentence><sentence id="2579">And people with diarrhea, and it was just Dante's Inferno is a comedy comparing to what it was.</sentence><sentence id="2580">That's what I say because you ask me, did I, it's impossible to describe everything.</sentence><sentence id="2581">So we came back tired, frozen, cold, over heated from the heat in the whole day, we came back, again the appeal (ph), say appeal (ph) and check there, there to alive, we are there.</sentence><sentence id="2582">And then we had to wait, after they count again they give us a little soup, a little bread.</sentence><sentence id="2583">It wasn't enough to live and not enough to die.</sentence><sentence id="2584">And many people, many, constantly people died.</sentence><sentence id="2585">And seeing, here you was with somebody, a few minutes later they were gone.</sentence><sentence id="2586">And constantly new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, and you couldn't speak.</sentence><sentence id="2587">So, and the filth, the starvation, the loneliness.</sentence><sentence id="2588">Like I started before to tell you, is all this time not seeing yourself in a mirror, not having a toothbrush.</sentence><sentence id="2589">They tried to dehumanize us to the point where we didn't even, I'm embarrassed to talk about it, but when I remember what my parents taught me, that my does not depend on how other treat me but how I treat others, than I'm not ashamed because I haven't done anything to deserve it.</sentence><sentence id="2590">We didn't even have a piece of toilet tissue.</sentence><sentence id="2591">All the time I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I couldn't have a piece of toilet tissue.</sentence><sentence id="2592">This is how they deprived us.</sentence><sentence id="2593">Not a spoon, not a fork, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2594">You know, they tried to reduce us to be like non-humans.</sentence><sentence id="2595">And the mocking constantly and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2596">So again, each day the same thing, over and over, starting the and just hanging on another day.</sentence><sentence id="2597">Just if you could get through the day, not get beaten, not go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, go through the day and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> together with Binna, that's .</sentence><sentence id="2598">And many times, people would go in the evening and somebody would say, "Listen, I'm going to give you a little of my soup.</sentence><sentence id="2599">You want to give me a piece of your bread?"</sentence><sentence id="2600">Some people preferred the, a little soup to the bread.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And the starvation.</sentence><sentence id="2602">And then the Nazis would come and they would say that they are going to give us extra bread, who wants to have extra bread?</sentence><sentence id="2603">And I learned very quickly, whenever they called for volunteers for something, I never wanted to volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="2604">I felt, others suffered but I don't want to get involved to do something which wouldn't be , you know?</sentence><sentence id="2605">And what I found out one time, they took, they made a selection.</sentence><sentence id="2606">They gave, it was true, they did give this time a little more bread, but they took away the girls and not until after the war, one who was taken away and survived, I found out that they took them for experiments.</sentence><sentence id="2607">And they, the doctors experimented without anesthesia.</sentence><sentence id="2608">You

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4627">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="4628">Because on the 26" I was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="4629">On the 27" I was in Copenhagen.</sentence><sentence id="4630">The 28" J arrived.</sentence><sentence id="4631">And at that time, when I started to get healthy I started to examine and to re-evaluate everything.</sentence><sentence id="4632">What is it?</sentence><sentence id="4633">Who is responsible?</sentence><sentence id="4634">And basically what I was interested is, in the beginning, to regain my health.</sentence><sentence id="4635">I started concentrating on regaining my health because I realize that health is wealth, health is important because if you're sick and you are alone, you cannot do very much.</sentence><sentence id="4636">And I was very much aware that I no longer have anyone to love me, to protect me, to take care of me.</sentence><sentence id="4637">So I needed to become my own parent and start taking care of myself.</sentence><sentence id="4638">Of course, Binna and I were still very devoted and very loyal to each other and we were each other's family at the time.</sentence><sentence id="4639">And I was there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I got very good care.</sentence><sentence id="4640">I also was always fortunately a good student and always loved language, words.</sentence><sentence id="4641">I always realized the power of words, so I was very eager to learn Swedish.</sentence><sentence id="4642">So while there, I started, they were very kind to me, they gave me a dictionary and I started to learn a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="4643">And to recover.</sentence><sentence id="4644">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lund</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> until May 7, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="4645">From there I was sent to Dod-ug-stup (ph) in <span

in Swedish is called .</sentence><sentence id="4648">On <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rinks-vagen</span> (ph) 20 B, that was the address.</sentence><sentence id="4649">Now there we were in a <span class="DLF">quarantine</span>, we still couldn't go out because the people were afraid, if we are, if we don't carry any diseases or, so we were not treated badly, in fact we were treated very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4650">However, we only got 50 cents a week, it's 50 , which is like 50 cents here, for pocket money.</sentence><sentence id="4651">And we started, the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> came to the, there was also a <span class="DLF">fence</span>, but was not <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, it was not <span class="DLF">electrocuted wires</span>, and we would come to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and they looked.</sentence><sentence id="4652">Some came and we would give them sometimes the money and ask them to buy little trinkets for us.</sentence><sentence id="4653">And there was a couple with a young son, must have been maybe early 20's, and with the few words that I could speak we made contact.</sentence><sentence id="4654">I already recovered a little bit, looked a little better.</sentence><sentence id="4655">And I didn't think of myself at that time as a woman yet, but obviously he thought of</sentence><sentence id="4657">4 me that way, and he asked me, and in the broken Swedish with the dictionary, I understood that when I get allowed, when I will be allowed to get out from the quarantine, will I go on a date with him.</sentence><sentence id="4658">And that was the first date of my life, okay?</sentence><sentence id="4659">So I was very excited and anxious.</sentence><sentence id="4660">I didn't know how I'm going to know how to behave with a man, I didn't see a man for all those years.</sentence><sentence id="4661">I didn't have any experience in dating and mating.</sentence><sentence id="4662">I went out with him.</sentence><sentence id="4663">It was a very, very painful experience for me.</sentence><sentence id="4664">Because as soon as we started to talk, and not very much, he paid me a compliment, you don't look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4665">And that was like a knife in my, twisted in my heart.</sentence><sentence id="4666">Here I suffered so much and I'm not Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="4667">And again, he doesn't see me as a human being.</sentence><sentence id="4668">Yes, I'm not denying my Jewishness, I'm proud to be who I am.</sentence><sentence id="4669">Would I be born a Gentile, I would be proud to be Gentile, but I'm born, I didn't make choices about this.</sentence><sentence id="4670">It hit me so hard, and I don't believe he meant it in a bad way, in a malicious way.</sentence><sentence id="4671">He was a kind person.</sentence><sentence id="4672">But for somehow he reminded me who I am, not that I ever forgot it.</sentence><sentence id="4673">And I said, "Good-bye."</sentence><sentence id="4674">Excuse myself with tears in my eyes and I left.</sentence><sentence id="4675">And I made a decision.</sentence><sentence id="4676">Never will I go out with somebody who is not Jewish because I'm the only link left, the only daughter left of my family.</sentence><sentence id="4677">I cannot do it to my family or to my people or to myself.</sentence><sentence id="4678">And in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP Camp</span>, was a woman which was called, we called her , means she was a Rabbi's wife, so the husband is a Rabbi, she is the Rabbi's wife.</sentence><sentence id="4679">So she was the Rabbi's wife and she was orthodox and she took a great interest, she wanted the children, those who are under 21, to remain Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4680">So she took us, she told us there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that she wanted to take us.</sentence><sentence id="4681">Also, we were not still completely free to go.</sentence><sentence id="4682">A kosher, a camp.</sentence><sentence id="4683">It was no, it was, I prefer kosher to not kosher of course at that time, but it wasn't so much the kosher because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I ate not kosher, so, but it was that I felt I need to be with Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

much."</sentence><sentence id="5298">And, I don't know, I never talked with him about love because I certainly didn't love him.</sentence><sentence id="5299">I loved him as a human being, as a good person, but no otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="5300">And I remember that Binna said, "Oh, I would be lucky to find a man like this."</sentence><sentence id="5301">And, "Why don't you marry him?"</sentence><sentence id="5302">And I said, "You like him, you marry him."</sentence><sentence id="5303">Anyhow, I didn't marry him and Avram, in Yiddish we actually called him Avrum because we spoke Yiddish, he received, found out that he has two sisters who live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, who survived.</sentence><sentence id="5304">I don't know where, I don't know too much about those things.</sentence><sentence id="5305">And they send him a visa.</sentence><sentence id="5306">And I could have gone with him to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> but I did not want to go.</sentence><sentence id="5307">Because I said, I'm not going to negate myself in any way.</sentence><sentence id="5308">If I'm going to marry someone it's going to be somebody who I have deep feelings for.</sentence><sentence id="5309">Love not only as a friend but as a : And anyhow, one time, Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) comes up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he tells me, he invites me to come to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5310">I got so angry.</sentence><sentence id="5311">I said, "After knowing me so long don't you know I'm not the kind of girl that doesn't go to a <span class="INT_SPACE">man's apartment</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="5312">You know, we were brought up, you had to be a virgin when you got married, it's not like today, you know?</sentence><sentence id="5313">And he said, "Sha- sha, I'm not just inviting you.</sentence><sentence id="5314">I'm inviting Binna too and there are going to be other people."</sentence><sentence id="5315">And I didn't know at that time yet what's, and I came.</sentence><sentence id="5316">And this was either June 24, 1946, yes, it was already 1946.</sentence><sentence id="5317">June 26 or, I think it was June the 24" in 1946, and I come to the party and as I come in with Binna, there are lots of guests, and I didn't know that this was the party for his, farewell patty, good-bye party, bon voyage party.</sentence><sentence id="5318">He was leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5319">And as I come in a man sits</sentence><sentence id="5321">0 there and as soon as | look at him and he looks at me, he moves a little bit and makes <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and says to me in Polish, "Please sit here."</sentence><sentence id="5322">And I sit down next to him, and from the first moment, I care deeply about him.</sentence><sentence id="5323">And I started to get worried, what about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Binna</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5324">And he, I found out later that Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) and this man, and I'll tell you later who he was, knew each other from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and the man that this man came with was also from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5325">From Bell-hot-off (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5326">They're all survivors and they knew each other from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they went from .</sentence><sentence id="5327">And found out later that there were even some cousins also between these men.</sentence><sentence id="5328">And he, what I found later out, that he knew already that I am not going to get involved with him so he said to his friend, "If she cannot be for me at least let her be for you."</sentence><sentence id="5329">Because he considered me to be okay, I don't know what he thought about me, but he wanted me to get a nice man.</sentence><sentence id="5330">And the person that I met there was Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph), my husband.</sentence><sentence id="5331">And after, and he ask me can he take us <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5332">So I said to him, "You came with your friend.</sentence><sentence id="5333">Why don't you invite him too and we'll go together?"</sentence><sentence id="5334">Because I wanted for Binna to have somebody, to make Y= you know how is, to be the matchmaker.</sentence><sentence id="5335">And he said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="5336">And they want to go upstairs and I said, "No, it's too late.</sentence><sentence id="5337">After a certain hour nobody comes to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5338">So he said, "Promise me that you're going to wait for me."</sentence><sentence id="5339">He worked in shifts from morning until 2:00 and from 2:00 to 11:00.</sentence><sentence id="5340">That I'm going to wait.</sentence><sentence id="5341">He got a job and the other man was , which turned out later to be Binna's husband.</sentence><sentence id="5342">And he said to come, will we wait for him?</sentence><sentence id="5343">And I agreed.</sentence><sentence id="5344">Anyhow, I met him a couple of times and started to date Binna too.</sentence><sentence id="5345">And one time, Rockmiel (ph) says to me, "Do you know a girl, her name is Manya Mo-nes-ka (ph)?"</sentence><sentence id="5346">And I said, "By sight I don't know much about her.</sentence><sentence id="5347">I just know she's a pretty girl.</sentence><sentence id="5348">That's all I know about her, from sight.</sentence><sentence id="5349">Why are you asking?"</sentence><sentence id="5350">And he tells me that her brother was with him from where he came from, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and he asked him to meet his sister.</sentence><sentence id="5351">He wanted to make a match.</sentence><sentence id="5352">He didn't tell me at the time though that he gave him a letter, he really was trying to make a match.</sentence><sentence id="5353">So I said, "Why don't you go?"</sentence><sentence id="5354">And Binna kicks me under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, she said, "Are you crazy?</sentence><sentence id="5355">You're going to send a cat for .</sentence><sentence id="5356">You like him so much and you're going to send him to another girl?"</sentence><sentence id="5357">I said. "</sentence><sentence id="5358">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="5359">If he likes her better, it's better he makes the choice now than later."</sentence><sentence id="5360">And she didn't like that so she sent .</sentence><sentence id="5361">He came back and he said, "Now we can get engaged."</sentence><sentence id="5362">So a week later, after I met him, I was engaged.</sentence><sentence id="5363">And on July 13, 1946, before Avrum Schmol-lev-itz (ph) left to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, we had a double wedding.</sentence><sentence id="5364">Binna married Mendal Crook (ph) and I married Rockmiel Zygmuntowicz (ph).</sentence><sentence id="5365">That was the happiest and the most tragic day of my life.</sentence><sentence id="5366">Happy because obviously I love my husband, we loved each other.</sentence><sentence id="5367">But he is the sole survivor of a large family.</sentence><sentence id="5368">He was one of seven.</sentence><sentence id="5369">Only one sister died before the Holocaust and the rest of his family didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="5370">And I was the sole survivor of my family.</sentence><sentence id="5371">At least he had three at his wedding.</sentence><sentence id="5372">I didn't have one single person from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5373">One single person who knew me.</sentence><sentence id="5374">My family.</sentence><sentence id="5375">And I remembered that when my, when we lived in Check-hon-off (ph), we used to, I mentioned before that we were kosher, so we would buy chickens, ducks, geese.</sentence><sentence id="5376">And from the chicken feathers we took to the ritual slaughter and then they would pluck, it wasn't ready-made like here, so all the other feathers they threw away.</sentence><sentence id="5377">But from the geese and from the ducks, they would save it.</sentence><sentence id="5378">The down.</sentence><sentence id="5379">And this was suppose to be for a trousseau, for Yit-cola (ph), when she's going to get married.</sentence><sentence id="5380">And whenever they had a wish, they said they should live to see me under the , which means under the canopy.</sentence><sentence id="5381">And here I was all alone.</sentence><sentence id="5382">I had no one.</sentence><sentence id="5383">And it hit me.</sentence><sentence id="5384">The only person I had is my husband, Binna and , who was my dear friend.,</sentence><sentence id="5385">bless his memory, he is no longer alive, he died several years ago.</sentence><sentence id="5386">And at our wedding, I had a borrowed dress.</sentence><sentence id="5387">I didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="5388">We married deliberately during vacation,</sentence><sentence id="5390">1 the week of vacation, because we didn't have enough money for the next week.</sentence><sentence id="5391">And on our honeymoon, we didn't go anyplace and we cooked a big pot of soup.</sentence><sentence id="5392">And for a whole week, the four of us shared.</sentence><sentence id="5393">This was our condition in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="5394">And yet, I've tried to make a go of it and Binna and I made a switch.</sentence><sentence id="5395">I shared with her my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and Mandle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) shared a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when they came from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5396">So Binna went to live where Rockmiel (ph) lived with Mendle (ph) and Mendle (ph) moved in with me and Binna moved out, in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5397">You don't understand?</sentence><sentence id="5398">I had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I shared with Binna before I was married.</sentence><sentence id="5399">Mendle (ph) and Rockmiel (ph) came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5400">So when we got married, so Binna went to live with Mendle (ph), it was her husband.</sentence><sentence id="5401">And I lived with Rockmiel (ph).</sentence><sentence id="5402">But there is something that, it's a curious thing, because I learn a lot from people.</sentence><sentence id="5403">When an engagement we made, I didn't know too many people.</sentence><sentence id="5404">So there was only Binna and Mendle (ph), Rockmeil (ph) and I, Avram, and two girls that I met in Boss (ph), that I didn't know from before.</sentence><sentence id="5405">One girl tells, who was invited there, Rose Lift-ka (ph) she was called at that time, I don't know what's her, she was married, and she was very anxious to get married.</sentence><sentence id="5406">She was a lot older and there wasn't any boys to marry, the girls were worried that they won't find, and not everybody wanted to marry out of their religion.</sentence><sentence id="5407">So anyhow, we had a tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5408">All there was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is two single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5409">I didn't even have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so we went to going from the <span class="DLF">steps</span>, to go up to the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, I took a little, made a little curtain or drape and I bought a hot plate.</sentence><sentence id="5410">And that's how I cooked.</sentence><sentence id="5411">And from the sink that we used.</sentence><sentence id="5412">But I was satisfied.</sentence><sentence id="5413">So I went out to bring in the food.</sentence><sentence id="5414">Anyhow, this girl says to me, I introduce my fiancee when we got engaged, and she says to me, "Yit-cola (ph), he's not for you."</sentence><sentence id="5415">And I said, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="5416">And she said, "He's too big a flirt."</sentence><sentence id="5417">And I think to myself, wait a minute, I only deal with facts.</sentence><sentence id="5418">How would she know what he is, she just met him?</sentence><sentence id="5419">She would say he's not attractive, she can see, but how can she know he's a flirt?</sentence><sentence id="5420">He's never, she never met him before.</sentence><sentence id="5421">So I just ignored.</sentence><sentence id="5422">After we were married, my husband asked me, "Are you good friends?"</sentence><sentence id="5423">And I said, "Just met her."</sentence><sentence id="5424">But I had no one else and I wanted somebody to be with us at our engagement.</sentence><sentence id="5425">So he said, "Did you know that when you went out to , She invited me to come to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> without you?"</sentence><sentence id="5426">I'm going to cook for you, I'm going to do this.</sentence><sentence id="5427">And I thought to myself, you see how important is the thing for yourself.</sentence><sentence id="5428">To think what people say and use your own common sense.</sentence><sentence id="5429">This is why I'm telling you the story.</sentence><sentence id="5430">Anyhow, we were married and eventually my husband was working very hard.</sentence><sentence id="5431">And Mendle (ph) told me how hard he's working so I was upset about it so I went and I gave up the job I had, which was that I could have, because, that he should be able to get a better job.</sentence><sentence id="5432">And I should get <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, to get a little bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5433">And we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we didn't have anything, we started without anything.</sentence><sentence id="5434">But we understood that it's a beginning and we worked hard.</sentence><sentence id="5435">And then in 1948, and for a long time I was worried whether I'll be able to bear a child.</sentence><sentence id="5436">Because I didn't get the period yet for so long.</sentence><sentence id="5437">Finally I got the period.</sentence><sentence id="5438">And anyhow, we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5439">And you know, I'm telling you those stories because I'm seeing that all over, in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and in every religion, and even in every <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, there can be people who are good or not so good.</sentence><sentence id="5440">So anyhow, we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and this, in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from this lady, I had another job, she told me from the beginning that I'm not allowed to have any children in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5441">Because there were only living people without children.</sentence><sentence id="5442">Mostly elderly people.</sentence><sentence id="5443">And she put in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5444">And one time, at night, I hear somebody is opening the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5445">She came to check if we are sleeping together, and here I am married.</sentence><sentence id="5446">And I always, I don't know so much about how I was when I was real young, but as far as I can remember, I was taught to think for myself and to trust myself.</sentence><sentence id="5447">And my parents always gave me confidence, you know, that I had that, that I was able to trust myself.</sentence><sentence id="5448">So I figured, let her say</sentence><sentence id="5450">2 what she wants.</sentence><sentence id="5451">I didn't argue, I didn't talk back.</sentence><sentence id="5452">And it so happen that that's when I got pregnant, in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5453">But I knew, as soon as it will be shown she will make me miserable.</sentence><sentence id="5454">So again, I had to switch because I didn't want it to have, to worry, and somebody hear, so many of my people were murdered.</sentence><sentence id="5455">And here, I had worried for so long, if I'll be able to bear a child.</sentence><sentence id="5456">Here I'm pregnant and somebody looking down on me or not permitting me to have a child.</sentence><sentence id="5457">I need her permission?</sentence><sentence id="5458">So I started to look for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to get, to keep the moving again.</sentence><sentence id="5459">Anyhow, when, before, when I moved into another, when I was pregnant I moved to another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5460">And I didn't know anything about how the human body works.</sentence><sentence id="5461">A woman's body.</sentence><sentence id="5462">And the doctor just told me the date, when to expect.</sentence><sentence id="5463">And just told me two things, that I'll have pains, bleeding, then it's time to come.</sentence><sentence id="5464">All the time my husband and I was rehearsing.</sentence><sentence id="5465">Where we going to go?</sentence><sentence id="5466">How we going to go?Everything.</sentence><sentence id="5467">It so happened he had still shift work.</sentence><sentence id="5468">And he left in the morning and I woke up and my water bag broke but at that time I didn't know that I had a water bag and I didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="5469">I just saw it's not something that's, not, that I never had before.</sentence><sentence id="5470">So I go in, I don't have a friend, I don't have a family, I don't have anyone that lives near that I can ask.</sentence><sentence id="5471">So I go into a neighbor, to ask her, what does that mean?</sentence><sentence id="5472">She said, "I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="5473">Go ask the doctor."</sentence><sentence id="5474">So she's advising me to go ask the doctor.</sentence><sentence id="5475">My husband is not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I don't have a telephone number.</sentence><sentence id="5476">And here I see something is not right and I don't know what it is.</sentence><sentence id="5477">So I take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I'm going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to ask the doctor.</sentence><sentence id="5478">And here my water bag is broken.</sentence><sentence id="5479">And I came to the doctor and they don't let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="5480">In the meantime, I'm showing you the different influences, how one <span class="NPIP">thing</span> influences the other.</sentence><sentence id="5481">And in the meantime, my husband meets somebody in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they ask him, how is Yit-cola (ph), and he told them that I am expecting the baby.</sentence><sentence id="5482">And here I was a little bit .</sentence><sentence id="5483">Anyhow, and this was already after he knew that I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, that the water bag broke.</sentence><sentence id="5484">And he tells her the story.</sentence><sentence id="5485">So she says, "Well, if the water bag broke and the baby's not born then the baby cannot live."</sentence><sentence id="5486">In the meantime, I gave birth to a healthy boy and my husband comes to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he comes in, I see the uncertainty on his face.</sentence><sentence id="5487">He holds his hands behind his back and not a smile, no emotion.</sentence><sentence id="5488">I said, "What's going on here?"</sentence><sentence id="5489">And I was wondering.</sentence><sentence id="5490">No congratulations, no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="5491">So distant and cold?</sentence><sentence id="5492">I said, that's not my husband.</sentence><sentence id="5493">That's not the man I know.</sentence><sentence id="5494">And I said to him, "Mistletov, we have a son."</sentence><sentence id="5495">And he get so excited and tears are in his eyes, and behind he had a bouquet of flowers but he was afraid to show them because she told him the baby might not live, and he thought maybe it was a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="5496">So I'm showing you, why am I telling you this story?</sentence><sentence id="5497">I had no experience.</sentence><sentence id="5498">I was alone.</sentence><sentence id="5499">That when I needed somebody, a mother, I needed relatives to help me, I had nobody.</sentence><sentence id="5500">You know?</sentence><sentence id="5501">And my son was born October 12, 1948, the same year the State of Israel was born.</sentence><sentence id="5502">Two miracles in my life.</sentence><sentence id="5503">A son and after 2,000 years I lived to see the dream that my people prayed, the State of Israel.</sentence><sentence id="5504">But unfortunately I didn't have relatives to share .</sentence><sentence id="5505">And ever since I've been liberated, I couldn't even tell you the time because usually I know, that I feel, I told you I want to do something, but I couldn't put it in words.</sentence><sentence id="5506">I knew that I had to go back one day to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5507">I never said good-bye to my family.</sentence><sentence id="5508">I just knew that something is still not finished yet.</sentence><sentence id="5509">Anyhow, and I stayed in there.</sentence><sentence id="5510">Then after that I was, started to work, no, the first year we had no choice so we had to take, after my son was about a year, we took him to a <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> because we had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="5511">We needed to work and I was suffering tremendously because I was brought up with two loving women at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and a father.</sentence><sentence id="5512">And, but I had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="5513">And my little boy had an accident.</sentence><sentence id="5514">He was accidentally, you know in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> we still didn't have the modern conveniences so we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, a wood-burning stove, and I was use from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so we washed the diapers and we boiled them.</sentence><sentence id="5515">And I even ironed them.</sentence><sentence id="5516">And one day, by accident, and I always caution him don't go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and the hot water spilled on him.</sentence><sentence id="5517">And I thought that I'm going to</sentence><sentence id="5519">3 lose him so I went with him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5520">I come back to the work, and my boss saw, the first day she didn't say anything, and I wanted to stay, this is our little boy, he's .</sentence><sentence id="5521">And she tells me, "Your personal life is of no concern of mine."</sentence><sentence id="5522">I didn't say anything and I thought to myself, I'm free physically.</sentence><sentence id="5523">Now I have to be independent financially too.</sentence><sentence id="5524">And since my husband had shift and got my child with others, and I started to go to <span class="BUILDING">fashion design school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5525">And I'll show you, I have the diploma.</sentence><sentence id="5526">And I started to work.</sentence><sentence id="5527">And when my second son was born, I no longer had to take him to the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5528">I could be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him.</sentence><sentence id="5529">Now, Binna and I, as I mentioned before, had a double wedding.</sentence><sentence id="5530">She was, before I got pregnant she was pregnant and she miscarried.</sentence><sentence id="5531">So she got pregnant again.</sentence><sentence id="5532">I was early, she was, it turned out that we were, both she and I gave birth in the same <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5533">Her first child was born on October 1, 1948.</sentence><sentence id="5534">My son was born October 10, 1948.</sentence><sentence id="5535">And since in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, so many adjustments.</sentence><sentence id="5536">In Europe, we didn't know about formulas.</sentence><sentence id="5537">So we used to nurse each others children.</sentence><sentence id="5538">We were very close with each other.</sentence><sentence id="5539">Anyhow, then in November 29, 1951 my second son was born, .</sentence><sentence id="5540">And as I said, I no longer needed to go to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but it was very, very difficult because I had, I sewed everything, from little suits for the children, to draperies, to slip covers, to custom and I worked very, very hard.</sentence><sentence id="5541">But I was happy because I could be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the family.</sentence><sentence id="5542">Then I received information that, from the , that we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> if we want to.</sentence><sentence id="5543">And I decided that I'm going to talk with my husband, find out how he feels.</sentence><sentence id="5544">And we both decided.</sentence><sentence id="5545">We're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5926">Q: Why did you want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and leave <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5927">Or not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5941">A: No, we felt there is no, that there, we could have moved, it's not so easy to move.</sentence><sentence id="5942">You have to have a job, you have to move, and you have the circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="5943">We had nothing, we started with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="5944">So we decided, plus, I just felt that too many, you know, in Europe there were too many painful memories.</sentence><sentence id="5945">If they would have given me a choice I surely would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and that time, but I didn't have a choice.</sentence><sentence id="5946">They assigned me to come <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, so on February 15, 1953 we arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">United

to have a larger family.</sentence><sentence id="5948">And we had to make a choice.</sentence><sentence id="5949">And I knew that all life, from the morning you wake up until the time you go to sleep, you make choices.</sentence><sentence id="5950">And I was also taught that every, in every choice there are consequences and there are lessons.</sentence><sentence id="5951">So I had to put my value system to work.</sentence><sentence id="5952">And I said one thing, if I have children I don't want them somebody else to take, I want to be with them.</sentence><sentence id="5953">I want to, I didn't have that privilege because it was not of my choice, my mother would have wanted me, because one of the things which I remembered, very distinctly, is that my mother put aside her, she wanted to be an actress but she put away.</sentence><sentence id="5954">And the family was always first.</sentence><sentence id="5955">And other things which I heard when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is that my mother was pregnant but she had a miscarriage and I was very much the child that she wanted so much and I was loved unconditionally by my parents.</sentence><sentence id="5956">And I felt I don't want to deprive my children of that.</sentence><sentence id="5957">So we decided, my husband and I, as long as we can pay our bills, we'll</sentence><sentence id="5959">4 forego luxuries.</sentence><sentence id="5960">I would never accept a handout from anyone.</sentence><sentence id="5961">We worked hard work.</sentence><sentence id="5962">And I will stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the children .</sentence><sentence id="5963">And then in 1956, November 24, 1956, our son Samuel was born.</sentence><sentence id="5964">Again, I remember that when I was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> people said, where you going to go with a baby?</sentence><sentence id="5965">Or the <span

have everything mapped out every inch of the way.</sentence><sentence id="5971">And we went.</sentence><sentence id="5972">It was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="5973">I came here.</sentence><sentence id="5974">I didn't know a single person in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5975">I didn't know a single word of

but my husband had no marketable skills.</sentence><sentence id="5978">He was working in a <span class="BUILDING">knitting factory</span> making nylon stockings.</sentence><sentence id="5979">But he was willing to work and take it, we went from one, it was very hard because he got a job here when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, he worked in .</sentence><sentence

already asleep.</sentence><sentence id="5982">And I said, no, this won't do.</sentence><sentence id="5983">Because I will never put material possessions above spiritual things, which we need.</sentence><sentence id="5984">So I encouraged him to change the job.</sentence><sentence id="5985">There was an advertisement.</sentence><sentence id="5986">After he worked a few days, they just had a few , they let him go.</sentence><sentence id="5987">So he was taking any kind of job, three, four jobs.</sentence><sentence id="5988">But he would never, we never took anything from anyone.</sentence><sentence id="5989">And we struggled and then on February 21, 1964 our youngest son, Michael, was born.</sentence><sentence id="5990">And I knew that I made the right decision, to stay with the kids at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5991">Because, first of all, it would cost a fortune, four children you have to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and I didn't want to send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because I remembered the beautiful summers that I had in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, picking mushrooms and my mother showing, making crowns and put on your head, and singing, and I don't want them to miss all this here.</sentence><sentence id="5992">I felt that to give them love, because I started to realize that it's the love that I received that I can give to others now.</sentence><sentence id="5993">And that you can survive with very little because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="5994">And after I was married.</sentence><sentence id="5995">Anyhow, when my youngest son was suppose to become barmitzvah, we decided instead for making a big party, his name was Michael, may be rest in peace, that we're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> instead.</sentence><sentence id="5996">And to celebrate his barmitzvah there.</sentence><sentence id="5997">And since I'm an intuitive person, and we decided this already, I wake up one morning and I said to my husband, "Honey, let's go now."</sentence><sentence id="5998">And he said, "When was this born?</sentence><sentence id="5999">Why?"</sentence><sentence id="6000">And I said, "I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="6001">I just now feel we should go now."</sentence><sentence id="6002">And he agreed.</sentence><sentence id="6003">And it was a very good decision.</sentence><sentence id="6004">And we went.</sentence><sentence id="6005">And for the first time I met my cousin Uta (ph), okay?</sentence><sentence id="6006">I was eight years old in 1934 when she left.</sentence><sentence id="6007">I came there in 1974, with my youngest son.</sentence><sentence id="6008">Ours was always a very close knit family and Uta (ph) was thrilled.</sentence><sentence id="6009">We cried in each others arms.</sentence><sentence id="6010">Because she was the sole survivor of her family.</sentence><sentence id="6011">She always felt bad that she left.</sentence><sentence id="6012">She never could come back.</sentence><sentence id="6013">And I remembered my grandmother saying, .</sentence><sentence id="6014">So I was able to go back with my son, to meet my cousin Uta (ph).</sentence><sentence id="6015">And there is <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, there is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="6016">And she gave him for his barmitzvah a and a .</sentence><sentence id="6017">And she asked him, just like my parents called me affectionate, I called my children affectionate, "Michael, what would you like besides this."</sentence><sentence id="6018">He said, "Nothing, I'm just happy to see you."</sentence><sentence id="6019">She says, "No, tell me."</sentence><sentence id="6020">He said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="6021">He wants a little chain, Michael.</sentence><sentence id="6022">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, it didn't take long.</sentence><sentence id="6023">I receive a call.</sentence><sentence id="6024">My cousin Uta (ph) went to the doctor, her check up, and either on the way there or on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, got a heart attack and died.</sentence><sentence id="6025">If I wouldn't have gone then, I already told you what I, my intuition and that I listen to my intuition.</sentence><sentence id="6026">And I would not have seen her.</sentence><sentence id="6027">Anyhow, Michael was a beautiful young man.</sentence><sentence id="6028">He was very successful because he was loved and he had a talent to laugh, a full measure.</sentence><sentence id="6029">I remember when he was a little boy.</sentence><sentence id="6030">He used to ask me, "How come that we don't have family?</sentence><sentence id="6031">How come you have a number?"</sentence><sentence id="6032">And I told him, and the conversations, I wrote it down and then I made a poem</sentence><sentence id="6034">5 from it.</sentence><sentence id="6035">And I remember that when we moved into our first <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, this is my second <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6036">He walked over to a neighbor's, his mother, an elderly lady.</sentence><sentence id="6037">He said, "Lady, I don't have any grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="6038">Would you be my grandmother?"</sentence><sentence id="6039">I'm telling you those things, that it effected not only us, it effected the children.</sentence><sentence id="6040">And she became like his adopted grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="6041">She was very good to him.</sentence><sentence id="6042">She lived to be 96.</sentence><sentence id="6043">Anyhow, Michael and I, and I remember one time, you know he was more than fifteen years between him and my older son.</sentence><sentence id="6044">So he almost grew up like an only child because they were already in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, .</sentence><sentence id="6045">And one time I was sitting and I felt so lonely and I said, "Michael, I need a little medicine."</sentence><sentence id="6046">And I'll never forget his scared look.</sentence><sentence id="6047">And he said, "Ma, are you sick?"</sentence><sentence id="6048">And I said, "Oh, not that kind of medicine.</sentence><sentence id="6049">I need a hug and a kiss."</sentence><sentence id="6050">And he came over and gave me a hug and a kiss and after that he would come over many times, he would say, "Want a little medicine?"</sentence><sentence id="6051">And that became our between us, medicine meant a hug and a kiss.</sentence><sentence id="6052">And when he was already in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, he would always, when I would write to him or call him, I'd say, "Michael, I can't wait to have a little medicine."</sentence><sentence id="6053">And he said, "I can't wait to give it to you."</sentence><sentence id="6054">And he was very successful because he was loved by many people.</sentence><sentence id="6055">He was successful in <span

"</sentence><sentence id="6460">What's the matter?</sentence><sentence id="6461">Why so late?"</sentence><sentence id="6462">At that time I realized, I had a chance to sort out my emotions, and I realized that if I answer in anger he is controlling me emotionally.</sentence><sentence id="6463">So I looked at him very calmly and I said, "Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="6464">I am so glad that you missed me."</sentence><sentence id="6465">And he answered, "You know I like you Yit-cola (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="6466">And I said, "Thank you" again.</sentence><sentence id="6467">This man, may he rest in peace, is no longer alive.</sentence><sentence id="6468">He was otherwise a good man, but he had a habit of putting some people down.</sentence><sentence id="6469">And I have noticed that volubility illicits aggression in the group, compassion in the kind, and silence in the indifferent.</sentence><sentence id="6470">And this is nothing to do with race, color or religion.</sentence><sentence id="6471">It has to do with the ability of self image, of confidence, of the ability to love yourself because you cannot love others if you don't love yourself.</sentence><sentence id="6472">And to care.</sentence><sentence id="6473">To know that what we do effects not only us, it effects others too.</sentence><sentence id="6474">Because after the Holocaust, I was thinking many times, you know I told you I like to write, and I was thinking up to age 13 most decisions my parents and grandmother made for me.</sentence><sentence id="6475">You know children don't make where to live and what to do, of course I had some.</sentence><sentence id="6476">During the Holocaust I couldn't make choices about my life.</sentence><sentence id="6477">Even after</sentence><sentence id="6479">8 the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="6480">Okay, I could have said no, I don't want to come here.</sentence><sentence id="6481">But I didn't have many choices.</sentence><sentence id="6482">I could say, I come, I don't come, but I couldn't say I want to go someplace else because the .</sentence><sentence id="6483">So I felt that so much in my life I had to live and to do by choices which others made that effected me.</sentence><sentence id="6484">And I sat down once and I wrote just a few words.</sentence><sentence id="6485">And it goes like this: Four groups of people Dramatically influence my destiny.</sentence><sentence id="6486">My late, beloved family in Check-hon-off (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> Who knew me and loved me and empowered me with positive energy.</sentence><sentence id="6487">Hitler's Nazis who didn't know me But hated me merely for being born Jewish and in one, single day Murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> my entire family.</sentence><sentence id="6488">The bystanders, who knew but didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="6489">And the Swedish Red Cross, who didn't know me but liberated me From Nazi tyranny and brought me to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6490">Iam one and the same person.</sentence><sentence id="6491">If four different groups of people viewed me differently, And treated me differently, I was loved for who I am And I was hated and starved and tortured for who I am.</sentence><sentence id="6492">The more the Nazis tortured me for who I am The more I was determined never to become like them, But to view myself through their eyes.</sentence><sentence id="6493">To the Nazis, I was just a number, sub-human, a vermin.</sentence><sentence id="6494">But I am not a number.</sentence><sentence id="6495">My number is my badge of honor.</sentence><sentence id="6496">Let those responsible for the number feel ashamed, or whatever they want.lam a proud Jewish daughter.</sentence><sentence id="6497">To be born Jewish is neither a crime nor a disgrace, But to starve, torture and murder innocent people For being born Jewish is a crime against God and humanity.</sentence><sentence id="6498">A crime that has influenced the entire world.</sentence><sentence id="6499">Because whatever we choose to say and do We are becoming partners too.</sentence><sentence id="6500">But others are becoming the beneficiaries of our good deeds Or the victims of our evil deeds.</sentence><sentence id="6501">We each can make a difference.</sentence><sentence id="6502">One person can save many people And one person can destroy many people.</sentence><sentence id="6503"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mengelia</span> is responsible for the dead, over 400,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="6504">On the other hand, Wahlenberg and even Shindler is responsible for so many lives.</sentence><sentence id="6505">From the 1,100 Jews that Shindler saved, 6,000 descendents are now alive.</sentence><sentence id="6506">Can you imagine how many would be if the others had survived?Therefore, I feel that my first responsibility Is to God To live by the commandments</sentence><sentence id="6508">9 And not to transgress them Because I cannot do evil without becoming evil.</sentence><sentence id="6509">The lessons that my father taught me, whatever I do I become, if I lie I'm going to become a liar and I'll help him and others.</sentence><sentence id="6510">And I know one thing, we live in this world We are responsible for one another.</sentence><sentence id="6511">But not in a way to punish each other.</sentence><sentence id="6512">So whenever there is injustice and cruelty We need to be, to speak out, no matter where it is.</sentence><sentence id="6513">And to stand in solidarity with those who are repressed And not with the oppressor.</sentence><sentence id="6514">In the final analysis, without , all , religion and education fails.</sentence><sentence id="6515">So we need first to improve ourselves because then we make a better world.</sentence><sentence id="6516">If you wish I can share with you a few of the poems if there is still time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6623">Q: [have a question.</sentence><sentence id="6624">Because you do feel responsible, a sense of responsibility for your world . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6627">A: Our world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6629">Q: Right, but it's the same.</sentence><sentence id="6630">Are there certain events, historical events, in the last forty years or so that had a really strong impact on you other than, you've mentioned the birth of the Israeli State.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="6633">Are there other things that have effected you in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, like the Civil Rights Movement or wars or anything?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6634">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="6635">I feel, do you remember there was a who came and he wanted to, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, to speak in the movies about the Nazis?</sentence><sentence id="6636">We went and marched.</sentence><sentence id="6637">When there was, we went to speak.</sentence><sentence id="6638">Then there was suppose to be a rally here, Nazis wanted to march here.</sentence><sentence id="6639">We went to <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, I was among them, and we fought against it.</sentence><sentence id="6640">When I hear in private life, it doesn't only have to be in big things, in private life, when I was, when I hear that somebody is making a joke or on somebody else's expense, or an ethnic group, generalizations, I stand up and I speak up.</sentence><sentence id="6641">I said, "I don't appreciate what you said."</sentence><sentence id="6642">In fact, one of my dear friends who is non-Jewish, who I met through such occasion.</sentence><sentence id="6643">Because we were in the , it was a meeting and somebody said something negative about another group.</sentence><sentence id="6644">And I said, "I really don't appreciate because I know how it feels when people do that."</sentence><sentence id="6645">So in small thing.</sentence><sentence id="6646">You know, prejudice is very easy because you don't have to give accounts for it.</sentence><sentence id="6647">You just say it but you don't have to give, you know?</sentence><sentence id="6648">And the point is one thing, it's like fire.</sentence><sentence id="6649">When there is only one spark, you can erase it.</sentence><sentence id="6650">But if there is a big fire, you have no control any longer.</sentence><sentence id="6651">So in the little thing and the inter-relationship, in our daily life, in the personal, how we do people.</sentence><sentence id="6652">Because usually when a person from one group offends another, sometimes he starts hating or being angry towards the whole group.</sentence><sentence id="6653">So its important to respect each other.</sentence><sentence id="6654">It's important to speak up when there is a cause, when the Russian people worked, you know, when there was Iron Curtain, and we were fighting to release them, I was marching.</sentence><sentence id="6655">So when there is something, a special cause, if I know, if I see something injustice I write a letter, I speak up.</sentence><sentence id="6656">That's my contribution.</sentence><sentence id="6657">Those are the things which I do.</sentence><sentence id="6658">I cannot say, it doesn't bother because it effects.</sentence><sentence id="6659">You know, I just wanted to add, the Holocaust effected not just me, because the point is one thing, six million Jewish people and about 5 million non-Jewish people have lost.</sentence><sentence id="6660">They will never become what they had the potential of becoming.</sentence><sentence id="6661">The world will never know how many wonderful people we have lost.</sentence><sentence id="6662">Nor how many Nazi war criminals we have gained.</sentence><sentence id="6663">Because some of them still live in hiding .</sentence><sentence id="6664">So what did the world gain?Lose good people and gained criminals?</sentence><sentence id="6665">Whenever there is a crime we lose a good person, we gain</sentence><sentence id="6667">0 a criminal.</sentence><sentence id="6668">What trade-off is that?</sentence><sentence id="6669">So it's important.</sentence><sentence id="6670">Even to, in my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, to my own husband, I once told my husband, in sickness and in poverty and in riches and poor and everything, I will always stand by you .</sentence><sentence id="6671">But you commit a crime and I don't want to be any part of it.</sentence><sentence id="6672">Then you have to trade yourself in.</sentence><sentence id="6673">So there are certain loyalties.</sentence><sentence id="6674">In life we need to make choices.</sentence><sentence id="6675">We need to say to bring up decent children we have to learn to say no.</sentence><sentence id="6676">Because you know, in the commandments there is the ten commandments.</sentence><sentence id="6677">It says you shall, you shall not.</sentence><sentence id="6678">And another thing how you can put out, you cannot hatred with hatred, anger with anger.</sentence><sentence id="6679">Somebody once said in anger to me, I hate you.</sentence><sentence id="6680">Because I wouldn't give in to something that was not moral or ethical.</sentence><sentence id="6681">I said, it's okay I love you for both of us.</sentence><sentence id="6682">And the person apologized, she said, I really don't hate you it's just that I was angry with you, I couldn't, you are stubborn.</sentence><sentence id="6683">I said, what you call stubborn, that stubborn is what saved me from.</sentence><sentence id="6684">Because, in fact, I always felt what my family taught me.</sentence><sentence id="6685">That no power in the world can break my spirit as long as I don't collaborate with people in my own destruction.</sentence><sentence id="6686">Because what we do, this is what we become.</sentence><sentence id="6687">You kill you become a killer.</sentence><sentence id="6688">You cheat you become a cheat.</sentence><sentence id="6689">You save somebody so you, so the final analysis, it's not how much we know or how much we have, how much we care.</sentence><sentence id="6690">Caring is what life is all about.</sentence><sentence id="6691">And we have a wonderful group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> now, that was in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> last week.</sentence><sentence id="6692">They are called Champions of Caring.</sentence><sentence id="6693"><span class="BUILDING">High School</span> students.</sentence><sentence id="6694">And this is sponsored by the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6695">And by the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Relations Counsel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6696">And the , also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6697">And those kids, what do they do?</sentence><sentence id="6698">They go and help those who are less fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="6699">The sick, the elderly, the disabled.</sentence><sentence id="6700">This is what we need to do.</sentence><sentence id="6701">You know, the strongest message I can give, what I've learned, if we are not our brother's keeper, by omission we become our brother's killers.</sentence><sentence id="6702">Because there are sins by omission and sins by commission.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6785">Q: And when did you write these?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6787">A: This was written May 8, 1978.</sentence><sentence id="6788">A long time ago because the Holocaust, I've been living and breathing it, it's effected so deeply my life.</sentence><sentence id="6789">Just like a leaf tossed to the wind Separated from its branches and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> Not belonging anymore Liberated but not free Carrying the pain of separation Memories so painful and dear Memories of our world, it use to be A world that is no longer here I still see the Sabbath candles And my mother's gentle face My father is chanting the prayers My grandmother with her white shawl of lace I see my little sister and brother So young and so full of cheer Not yet understanding tragedies and hatred But sensing uncertainty and fear</sentence><sentence id="6791">1 The Nazi boots are marching My world with terror is filled The Holy Scriptures are burning Children are starved, tortured and killed The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> are closing us in What is there for us in store?My world is going slower and slower Nothing is like it was before.</sentence><sentence id="6792">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> are taking us on a journey For most it is the last ride My brothers and sisters are burning There is no more <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide Hitler's final solution is sealed We are trapped in a world of <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> Iam amazed that I have survived The horrors from the Holocaust to tell And there is another poem, which is called "I Am Not A Number", and I wrote it May 13, 1994.I was trapped in the killing center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> Surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, smoke and flame The Nazis tattooed a number on my arm 2-5-6-7-3 became my new name They tried to reduce me to a number Dehumanize me day by day But regardless of all their efforts The could not take my self worth away They murdered in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> my entire family In one single day All my earthly possessions were so brutally taken away They treated me worse than a hardened criminal Even though I did not commit any crime They hated me merely for being born Jewish And starved and tortured me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="6793">I was only 13 years old when they took away from me my right to life But they could not take away my will to live and to survive For nearly six nightmarish years I have endured a living <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> Nevertheless, I have outlived Hitler and the Third Reich And lived my story to tell The third one is my conversations with my late son, Michael.</sentence><sentence id="6794">When he asked me the first time about the number.</sentence><sentence id="6795">And this was written May 14, 1979.Who wrote on your arm, Mom?Asked curiously my little boy one day I looked sadly at my innocent child and thought Very carefully what to say</sentence><sentence id="6797">2 The Nazis tattooed this number on my arm I told my son short and plain Why did they do it, Mom?</sentence><sentence id="6798">He asked further My God, I thought, how can I explain?You see my child, there was a man Adolph Hitler was his name He was very cruel and hateful And inflicted on people suffering and pain Oh, said he, and ran out to play And I signed with great relief I wanted to protect him for as long as I could From knowing my deep sore and grief He grew and I could not protect him forever So I answered his questions one at a time He wanted to know why we Jews are hated Did we commit some kind of a crime?No, my child, I told my son, We have not committed any crime Yet we Jews have been victimized and slaughtered By 5 and Hitlers all the time Do you hate the Nazis for what they did to us?Now [ have no grandparents and relatives like my friends The Nazi murdered all our loved ones They have blood on their hands I know, my child, that you too are hurting But hatred and revenge can never restore The lives of those who perished in the Holocaust And the precious things we had once before You and I who know what pain is Must never inflict hurt and pain We must try to build a better world So the death of the victims shall not be in vain This is my message.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6818">Q: Did you talk much about your experiences with your sons?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6820">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="6821">But I spoke to them, I told them, but I spoke to them more about my experiences before the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="6822">I wanted them to know their grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="6823">Because I felt its important.</sentence><sentence id="6824">And as a result, my oldest son , a couple of years, two or three years ago and maybe a little longer, came here to visit.</sentence><sentence id="6825">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6826">And afterwards he calls me up and he said, "Ma, I had a very traumatic experience."</sentence><sentence id="6827">I said, "What's happened?"</sentence><sentence id="6828">He said, "I was waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I saw a man laying face down across the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6829">And I saw from nearby that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is coming.</sentence><sentence id="6830">I didn't know whether he was drunk, dead, sick, pushed, or wanted to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="6831">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="6832">And I was thinking, what should I do?</sentence><sentence id="6833">My mind was racing.</sentence><sentence id="6834">On the one hand, I risk my life because I didn't know if I'm going to be able, get time to get back.</sentence><sentence id="6835">And on the other hand, I thought, what would my grandmother do?</sentence><sentence id="6836">My grandmother -" Because I told him the story how my mother sacrificed herself and me.</sentence><sentence id="6837">And he said, "I jumped up and I saved him.</sentence><sentence id="6838">People</sentence><sentence id="6840">3 had to pull me up."</sentence><sentence id="6841">My first reaction was, how could you do something like this?</sentence><sentence id="6842">And then I said, " , when you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Yale University</span> I felt you achieved something special.</sentence><sentence id="6843">But this is something more special.</sentence><sentence id="6844">You proved that you are a and that is the highest religion, education and achievement.</sentence><sentence id="6845">I am very grateful."</sentence><sentence id="6846">Another thing, because everything effects, another thing is that when he was little and he was the oldest and he was not born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, had also to learn the language and go through the difficulty as a child.</sentence><sentence id="6847">I once told him, because he asked me also about my experience.</sentence><sentence id="6848">I said, " , both your parents are survivors of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="6849">We lost everything that was ours.</sentence><sentence id="6850">All that we have is our good name.</sentence><sentence id="6851">And if you will, I will always love you unconditionally, no matter what you will do because you are my child.</sentence><sentence id="6852">But just like I ought to feed you, I ought to feed you spiritually.</sentence><sentence id="6853">But there is one thing.</sentence><sentence id="6854">You do something morally and ethically wrong, you will not be allowed to have my name."</sentence><sentence id="6855">And I completely dismissed it from my mind.</sentence><sentence id="6856">When he was an adult already and I came to visit.</sentence><sentence id="6857">And all of a sudden, he starts telling me, "You know, Mom?</sentence><sentence id="6858">Whenever I was going to do something I asked myself, is this going to disgrace my parents?"</sentence><sentence id="6859">And thank God, my son grew up to be a very respectable, loving son, husband, father.</sentence><sentence id="6860">He has now a little girl, my grandchild, our grandchild.</sentence><sentence id="6861">She is named after my late son, second name.</sentence><sentence id="6862">Her name is Elizabeth Michaela.</sentence><sentence id="6863">We call her Eliza- la (ph).</sentence><sentence id="6864">And she was here shortly before I went on the March of the Living, April 14, 1996.</sentence><sentence id="6865">And for the first time, she noticed my number.</sentence><sentence id="6866">And she looks at me, she says, she was here Mother's Day.</sentence><sentence id="6867">During the time she learned a little more, she grew.</sentence><sentence id="6868">And she's playing, busy playing, and she takes a look on my arm and she says, "Barbie, A-B-C's."</sentence><sentence id="6869">Because she has a book with A-B-C's and she sensed that this is related.</sentence><sentence id="6870">She's only two years old.</sentence><sentence id="6871">So it's even effecting her.</sentence><sentence id="6872">For me, for my children, even for my grandchildren, it's too late.</sentence><sentence id="6873">They will never know the joy of having grandparents and Aunts and Uncle, they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="6874">But hopefully its not going to be too late for others.</sentence><sentence id="6875">And I want to finish with a very inspiring story.</sentence><sentence id="6876">Remember that I repeated many times that my grandmother's proverb, you only have what you give away.</sentence><sentence id="6877">In 1984, I received a letter from a person that I didn't even know.</sentence><sentence id="6878">Ida Jervis (ph), , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6879">And I opened the letter and I start reading it and it says, I'm your cousin.</sentence><sentence id="6880">I'm named after the same great- grandmother, .</sentence><sentence id="6881">I was four years old when my family left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I'm sure that you will appreciate this.</sentence><sentence id="6882">And I'm looking, she send me a photograph of my grandmother and her son.</sentence><sentence id="6883">And I thanked her.</sentence><sentence id="6884">She invited me to come and visit.</sentence><sentence id="6885">Really not knowing what to expect, a survivor, how I'm going to act?</sentence><sentence id="6886">Am I going to be reacting normal, am I being all broken up, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="6887">And I came and there was another relative who knew my mother because they were cousins and she left shortly before the war.</sentence><sentence id="6888">And she's telling me that every year for many years now, they have a family reunion, because this cousin was and she came with her sister and they
