<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Did your mother ever tell you who was in the group?</sentence><sentence id="211">Were there other children?</sentence><sentence id="212">Were you the only child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Well initially we -- when we left it was just our family unit.</sentence><sentence id="217">It was my mother's two brothers and their families, my aunt, who was a single woman.</sentence><sentence id="218">My Aunt Rachel was single, and my --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So you were not part of a partisan group or anything?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Not initially.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Not initially.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: But eventually what happened was we were in --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Let's talk about initially first.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Well initially -- the first night I can tell you my mother claims th -- because she -- they ran away, she said she didn't even have time to take wa -- it was already tow -- it's towards fall, I believe, getting close to winter and she didn't take any clothing for me.</sentence><sentence id="230">So come nighttime, you know, I was crying and you know, and she was ready to go back and she started to go back and she met a peasant along the way who said, where you going?</sentence><sentence id="231">And she said, we're going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nisregin</span>, he said, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>'s been burnt down.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Are we talking about fall of "41?</sentence><sentence id="236">Is that what you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Probably, is my hunch.</sentence><sentence id="238">But I -- you know, I -- I --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I'm not keen on the dates.</sentence><sentence id="242">In any case, when we -- when we ran -- so she turned back and we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, you know, and we continued in our wanderings, so we'd meet up with other groups, and what happened was that people find each other.</sentence><sentence id="243">So there was other stragglers, other civilians, Jews, but in our peregrinations we also wound up meeting with partisan groups eventually, sometimes hostile and sometimes friendly.</sentence><sentence id="244">Sometimes -- we didn't have Jewish partisan groups like you -- you had sometimes further north in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, per se, but we met up with a number of different non-Jewish partisan groups.</sentence><sentence id="245">And they weren't all friendly.</sentence><sentence id="246">And -- but I do begin to remember -- you know, it's hard to distinguish sometimes what you've dreamed and what stories you've integrated from other people.</sentence><sentence id="247">I do begin to remember the lib -- the</sentence><sentence id="249">liberation, when the Russians came in and -- and -- and thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="250">I was very sick in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and this I was told by my mother.</sentence><sentence id="251">I developed -- because I was an infant, I was what, less than two years old when the war -- and I developed diphtheria and I was close to death, I mean, I -- s - - you know, so my mother took me to a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span>, miles away, where the Russians treated -- th-the partisans and the military had a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> and she wanted them to treat me and -- and the officer in charge says look at all the people, we have soldiers in there and I don't have time for -- for you.</sentence><sentence id="252">So she took me back and -- to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">encampment</span> and through some -- I forget what she told me, they -- in e -- in essence they gave me what would today be considered a vaporizer treatment and it seemed to work, some remedy that they found, and I survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Are there any other -- I hate to used the word anecdotes, but stories that your mother told you about that time, before you remembered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Y-Yeah, I mean, she would tell me about what it was like to go and search for food, for example, and how dangerous that was.</sentence><sentence id="270">And some of the people, because you would -- you would have to leave -- you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was both safety, but it was also deprivation.</sentence><sentence id="272">Safety in the sense that organized armies don't go into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">Not out of fear, but you know, it's -- you -- you just don't.</sentence><sentence id="274">I mean, you don't bring in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and armor and what have you into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">So you -- you -- so people can hide in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">On the other hand, you're deprived of food and y-you know, we weren't hunters, you know what I mean, it's not like -- yeah, I mean people ate -- you know, they ate berries or they ate mushrooms of they f -- whatever they found.</sentence><sentence id="277">But they would also go out, leave the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and go to some peasants that they knew or some farmer, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were still in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we wa -- we had not yet wandered far enough into it, so you were able to leave and go and get some food.</sentence><sentence id="278">But of course that</sentence><sentence id="280">presupposed that the -- th-the peasant you were going to was not going to sell you out and was not going to inform the Germans that you were there.</sentence><sentence id="281">So it was fraught with danger and of course some of the people that they knew, other Jews, were killed on these missions.</sentence><sentence id="282">So she would tell me about these things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: How would you describe your mother?</sentence><sentence id="300">She sounds like a very strong woman to have gone through this, and kept you alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: She was -- I do [indecipherable] describe her, an-and the way I have described her is she was great in a crisis, but she was not so great in dealing with normal day to day life.</sentence><sentence id="304">And I really mean that.</sentence><sentence id="305">And there are certain people who, when they face a crisis can galvanize and mobilize all their -- you know, their -- their resources, psychological, physical etcetera and move into gear.</sentence><sentence id="306">And there are others who are paralyzed by it.</sentence><sentence id="307">And she was able to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: Well, here she was a young woman in her 20's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: She was a young --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: -- with a baby.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: That's right, a young woman with a baby.</sentence><sentence id="318">And it's something that -- it wasn't until I was much older that I was able to appreciate what it took.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: All right, now let's move up to your [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: -- and what -- what you said your first memory in [indecipherable] before --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: My first memory was actually being liberated.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Well, describe that, what your memory --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Oh, there's another anecdote, you asked for anecdotal information.</sentence><sentence id="327">I actually had my first</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="334">0 taste of alcohol when I was a child in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, because one of the groups, the -- this again my mother told me, not that I remember it, one of the partisan groups we met up with -- and -- and the relation with the partisan group, even if they were unfriendly, they were like protectors, you know, so you wanted -- civilians wanted to be near partisans.</sentence><sentence id="335">On the other hand, you were also -- sometimes feared them.</sentence><sentence id="336">This group was not well disposed to Jews apparently, but they took a liking to me because I was a cute -- according to my mother, a cute child.</sentence><sentence id="337">So they took me -- they would take me away.</sentence><sentence id="338">They would ad -- literally take me away from her and take me to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> and there taught me how to drink booze.</sentence><sentence id="339">So -- but my own memory that I can, you know, say this, I remember this, was actually riding out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> on an ox drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> heaped with whatever belongings people had.</sentence><sentence id="340">So when you see those films of refugees, you know, and in that's -- you know, I remember sitting on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and being afraid I'd fall down.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Did you have any idea, being a toddler at the time, what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="349">Was it something good, was it something scary?</sentence><sentence id="350">You know, do you remember being scared or do you remember being excited?</sentence></p></dialogue>
