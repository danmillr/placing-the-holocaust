<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Well, excuse me, you could see the chaos that started by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> that started to b- bombard the vicinity where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> itself slowed down.</sentence><sentence id="42">And it was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> and the troops liquidated their post, from the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> and it was sort of a chance to take, now or never.</sentence><sentence id="43">So that what we took and thank God, we were successful.</sentence><sentence id="44">And we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> there, where -- where we were confronted by some French prisoner of wars, who helped us by changing our prison uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="45">And then we were -- we hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and -- until we met the American troops, so, two or three d -- two or three days later, until the fighting finally stopped, and we sa -- went out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> onto the open <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we were stopped by a American patrol, who took us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> and then we were interrogated, and set free.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="49">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 4</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: You were set free, do you remember how you felt when they approached you?</sentence><sentence id="51">Were you afraid, did you -- did they know who you were?</sentence><sentence id="52">You weren't wearing prison uniforms, you said, you had regular clothes on?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: No, no, no, no, we're -- oh, you -- no, I'm sorry, when we -- when we met them, we were in civil uniforms, that's correct, but we were recognized by the hat -- that we had no hair on -- it was shaved in a certain way that the prisoners were, by a -- sort of a center of the head, the <span class="DLF">street</span>, that was left a little bald down to the skin and next to it, there were a little bit of hair, so it was recognizable as a <span class="DLF">street</span> or a mark to be a prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="54">And we had a hard time to the convince the -- the people, the soldiers that we are Jews, because they were -- believed that the -- all the Jews were killed.</sentence><sentence id="55">And we choder -- we showed them our numbers on the arm and then they still didn't believe it, and they ask us when the Jewish holidays are, which we knew and answered them and then they finally said yes, you know, and t-took us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and drove us to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, where we met the colonel, who instead -- interrogated us about the German troop movements and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> itself, the location and the -- whatever we knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we told them, which wasn't very much, because within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we had no knowledge what was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">So we couldn't be, in that respect, any great help.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Hm.</sentence><sentence id="62">How long were you questioned for?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Oh, I would say about a half an hour.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: And where was this?</sentence><sentence id="82">Where were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: To be honest about it, I -- I don't -- I -- I -- on the map I could locate it, but I don't remember the name, whether it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shwabingin</span> or whether it was nearby [indecipherable] where -- that wa -- it was -- it was not very far out from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, but I would say about a hundred miles or so and that's -- that's where we were and that's where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> also is, close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="88">And you were how old, and your brother, about, was how old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: I was -- Well, it was 1945, I was 20 years old and my brother was 23.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="94">Now, somehow -- How did you end up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and tell me about what that was like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: How?</sentence><sentence id="98">I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: How did you get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and -- and what was that --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="107">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Well, we -- you know, it's a funny thing nowadays, in 1999, I would say, things are more electronically and -- equipped.</sentence><sentence id="109">Those days it was word to mouth and it worked very good, I must say, because people were constantly on the move.</sentence><sentence id="110">Everybody was looking for somebody and traveling and moving and meeting.</sentence><sentence id="111">And everybody had the story to tell, and that's how we found out from people that we met, who told us about that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we pursued to find out who, if any of th -- our friends or acquaintances from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were in the -- in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">I was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> per se, in the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span>, that we were transported in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: So it sounds like, for a period there, before you went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>, you and your brother were sort of on your own?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: That's right, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="121">We were isolated from any news and from any friends or people of Jewish contact, and that's why my brother traveled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, to see what is going on there and o -- upon his return, we waited a week or so and then we decided that it would be better for us to be where the Jewish population is, despite the fact that we could have had a very substantial <span class="BUILDING">German factory</span> and property from the Nazi that was -- evacuated the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which we occupied after his leaving.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Well, tell me about that.</sentence><sentence id="125">Wa -- This was after you'd been interrogated?</sentence><sentence id="126">How did you end up where you did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Well, after we left the -- after we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> -- not the D -- the interrogation, see, and we were told -- we told the commander that we would like to be on our own, and</sentence><sentence id="132">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 7 not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span>, he instructed the lieutenant to take care of us and to give us some accommodation.</sentence><sentence id="133">And he took us into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and comma-commanded to meet the mayor from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">And he met the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in a short while and he instructed the mayor, without any doubt, that he has three Jewish survivors and they are not going to sleep on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and to provide us with a comfortable <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and food and all that.</sentence><sentence id="135">And as -- they gave an -- an -- an hour's time.</sentence><sentence id="136">And we waited an hour and then he came back and he said that he found a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for us which -- and he's going to take us there and give us a woman to care for us and provide us with anything that we want and need, which actually took place.</sentence><sentence id="137">After we took the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we looked around, there were three <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and we took all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, pillows and all that into one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and for the first time in our life, we slept comfortable and warm, and it was the first time that we really slept in -- un-undescribable.</sentence><sentence id="138">Now, this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became the meeting point for the Jewish soldiers that were in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">There was also a detachment from the Israeli army there, as prisoner of war, who served as the English army.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I would say that it was -- it was a comfortable time that we spent there with these people who had an opportunity to meet us and they brought us army rations and it was quite remarkable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: That is remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="155">I mean, this was very soon after --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Days -- Days after, days after.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Did you trust?</sentence><sentence id="166">I mean, you were still among German people at this point.</sentence><sentence id="167">Did you trust them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, to be honest about it, I trusted them as far as ca -- I can throw them, which isn't very far, but a -- I -- I -- Is -- I sort of felt I had the upper hand at this particular time, because I knew that the American had everything un -- occupied and I -- I felt that there was very little that they could do, in order to do anything physically, or any other which way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Did you -- Did you witness any treatment of how the POW's were being treated by the al --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: No, no, it was -- it was afte-after the war, there were na -- no German soldier's occupation visible.</sentence><sentence id="175">The American were in hundred percent control and all you can see is what -- what I knew were -- how -- how a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> looked like, it didn't look like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but it looked like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you know, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or the other, there's no -- not much -- any big difference.</sentence><sentence id="176">The only thing different was that they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, which we didn't have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and they were treated different</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="182">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0032 9 than we were, and there was -- there was a difference in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in the treatment and the accommodations that they had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> than I had in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: Did you see any collaborators or perpetrators being tracked down -- rounded up, anything like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: No, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="189">I didn't see anything of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="190">Although, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, the -- there were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish kapos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">That means Jewish people who obtained preference of ser -- supervising the Jewish working force and -- and used their force by beating Jewish people as well as the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="192">And if they came and were recognized, they suffered the consequences.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: What do you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Well, you know, if somebody came in there and the -- the -- and somebody recognized them, and people suffered under the -- under their treatment, they had now an opportunity to get even with them.</sentence><sentence id="201">So, to what extent I cannot describe, because sometimes they were brutal and sometimes they were not as brutal.</sentence><sentence id="202">So it -- it all depended upon the -- the force.</sentence><sentence id="203">It could have been two people, it could have been 10 people who -- who were together and suffered, you know, and they got even with them.</sentence><sentence id="204">But it was, in my opinion, the -- in my o -- in my opinion, legitimate and it was r-right to -- for the revenge.</sentence><sentence id="205">So, it didn't happen very often, so, you know, it is -- it is a matter of -- that the card -- the card have turned.</sentence><sentence id="206">You know, it is a -- a fact that the people never thought that they going to face the -- the facts, and the day of judgment came.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="209"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0032 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, you said?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: Well, the -- I -- [remember two or three of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="219">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, it was a -- a point, you know, a meeting point and that was the <span class="BUILDING">Munich museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">And th-the Jewish people met there, because it was a very large place where you could congregate.</sentence><sentence id="221">It was not within the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>, it was out of the -- out of sight and that's where people met and it was known all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="222">So even people from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, or whatever, you know, they heard about and that's -- if they looked for somebody, that's where they went to see and meet people.</sentence><sentence id="223">And that's where -- where these things happened, you know, and it didn't take much, because there were a lot of people there, to create the -- the -- you know, tumult.</sentence><sentence id="224">And that's -- that's where it happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Go ahead, sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Now, it -- it also happened at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish office</span> in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, where people met to register for certain purposes, and there was also a meeting point there, so it also happened there, but not very often.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: It happened more at the Jewish mu -- at the -- not Jewish, but at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">So, it was a very knowledgeable point and it was very well done, I must say.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="242"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0032 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: What -- What would happen when they were recognized?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, they were physically attacked and beaten and that's all.</sentence><sentence id="245">They were not shot or killed or some like that.</sentence><sentence id="246">But they were beaten up.</sentence><sentence id="247">They got their -- their point -- their -- their point across in that -- that respect.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: D-Do you remember hearing of them say anything in -- to justify or defend themselves, to how they'd behaved?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Well, naturally they -- they -- everybody who gets attacked or something like this, always says something to defend themselve, but the -- the main issue was that they said, you know, "We were just prisoners like you and somebody had to do it, and we were selected, so we had to do it."</sentence><sentence id="255">But, you know, there's a difference, like the same thing with the Germans, that you can do something, and you can do it two ways.</sentence><sentence id="256">You can do it just to do it or you can put some personal hatred and force behind it and make it worse than it could be.</sentence><sentence id="257">And that is the issue and that's what they did, because the same thing the Germans, I mean, they we -- they were soldiers, but they were soldiers to defend themselves, but to go and put the personal atro-atrocity in the -- in -- in the -- in the movements, in the facts, that what killed so many people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
