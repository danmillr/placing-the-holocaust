week.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3">SB: What about before the Germans came, the pogroms that took place, did you see any of them.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: No, I didn't see any pogroms but I don't even recall hearing about them before the German occupation.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6">I think all that happened after the German occupation.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="7">SB: Tell me about it, tell me what you know about it.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Mostly rumors.</sentence><sentence id="10">Well I do remember that the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we were living in and we only had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we were renting at the time, in the a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> that was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jalya kolnis</span>, meaning the Green Mountain.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="11">And it was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">There were two young students living in the <span

TIMECODE NOTES: in the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> acquaintance with them.</sentence><sentence id="17">And they told me the day before the occupation that they had planned on escaping with the Russians who were in retreat.</sentence><sentence id="18">And so there was, actually it was a very, very, it was a panic stricken Jewish population trying to decide whether it was better to run or to stay.</sentence><sentence id="19">And during this mad rush to get out, with the Russians, I think at that point already the Lithuanian partisans went into actions and fell upon some innocent victims who were trying to escape.</sentence><sentence id="20">But I think the real partisan mass murders came after the Russians had finally retreated.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="21">And life resumed some normalcy for those who had stayed behind.</sentence><sentence id="22">But not for long.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="23">SB: What do you mean by not for long.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Well at that point rumors, before the, before there even was talk of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we heard about people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who had been abducted from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, by willing Lithuanian so called partisans who also ran- sacked the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">Who would round up mostly men and either taunt and torture them or, or shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="27">I didn't see any of this though with my own eyes because I have no idea whether the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> that we lived in was more protected than the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">But no, I have no knowledge of seeing with my own eyes the, the brutal acts of the Lithuanian partisans.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="29">SB: But you heard about it at the time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="30">BAv Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="31">Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence

racial laws against the Jews were put into effect.</sentence><sentence id="38">The racial laws that, the Nuremberg laws that had already been implemented in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and other <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">And I can be more specific.</sentence><sentence id="40">And, and mention that none of the Jewish academicians or professionals were allowed to go about their work.</sentence><sentence id="41">The doctors were not allowed to practice medicine unless they were seeing Jewish patients.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="42">Lawyers were, were dismissed from their <span class="BUILDING">firms</span> and professors were dismissed from the, from their academic positions.</sentence><sentence id="43">And the curfew

Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="47">outer clothing, on the left hand side of the chest as well as on the back.</sentence><sentence id="48">It had to be firmly sewn on versus being pinned on which could always indicate the inten- tion to escape or blend with the general population.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="49">Also Jews were made to walk int eh <span class="DLF">street</span> or in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">They were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and all the men had to take off their hats or caps when crossing the

hats.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Well I don't think I have I can add anything to that.</sentence><sentence id="55">Those were the first blows to our civil liber- ties.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="56">SB: Tell me about the formation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And do you remember moving in.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes, I do.</sentence><sentence id="60">A decree went out that all Jews in the</sentence><sentence id="62">Video

id="67">The three of us were at a disadvantage because we had nothing to trade.</sentence><sentence id="68">So we depended on the kindness of strangers to give us a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And after a long search, my father was able to find a pharmacist, an elderly pharmacist, friend of my mother's who had owned a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in my mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, where she had grown up.</sentence><sentence id="70">So Mr. Mesahovich and his wife told my father that they had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">attic space</span> that they could spare, that everything else had already been spoken for.</sentence><sentence id="71">And that the three of us could have this <span class="INT_SPACE">attic space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">So that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="73">We, we had very few Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="74">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="75">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="77">two.</sentence><sentence id="78">And the clothes that we had been able to save from our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">Then my dad hired a, um well he found a peasant with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and he paid him for this, for the transportation of our worldly goods.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="80">To the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="81">SB: What was the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> like, how big was it.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Very small.</sentence><sentence id="84">I am very bad at dimensions but it was a long narrow <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> that, that held my parents" <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, on the one long <span class="DLF">wall</span> and my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> opposite my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> next to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="86">I could look out.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I saw many brutal and memorable unforgettable scenes from that <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">And just a very primitive <span class="DLF">door</span> that led from one <span class="INT_SPACE">attic space</span> to our smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">attic space</span> because on the other side of the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, another family um was living.</sentence><sentence id="89">And that family consisted of four people--a mother, father, adult daughter who was a medical student and her young broth- er who was maybe 12 years old at the time.</sentence><sentence id="90">These people became our very good and trusted friends and I would like to mention that the older son Ted Pace is going to be interviewed tomorrow and I hope to have a chance to meet up with him after 50 years.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="92">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="93">Sound Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="94">KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT

it may have been August or maybe early September.</sentence><sentence id="106">And because the work condi- tions seemed so wonderful by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> standards because already food was scarce and men had been taken away for forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="107">I'm not even sure what it was, it sound- ed like a wonderful opportunity to be situated ina safe office environment, perhaps even get a meal or two during the day.</sentence><sentence id="108">And then return at night.</sentence><sentence id="109">Because I wasn't working at the time

class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">It was near the what we called the big <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, at least that's how I remember it.</sentence><sentence id="116">And

must have barged into <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and dragged some able bodied young Jewish men out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and added them to the, the rest of the group.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">SB: And so you had a bad feeling when they left and then how did you figure out what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Um, I was still optimistic when they left.</sentence><sentence id="137">And when tho truth finally came out it was just total disbelief.</sentence><sentence id="138">Such deception.</sentence><sentence id="139">Yeah, when the, when I found out that they had been killed.</sentence><sentence id="140">I think they were killed at the, at one of the <span

the..</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Well the news just spread like wildfire through- out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">Neighbors huddled together and counted the losses.</sentence><sentence id="146">Many of our family friends were in that group.</sentence><sentence id="147">The best the best minds were taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">The best minds who might have been able to provide leadership.</sentence><sentence id="149">They were, there were no longer there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="150">SB: And then not long after that, near the end of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="153">October was the big action.</sentence><sentence id="154">Can you tell me how that happened.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="155">Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="156">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="157">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="159">close to the square.</sentence><sentence id="160">So it we had a very short dis- tance to walk.</sentence><sentence id="161">We may have had a five or ten minute walk at the most.</sentence><sentence id="162">And we had planned to leave our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> around 5:30.</sentence><sentence id="163">Well around 4:00 on that morning, I could hear footsteps, never ending footsteps.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was still, there was still total darkness.</sentence><sentence id="165">It was a cold uh damp foggy uh kind of late fall early winter day.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="166">There may have been some snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, there may have been some wet snow falling.</sentence><sentence id="167">And the three of us my mother, father and i started getting ready for our trip down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and out the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">But before we did that I dabbed some lipstick on my mother's cheeks to make her look a little more healthy.</sentence><sentence id="169">We dressed warmly and just started out toward the square.</sentence><sentence id="170">My father was supporting my mother on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, I was supporting her Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="171">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="172">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="174">made it to the square.</sentence><sentence id="175">At the square there was, there was total chaos.</sentence><sentence id="176">Um, family units didn't know where to stand.</sentence><sentence id="177">Everybody of course at that point already had a work pass and was affiliated with a work group.</sentence><sentence id="178">And my father was, as head of, as head of the family we joined his work outfit.</sentence><sentence id="179">And he was working at the <span class="BUILDING">military airport</span> doing just manual labor, construction work, digging, hauling rocks, that sort of, of thing.</sentence><sentence id="180">So we looked for the larger contingent of <span class="DLF">air</span>, air field workers and we stood with them.</sentence><sentence id="181">And stood and waited.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="182">As we were waiting um and at that point I think there were about 28,000 Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so all of them or most of them were assembled on the square.</sentence><sentence id="183">And um so we noticed that several German officers, I don't know what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> they belonged to, whether they were SS or some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">I suspect they were members of the SS and one of them was greatly feared.</sentence><sentence id="185">His name was Rauca, R-A-U-C-A. And he was, I had never seen him before but he was pointed out to me and I think he was standing behind some sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and there may have been a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">There were some papers on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he was not alone, there were other Germans with him.</sentence><sentence id="187">I don't know whether there were dogs or not.</sentence><sentence id="188">I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="189">But they all had their pistols in their holster and possibly whips.</sentence><sentence id="190">Well as soon as a family unit had found their work groups, there was a little more order in the square.</sentence><sentence id="191">And I remember that we were still standing around noon.</sentence><sentence id="192">Nothing had, nobody had</sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="196">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="197">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="199">(second side of cassette) (BS--<span class="BUILDING">Wentworth Films</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span>, interview continued with Brigitte Altman, sound roll 8, camera roll 15 at the head, 5-5-97) (speed) (mark, 15 marker) Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="200">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="201">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="203">that was unfolding, families that were torn apart, were perhaps elderly parents were separated from their younger adult children.</sentence><sentence id="204">Or sometimes the even mothers with children were separated from their husbands.</sentence><sentence id="205">And the crying and despair was, it was just devastating.</sentence><sentence id="206">Of course our worry was how to get by, get past the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">in- spection table</span>, how would we get my mother through.</sentence><sentence id="207">I don't know if it was the hand of God but we passed uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and Rauca must have perhaps was looking the other way.</sentence><sentence id="208">I know at one time he was eating his sandwich for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="209">And calmly eating his sandwich holding it in one hand and with the other hand direct- ing people to, to life or to death.</sentence><sentence id="210">And it may have been that during one of those moments while he was not looking the three of us were able to slip past the <span class="BUILDING">reviewing stand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">And once we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, we were so relieved.</sentence><sentence id="212">We knew it wasn't over yet but at least we had reached a safety point, a safe haven.</sentence><sentence id="213">For whatever period would be allotted to us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="214">SB: And how did you find out what happened to the people going to the <span class="NPIP">bad side</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="215">Video Tape No.</sentence><sentence id="216">Camera Roll No.</sentence><sentence id="217">Sound Roll No.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">KOVNO GHETTO EXHIBIT Interview w/BRIGITTE ALTMAN page 15 Interviewed (5-5-97) by Sandra W.
