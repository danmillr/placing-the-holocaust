class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2811">The only difference is, picture a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> to either side with <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2812">And he has the whole back end of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, the director, right?</sentence><sentence id="2813">He lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, as it would be, or on <span class="BUILDING">campus</span>, what -- however you want to put it.</sentence><sentence id="2814">He had a beautiful

what you would call a <span class="INT_SPACE">reception room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2816">The <span class="INT_SPACE">reception room</span> had a little <span class="DLF">window</span>, people ask questions, then the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and then part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">reception room</span> was partitioned off about -- I'd say about three

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jobs</span> and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="2827">But it paid off in the end, I tell you, big time.</sentence><sentence id="2828">So the most amazing thing is that -- of course there was no gasoline to be had in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, so the French invented <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that -- the regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were converted to run on charcoal gas.</sentence><sentence id="2829">They had those big cylinders mounted in the back of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and you threw charcoal in there and you lit it and that created gas and that went through a tubing to some sort of fuel indi -- gas injector.</sentence><sentence id="2830">And you weren't ri -- winning any races with it, but you could at least do 25 miles an hour with that, flat of course, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2831">So th-the -- th-the Germans were even smarter than that, they invent -- they were so -- so brilliant,

class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2834">And then they had bags of chopped green wood, mind you.</sentence><sentence id="2835">You took a bag of green wood, threw it in that cylinder, that transform it into charcoal, send it over to that cylinder, and that's how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> worked.</sentence><sentence id="2836">I mean, you -- you gotta give them credit.</sentence><sentence id="2837">You don't have to like them, but you gotta give them credit.</sentence></p></dialogue>

lengths, you know, stack the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>, cords of wood, and split it.</sentence><sentence id="4307">| mean, can you imagine splitting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that big around?</sentence><sentence id="4308">Oh, such fun.</sentence><sentence id="4309">And then at night they took us back.</sentence><sentence id="4310">The reward was, we ate in the noncommissioned officer's mess, and we wore civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="4311">And that saved our life, because after a little while, the Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pau</span>, in the commandanture must have heard that there's some Jews around there someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4312">Will never do.</sentence><sentence id="4313">So one night we're eating in the mess, and all of a sudden I see a pair of my favorite black suited militia come in.</sentence><sentence id="4314">French.</sentence><sentence id="4315">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="4316">Get nervous already.</sentence><sentence id="4317">Then I see another pair coming in.</sentence><sentence id="4318">And another pair.</sentence><sentence id="4319">So I said to the guys, we're all eating at the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, I says, look fellows, let's not make it obvious.</sentence><sentence id="4320">Let's just go out here one or two at a time like we're finished eating.</sentence><sentence id="4321">We weren't finished eating but that was no time to stick around, right?</sentence><sentence id="4322">So we got out and [indecipherable] out and we saw -- see, there's the main <span class="DLF">route</span>, what they call route nationale was running alongside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4323">I told you, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="4326">9 was like a mile long.</sentence><sentence id="4327">Would you believe they had truckloads of these militia men that surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> every 50 or a hundred feet, so that nobody could escape?</sentence><sentence id="4328">So, what to do, you know?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4329">The guy's already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but I happened to be very good friends with one of the -- it was one of the older police inspectors in his -- must have been 40's or some like that.</sentence><sentence id="4330">And he was married and he was still living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Quonset huts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4331">Very civilized though, and he had two kids.</sentence><sentence id="4332">So I have one guy with me also, big guy, but he was a real baby.</sentence><sentence id="4333">He says, what are you gonna do, what are you g -- I says, what, I'm going to try to sneak through the <span class="DLF">wire</span> and run across to in -- it was night, and see whether this inspector would put me up overnight until they have left and done their dirty deed, right?</sentence><sentence id="4334">He's like, please take me along, take me along.</sentence><sentence id="4335">I says, hey man, what are you crazy, nobody knows you.</sentence><sentence id="4336">Well, he made such a pest of mys -- of himself, I took him along.</sentence><sentence id="4337">So -- you -- you remember, it was the war, so there's blackout, there's no lights anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="4338">Knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and either he or his wife open up the <span class="DLF">door</span>, I says, blah, blah, blah --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4339">Q:

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4347">Q: All right, so you're now in the process of escaping with this other guy, and you've knocked on the <span class="DLF">commandant's door</span> and the wife answered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4349">A: No, not the commandant, one of the inspectors.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4351">Q: Oh, I mean one -- one of the inspectors, I'm sorry, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4353">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4354">And I says -- explained my situation whether we could come in and you know, I have a problem.</sentence><sentence id="4355">Oh, she pulls us in, and explained to them.</sentence><sentence id="4356">Oh, she says, sure.</sentence><sentence id="4357">Now you gotta understand how good the French are.</sentence><sentence id="4358">I listen to them being torn apart all the time, and I don't listen to this.</sentence><sentence id="4359">She had two children.</sentence><sentence id="4360">First thing she did, she took the kids out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, where did she put them to sleep, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4361">Then, I haven't slept in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in how long, I don't know how long.</sentence><sentence id="4362">She goes ahead and changes the sheet.</sentence><sentence id="4363">I said, lady, you don't have to change the sheet.</sentence><sentence id="4364">She changed the sheet.</sentence><sentence id="4365">Now, you know why I say that.</sentence><sentence id="4366">You couldn't get soap in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, or stuff you use to do a wash.</sentence><sentence id="4367">I mean a -- I'm telling you, it -- it -- it was a horror show.</sentence><sentence id="4368">So she insisted on giving us fresh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4369">So we spent the night there, we slept together in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, of course, and then the following morning we went back and we saw how much damage the German did.</sentence><sentence id="4370">Couple of guys managed to get lucky, but they got a few, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4371">And then that was a signal for me that it's getting towards the end, you can not hang out here any more.</sentence><sentence id="4372">So I took a gamble.</sentence><sentence id="4373">I was -- I told you, when I was the orderly there at this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the recepti -- <span class="INT_SPACE">reception room</span>, and next to me was the radio operator, you know, in touch with who knows what.</sentence><sentence id="4374">So his name was Otis.</sentence><sentence id="4375">So I go and see him, I says, Otis, gotta ask you something.</sentence><sentence id="4376">Do you by any chance know anybody on the underground that's a guy that takes people over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4377">Took a gamble.</sentence><sentence id="4378">Could have handed me over to the police, too, right, or the Germans?</sentence><sentence id="4379">Says, let me see, come back in a little while.</sentence><sentence id="4380">He set up an appointment with me -- for me with some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> type</sentence><sentence id="4382">1 guy, and we met, supposedly some sort of <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, I -- I could get out, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4383">I me -- I worked for the assistant and he -- he had the <span class="DLF">gate</span> right behind his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so I knew how to get out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> without getting through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4384">So I met him, and meanwhile it became known for some reason that I was gonna get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4385">And the next think I know, I got four guys bugging the bejeebers out of me to take them with m -- with me, along.</sentence><sentence id="4386">There was only one drawback.</sentence><sentence id="4387">After I saw the guide, he says it's -- argument-wise, 5,000 whatever it is per person.</sentence><sentence id="4388">I says okay.</sentence><sentence id="4389">I had -- I always had some money, I worked.</sentence><sentence id="4390">Even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when I was the orderly I made money, fine.</sentence><sentence id="4391">Always had money.</sentence><sentence id="4392">But the other dudes didn't have any money.</sentence><sentence id="4393">So what are we gonna do?</sentence><sentence id="4394">I have to rustle up a fortune of money.</sentence><sentence id="4395">So in the middle of the night we used to sneak out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sell everything we could get rid of, we didn't need.</sentence><sentence id="4396">So eventually -- and then I went to some guy I know who had a lot of money, and I says, look, blah, blah, blah, I'm shy so much money, how about it?</sentence><sentence id="4397">So he gave it to me.</sentence><sentence id="4398">So finally I have got all the money and when we went out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at night, was the winter anyway, it was January the 21deg, 1944 -- so I gave him the money and the money wasn't for him.</sentence><sentence id="4399">He -- during the day they had to hide us in a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and the farmer had to feed us.</sentence><sentence id="4400">In order to buy food they needed money, that's what the money was for.</sentence><sentence id="4401">And you know the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> fooled me a lot.</sentence><sentence id="4402">I had no idea, I'm telling you, I'm naive in every re-respect.</sentence><sentence id="4403">Only once though, you don't do it twice with me.</sentence><sentence id="4404">But the first time around, anything goes.</sentence><sentence id="4405">I saw the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, I says, oh, you climb that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, no big deal.</sentence><sentence id="4406">Imagine my disappointment when we get on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, what's across the s -- from me as far as I can see, another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, just as high.</sentence><sentence id="4407">Well, there were six of them.</sentence><sentence id="4408">Ill make it short because w-we don't have a week.</sentence><sentence id="4409">The last week -- the last day, we hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">glacier</span>, we were that high up already, you know, past the <span class="DLF">snow line</span>, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">glacier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4410">Now, we weren't exactly dressed.</sentence><sentence id="4411">Remember this is between January 21deg, and January 27%</sentence><sentence id="4413">2 alright?</sentence><sentence id="4414">And in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> that's not exactly summertime weather.</sentence><sentence id="4415">And especially without the proper equipment.</sentence><sentence id="4416">So we hitting this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">glacier</span> -- oh, by the way, those guides were all volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="4417">They walked the whole night, and then they c -- they -- they could walk much better than us, then the following -- well, the following morning, they ran back to the -- their day job.</sentence><sentence id="4418">Some of them were e-engineers on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4419">Some did ta -- they -- th-they did that -- they didn't get any sleep for 24 hours.</sentence><sentence id="4420">They did that without a nickel of remuneration.</sentence><sentence id="4421">The money was strictly for the farmers so they could buy food for us.</sentence><sentence id="4422">Logical situation, which we didn't know but we found out.</sentence><sentence id="4423">So we climbed during the night.</sentence><sentence id="4424">The reason that it took so long -- there's a perfectly good <span class="DLF">road</span> that goes along in the valley, the only trouble is that it's patrolled by Germans, because that's the <span class="DLF">road</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4425">So we went over every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> without any <span class="DLF">roads</span> whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="4426">Was horror show.</sentence><sentence id="4427">I once fell down the side of a <span class="DLF">mountain cliff</span> just like that.</sentence><sentence id="4428">And it's just like in the movies, th-the only thing that stopped me between <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> and <span class="NPIP">earth</span>, there was this shrub sticking out from that <span class="DLF">cliff</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4429">And I get ahold of it.</sentence><sentence id="4430">So now I'm looking up and I see the guys on top and I look down <span class="NPIP">below</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4431">And the guides came, he was like s -- more of a mountaineer, right?</sentence><sentence id="4432">You see, there was -- the pass was that wide, there was no light.</sentence><sentence id="4433">And it had eroded, there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> like that and I didn't see, and I stepped right in that <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4434">The way we could see is -- you know what a musette is?</sentence><sentence id="4435">That's like a bread bag that they have in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for the soldiers or for anything, a -- a bag, and they're usually in light canvas.</sentence><sentence id="4436">So, was flung over the back from the guy, so that's what you were focusing on because him you couldn't see, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4437">Phew.</sentence><sentence id="4438">So he came and got me back up again.</sentence><sentence id="4439"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4440">That was scary.</sentence><sentence id="4441">I didn't scream, either.</sentence><sentence id="4442">Not a peep out of me, I wasn't giving anybody away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4537">Q: So you were walking for six nights?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4542">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="4543">And I mean, walking up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> is bad, you can't believe what it is to walk down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4544">You can't walk down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, you run, because there's no way -- anything to stop you.</sentence><sentence id="4545">It's so steep, you run.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4550">Q: Now one of these guys had a little dog with him, didn't he?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4552">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4553">Oh yeah, tha -- tha -- that's nice.</sentence><sentence id="4554">That -- I-I said to him -- that's the guy whose job I got through -- you know, who did some tricks, but he loved his dog.</sentence><sentence id="4555">Okay, fine.</sentence><sentence id="4556">A small German Shepherd, or young German Shepherd.</sentence><sentence id="4557">I says, he is totally insane, I couldn't talk him out of it.</sentence><sentence id="4558">All right.</sentence><sentence id="4559">So the first step, the first night, we're on the -- off a <span class="DLF">cliff</span> i-in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shepherd's hut</span>, you know, trying to get a little warm, you know, and get a little rest.</sentence><sentence id="4560">And it was on a <span class="DLF">cliff</span> overlooking down below.</sentence><sentence id="4561">After a little while, whatever it was, we're walking out of there and I'm the last guy out and I happen to look down there.</sentence><sentence id="4562">Down there's a German patrol with a Shepherd, and the Shepherd is barking to beat the band.</sentence><sentence id="4563">Why?</sentence><sentence id="4564">He smelled the other dog.</sentence><sentence id="4565">Not us so much as the dog.</sentence><sentence id="4566">Man, did we have to run, and the guy didn't even have any pepper or anything like that he could have sprinkled around on the <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4567">That was a good one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4584">Q: But the dog he had never barked?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4586">A: No [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4587">Q: That's quite amazing, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4588">A: Look, I don't analyze things, not at that time.</sentence><sentence id="4589">Later on you have time to analyze.</sentence><sentence id="4590">While it's happening there's no psychoanalysis, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4591">So after six days we're now faced -- oh yeah, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="4592">On the six days we met two more groups.</sentence><sentence id="4593">One group was people that were very well heeled, with the proper equipment, you know, mountain equipment you know, and -- and the shoes with spikes, and then the right kind of rucksack, you know, and the nice warm clothes, you know, filthy rich people.</sentence><sentence id="4594">They didn't like it any more either.</sentence><sentence id="4595">I don't know whether they were</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4598">4 Jewish or not, most -- more likely they're not.</sentence><sentence id="4599">And lo and behold I inherit five allied flyboys.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4600">Four Americans and a British.</sentence><sentence id="4601">They have -- have been channeled by the French underground all the way back to where our meeting point was.</sentence><sentence id="4602">You know, the French used to hide them at night.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4603">You know, maybe they came all the way -- I don't know from where, but they were shot down over, you know, <span class="REGION">German territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4604">So for some reason they -- the rich people went their own way -- they elected me as their leader.</sentence><sentence id="4605">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="4606">I'm not a soldier or anything like that, I'm their leader, hallelujah.</sentence><sentence id="4607">Same way I was the leader of the other dudes.</sentence><sentence id="4608">They all were older than me.</sentence><sentence id="4609">So we're facing this <span class="DLF">glacier</span> there, <span class="DLF">sheer wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4610">So the mountain man, he has this pick, you know this -- they got these things, they're those picks, and he's hacking a step into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ice</span>, one step at a time.</sentence><sentence id="4611">So here -- it's like a bunch of monkeys, we're all hanging on for dear life, one hand in this -- in -- in the step and the other one was standing there, and the guy in front of you is standing there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4612">Finally you make it to the top.</sentence><sentence id="4613">And the top is one sheer <span class="DLF">field</span> of ice, going down like this.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4614">Anyway you want to look at, sheer ice.</sentence><sentence id="4615">Well, we get to the top and guide says to me, well okay, this is th -- that -- this is one for the ages.</sentence><sentence id="4616">You follow that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and that will lead you to civilization.</sentence><sentence id="4617">I said to him, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4618">What -- what the heck are you talking about?</sentence><sentence id="4619">I don't see any <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4620">I have 20/20 vision, didn't see any <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4621">I says, you're in -- you're not going to leave me here.</sentence><sentence id="4622">You take me where that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> allegedly is.</sentence><sentence id="4623">Comes with me and it was ice, I'm telling you, it's like I said, it's a sheer glacier.</sentence><sentence id="4624">So -- and underneath, all of a sudden, there's a slight discoloration underneath the ice, it's grayish.</sentence><sentence id="4625">He says, you see that?</sentence><sentence id="4626">That's the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4627">You follow that, okay?</sentence><sentence id="4628">That's how a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> starts someplace, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="4629">I can vouch for it because it turned into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4630">So like good pedestrians, we walk on the right side of nothing, underneath the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4631">And slowly, slowly -- if you ha-have ever been to <span class="REGION">New Hampshire</span>, you see in those rapids over there, splashing over the stone.</sentence><sentence id="4632">Scary.</sentence><sentence id="4633">Not very deep, but scary when you don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="4634">So all ofa</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4638">5 sudden, we're on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to walk any more because there's a sheer cliff like that, the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> must have gouged it out.</sentence><sentence id="4639">But the opposite <span class="NPIP">side</span> is perfectly nice and flat.</sentence><sentence id="4640">There's only one thing wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4641">By now that quote, no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, was maybe, let me see, I want to keep it within the framework of reality.</sentence><sentence id="4642">Maybe 40 - 50 feet wide.</sentence><sentence id="4643">And it's [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="4644">So we took off our shoes and then we looked whether there was a stone to step on, and we made it to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4645">Now the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was mud, but was plenty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to walk, and it was like the Grand Canyon.</sentence><sentence id="4646">It was completely gouged out like this, yo -- you know?</sentence><sentence id="4647">It -- like a cover.</sentence><sentence id="4648">And we kept on walking and walking and walking and walking, there's hours, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4649">And the only sound that you heard once in awhile was the axe of a lumberjack, someplace, you know, that carries very far in the -- in an icy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with no other noise, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4650">And once in a blue moon we saw a Spaniard.</sentence><sentence id="4651">Now, two of the guys were Spanish Civil War veterans, so they spoke Spanish, so [indecipherable] you know, whatever, so a -- ah -- they thought we were Spaniards.</sentence><sentence id="4652">Here goes.</sentence><sentence id="4653">We come around the corner, and we froze.</sentence><sentence id="4654">What's in front of us like -- hard to say accurately, let's say 500 feet.</sentence><sentence id="4655">A platoon of Germans with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and everything.</sentence><sentence id="4656">I says, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.</sentence><sentence id="4657">And you know who was the most scared?</sentence><sentence id="4658">Hate to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="4659">The soldier boys.</sentence><sentence id="4660">They were going to hightail it.</sentence><sentence id="4661">I says, boys -- I spoke English -- as -- not as well as now, but spoke some English enough to get by.</sentence><sentence id="4662">I says, hold it.</sentence><sentence id="4663">If these are Germans they're going to shoot you the minute you start running.</sentence><sentence id="4664">Let's take it easy, they don't seem to be all that dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="4665">They keep on staring at the Germans there.</sentence><sentence id="4666">German helmet, German boots, German uniforms, German everything.</sentence><sentence id="4667">Something -- and all of a sudden I saw what was different.</sentence><sentence id="4668">The belt and the bandoliers were bright yellow.</sentence><sentence id="4669">Well, the Germans are either brown or black.</sentence><sentence id="4670">So then I knew they were Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4671">So we had no choice but to walk up to them.</sentence><sentence id="4672">So the allied sold --</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4677">Q: The soldiers were not German.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4678">A: Of course not, not with a b -- yellow bandolier, you know, and a yellow belt.</sentence><sentence id="4679">With -- the Germans have black and -- or brown.</sentence><sentence id="4680">You know, that's what -- that's what stopped me, I knew there was something different.</sentence><sentence id="4681">And so we walk up to them, and the other guys identified themselves as allied soldiers, showed their dogtag, whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="4682">They put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, drove them to the nearby <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in -- it must be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilbao</span> or some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="4683">Okay?They were home free.</sentence><sentence id="4684">Us, we don't deserve, because we weren't the only guys that came across, we don't deserve no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4685">We haven't walked enough, only six days, or six nights.</sentence><sentence id="4686">So we're walking, and we're schlepping, we're schlepping.</sentence><sentence id="4687">The next thing we know, they threw us into a <span

id="4769">The -- they -- they tho -- spanic -- <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> is very arid and poor, and all they grew was olive and

that.</sentence><sentence id="4775">The allies were smart.</sentence><sentence id="4776">So they bought all of their prisoners and th-that's how come the Spaniards had food.</sentence><sentence id="4777">And at for -- they got strangest eating ours, but that's not here nor there.</sentence><sentence id="4778">At four or five o'clock in the afternoon they made chocolate, you know, hot

how thick that chocolate is.</sentence><sentence id="4780">But we had a lot of nice food there.</sentence><sentence id="4781">That didn't last too long.</sentence><sentence id="4782">Then they threw
