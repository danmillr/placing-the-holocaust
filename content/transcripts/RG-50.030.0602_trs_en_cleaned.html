class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my mother said to me, Let's go for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="230">And she looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="231">She said, Your shoe lace is

4'11.</sentence><sentence id="235">She stood me up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> so she could tie my shoes.</sentence><sentence id="236">And I'm standing there, she's tying

id="238">These two guys came in, and they had rain coats and snap-brim hats and the whole bit.</sentence><sentence id="239">And they said is -- is your husband here?</sentence><sentence id="240">And my mother said, No.</sentence><sentence id="241">He's -- and my mother was one of these very nervous people.</sentence><sentence id="242">And she said, No.</sentence><sentence id="243">He's not here.</sentence><sentence id="244">They said, We need to look around.</sentence><sentence id="245">And my mother said, Okay.</sentence><sentence id="246">And so they walked in -- and I'm five years old and I'm toddling behind them.</sentence><sentence id="247">I'm -- and they went into my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">study</span> which was I remember it because it had green shades you know, in the old days instead of white shades there was a green shade.</sentence><sentence id="248">So the sunlight was always filtered and I remember distinctly one of them walking to my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, reaching into his coat, taking out his gun, and laying it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> under my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">And then the other one went over and said, Oh, what's this?</sentence><sentence id="250">And he picked the gun up and he turned to my -- went to my mother and said, Is this yours?</sentence><sentence id="251">And my mother said, No.</sentence><sentence id="252">And he said, Well, you're going to have to come with us.</sentence><sentence id="253">And she said, Well, why?</sentence><sentence id="254">He said, Well, do you have somebody who can take care of him?</sentence><sentence id="255">And so my mother went up and got one of the -- one of the neighbors to take care of me "till my grandmother could come and collect us.</sentence><sentence id="256">And that the last time I saw my mother and father "till spring of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="257">And they went to the <span class="BUILDING">downtown Vienna prison</span>, and I understand for the two years they were in the <span class="BUILDING">downtown Vienna prison</span> they saw each other one time in the <span class="DLF">exercise yard</span> and never talked.</sentence><sentence id="258">But you have to understand here is a woman who has had the best of everything and she's living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">wing</span> with 200 women, one <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, no <span class="DLF">doors</span>; one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, no <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">But through this entire time, my former nanny used to come and collect her laundry and do her laundry for her, you know, what little rags she had.</sentence><sentence id="260">And she -- it was just kind of ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisoeecion Interview with Paul Halpern 10 different, you know.</sentence><sentence id="261">So we -- we went to -- we went to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that's -- if you're going to record this, this is -- my grandfather, right after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the troops were in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, went on a normal business trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">And about three days later, my mother got -- my grandmother got a letter.</sentence><sentence id="263">And the letter said, By the time you get this letter.</sentence><sentence id="264">I'm on my way to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">I am not coming back.</sentence><sentence id="266">They don't want you.</sentence><sentence id="267">They want me.</sentence><sentence id="268">So sometime in the next week they will come and say to you, Where's your husband?</sentence><sentence id="269">And you show them this letter, and they're going to say, When is he coming back?</sentence><sentence id="270">And you're going to say, He's not coming back.</sentence><sentence id="271">Just show them the letter, and eventually they'll let you go because they don't want you.</sentence><sentence id="272">Sign over anything they want, give them anything you want -- they want, and they'll let you go -- because this is still early on.</sentence><sentence id="273">And that's exactly how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="274">And so, finally, after about by the spring of "39, my grandmother's arranging for us to go into Kindertransport, and they said, Just sign here.</sentence><sentence id="275">Give us the bill and then sign over and get out.</sentence><sentence id="276">And she said, Not until I put my kids -- my grandkids on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And they said, No, you have to get out.</sentence><sentence id="278">She said, No.</sentence><sentence id="279">I'm not getting out until they get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">That's how tough she was.</sentence><sentence id="281">And she was the only member of my family who was over 5'6, you know.</sentence><sentence id="282">So she was the queen.</sentence><sentence id="283">She put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and she went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>; and she joined her husband who was -- he had guts.</sentence><sentence id="284">I mean, he played -- he played with people's lives, but he -- he knew human nature.</sentence><sentence id="285">He knew that as long as they got what they wanted they were going to -- and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and I remember the -- I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</sentence><sentence id="286">And, you know, a little them -- them memories and I had my father's brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and he had come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with his wife, Auga (ph), Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Paul Halpern 11</span> as a domestic.</sentence><sentence id="287">They signed on as a couple, and Auga (ph) came over pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="288">So their son, Ralph, was born in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and was a British subject, and did very well.</sentence><sentence id="289">He is a Lord of the British Emperor.</sentence><sentence id="290">His name is Sir Ralph Halpern, and he was chairman of the board of <span class="BUILDING">Burton Industries</span>, and he now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Beach</span>, and my -- my son and he are good friends.</sentence><sentence id="291">And I see them occasionally, and he was always a -- always a Brit and he's always been a Brit.</sentence><sentence id="292">Calls me Dear Boy and he's six years younger than I am.</sentence><sentence id="293">And it's kind of racy, and I -- he and I have a good time together.</sentence><sentence id="294">And -- and but there was nowhere we could stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- we could stay with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">We'd stay a couple of days, and then went down to <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> and Dan (ph) Court to -- Kindertransport.</sentence><sentence id="296">They made an arrangement for the kids who did not have -- weren't going to be taken there by families.</sentence><sentence id="297">There was -- there were these <span class="DLF">estates</span> out by Kent, and they brought in an educator from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> named Anna Essinger and who was the most magnificent teacher.</sentence><sentence id="298">I was there 16 months, and I stayed in one <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my sister stayed in the other <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">And I can't tell you whether I was in <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Dan Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">I think I was in <span class="BUILDING">Bunce Court</span> because it comes easier to my mind, but, you know, the memories are strange.</sentence><sentence id="301">All I know is that I did a lot of schooling because I jumped like three years when I came here immediately because they thought I was a poor refugee kid until I -- I told them -- they put me in the second grade.</sentence><sentence id="302">I could read.</sentence><sentence id="303">I could do math.</sentence><sentence id="304">I -- I had a little bit of chemistry.</sentence><sentence id="305">I knew European History because that's what that's what the regimen there was, and the -- they -- the -- the -- the bombings were pretty bad around that <span class="REGION">area</span> because a lot of <span class="BUILDING">fighter bases</span> were in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, and we got sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and -- which is interesting because then the Brits started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for sure.</sentence><sentence id="306">And Interview with Paul Halpern 12 the Brits -- Britains decided to have their own Kindertransport and, they went and signed up 30,000 children to get them first to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and
