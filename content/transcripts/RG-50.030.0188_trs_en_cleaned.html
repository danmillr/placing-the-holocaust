<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: What was the life like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: It was bad.</sentence><sentence id="81">There wasn't enough food but I remember because of my grandfather's connection, because he lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, you know, and a lot of people worked for him, he would constantly send a non-Jewish peasant over with food, but there came a time where they wouldn't let him through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were practically starved and there were no facilities to wash, you know.</sentence><sentence id="82">Sometimes they would cut off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">Things were pretty bad.</sentence><sentence id="84">01:06: A lot of people, the older people started to die because there was no doctors around.</sentence><sentence id="85">The doctors were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> earlier and we knew that sooner or later they're going to either kill us or take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, the younger people, and that one night that I remember so well, we were told to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">For some reason my father wouldn't leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">I don't remember why I was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, because my mother and my sisters were not and they came in.</sentence><sentence id="88">They broke down the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked.</sentence><sentence id="90">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="91">My father had a talis (prayershawl) on.</sentence><sentence id="92">He prayed.</sentence><sentence id="93">And they killed him in front of my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="94">I really don't remember what went what went through my mind.</sentence><sentence id="95">I didn't cry.</sentence><sentence id="96">I didn't scream.</sentence><sentence id="97">I just ran around the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I got <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span> there were people running and there were several of us young girls and some of the German soldiers that surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> let us go through and I remember one of them gave us a battery, light.</sentence><sentence id="99">I don't know...maybe he meant for us just to run.</sentence><sentence id="100">It was dark and to try to save ourselves and this was like the first time that I realized 01:08: that maybe not all of them are bad, because he he could have killed us.</sentence><sentence id="101">I think there were three or four of us.</sentence><sentence id="102">When I think of that moment I can't understand that I didn't take time to make sure that my father is indeed dead.</sentence><sentence id="103">They could have shot him and he could have been alive and suffering.</sentence><sentence id="104">I just cannot explain that and I have a lot of guilt about it and to this day I think about it and the only explanation that I could give you and I have given maybe to myself is that the will of surviving was so strong that I couldn't think of him.</sentence><sentence id="105">I wanted to live for a better world or to tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="106">I was always afraid that all the suffering would be forgotten and there's nobody going to be there to tell the story, and I started to run.</sentence><sentence id="107">I ran through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="109">Some people, peasants, would would give us bread.</sentence><sentence id="110">I don't realize that they knew we were Jews, you know.</sentence><sentence id="111">Some of them had a hard life.</sentence><sentence id="112">They worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and there were people wandering around.</sentence><sentence id="113">01:10: Well some of them probably didn't even know about the political situation.</sentence><sentence id="114">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where they wouldn't give us any bread or any water and they would say, you're probably Jews and you're wandering around.</sentence><sentence id="115">And we tried to stay away from better looking <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, worrying that those people were better educated and they might recognize us.</sentence><sentence id="116">I lost track of time.</sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't know where I was at times, you know...what's going to happen to us and there were times that I really didn't want to live because we didn't know what tomorrow's going to be.</sentence><sentence id="118">You know, some people seem kind.</sentence><sentence id="119">Some people would point out to you and say, if you don't get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we're going to tell the Germans and they're going to come and get you.</sentence><sentence id="120">And it didn't take long before we were arrested, and we were taken to some...the difference between a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> wasn't much really, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> kind of kept you a couple of days and they weren't as well organized as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so it was very easy to walk out and to escape.</sentence><sentence id="121">And I remember walking away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> with some...at that time I called him older man because I was like fourteen or fourteen and a half years old, and they told us that not too far there's some religious installation.</sentence><sentence id="122">It's a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and they are helping a lot of people and I walked in to this...it didn't...to me it looked like a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> because in in the front of this big <span class="BUILDING">building</span>...it wasn't actually a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but there was a like a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, a big cemetery plot and then we noticed nuns dressed in habits 01:12: and we waited until not too many people were around.</sentence><sentence id="123">There were like four of us I believe, and we walked in and we told them that we needed help, that we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and they asked us if we were Jews and we told them.</sentence><sentence id="124">I mean at that point there was no place of hiding and I had a feeling that if nuns are not going to help us, you know, then there's no sense going on, and they told us they were crowded, that they had a lot of infants.</sentence><sentence id="125">They had a lot of sick people and they indeed did, but this Mother Superior that I called it... Theresa was her name, Mother Theresa.</sentence><sentence id="126">By the way, they were Carmelites, and there were a lot of Volksdeutsche.</sentence><sentence id="127">You know what a Volksdeutsche is?</sentence><sentence id="128">The mother can be Polish and the father can be German.</sentence><sentence id="129">A lot of them were mixed, and they took us in and they told us that we had to be very quiet and it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where they put us and sometimes we did chores for them and they gave us some food and they really didn't know how long we could stay because they were constantly being watched by neighbors, you know, and sometimes they could tell them stories so they could explain what was going on but most of the time they didn't see any of the police, any of the German police and we stayed there for several months and slowly they tried to explain to us that things are getting very bad and they are threatened they would kill them if they would find out how many Jews they had.</sentence><sentence id="130">They had quite a few later on we found out.</sentence><sentence id="131">We heard the babies cry at night.</sentence><sentence id="132">01:14: We saw corpses being taken out of very old people and finally they told us that we have to go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Did they give you anything while you were there, any...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Well, they gave us cross and a prayer book.</sentence><sentence id="193">They tried very much to convert us and some of them did.</sentence><sentence id="194">I was kind of scared, you know.</sentence><sentence id="195">I told them that I believe in my God, that I'm Jewish and I was scared that my Jewish...you know, I was a child, you know.</sentence><sentence id="196">I told them in my own words that if I accept your religion my God's going to punish me and I was scared to do it and I said I respect your religion.</sentence><sentence id="197">I would always respect it and if it can save my life I'll wear your cross and I'll treasure that prayer book that I still have and I want the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> to have.</sentence><sentence id="198">I memorized all the prayers and when we parted they gave me a peasant blouse to wear so I wouldn't look suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="199">I would look like a peasant.</sentence><sentence id="200">And this was a very sad time to part with them because you had like a little security and I remember feeling good.</sentence><sentence id="201">They would take us into the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> to pray, you know, and they would make us kneel and it just felt good after the prayer.</sentence><sentence id="202">You know, I kept saying to myself, God, there's nobody Jewish to pray with me, therefore I have to pray with them and when we parted it was very sad and it was like dying 01:16: and I even told...there was one nun that took a special liking to me and every time she looked at me she would cry and she wanted me so much to stay there because she kept saying that I looked less Jewish than the others and there's really no such thing as looking Jewish, but because I was a red-head and the Germans believed that every Jew has dark hair and a big nose and dark complexion...it wasn't, it wasn't so at all.</sentence><sentence id="203">My mom had very fair complexion and I was always very fair, and it was very hard for this nun to part with me.</sentence><sentence id="204">She wanted me to stay but they were afraid and they let us go and this is how I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">Pretty soon they rounded us up.</sentence><sentence id="206"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> was in the beginning to me...I can't say salvation but it was like a relief.</sentence><sentence id="207">Like I didn't have to run anymore.</sentence><sentence id="208">I knew it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I saw a pile of dead people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I saw conditions and I heard screams but in the beginning I was kind of happy because I knew that tonight I can stay here, that I don't have to run through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because there's no one that extended a hand anymore like the nuns did.</sentence><sentence id="209">By the way, I'll go back to the nuns.</sentence><sentence id="210">They were very, very good to me, to us and I want you all to know that they risked their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="211">They didn't have much food and they shared it with us.</sentence><sentence id="212">My... 01:18</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: How did you get from the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: We were just wandering around...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">I really didn't know where I was.</sentence><sentence id="243">If you asked me where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> was, near what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="244">It didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="245">If you saw a crowd of people you kind of turned around because you were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="246">Everyone looked suspicious.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="253">After leaving the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> we weren't dirty because we always had some water facilities you know to wash but when they they rounded us up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where they took people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to run.</sentence><sentence id="254">They took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> was, turned out to be later on a pretty horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, especially for a young girl.</sentence><sentence id="256">I...at one point I didn't know that they had younger children than me but later on I found out that they had a lot of infants and nobody could approach that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> because apparently they would kill the infants and make lamp shades out of baby skins or soap from baby fat.</sentence><sentence id="257">We could smell it.</sentence><sentence id="258">We heard sometimes screams but we never saw it.</sentence><sentence id="259">Then there was another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> that where the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were always covered with chalk and sometimes we would come back from hard work...we would dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> or whatever they would</sentence></p><p><sentence id="260">01:20: ask us to do.</sentence><sentence id="261">By the way, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had a lot of Russian prisoners and they had high officers that lived separated from everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="262">They were treated much better.</sentence><sentence id="263">They would interrogate them, maybe get some secrets from them, because I noticed that they were bringing them food and a couple of times they sent us to clean their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they had given us food.</sentence><sentence id="264">This is when I realized that they had some important Russian officers there.</sentence><sentence id="265">Then one day, and this is a a very difficult thing for me to talk, but it's history.</sentence><sentence id="266">We were asking a lot of questions.</sentence><sentence id="267">What is in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>?</sentence><sentence id="268">What is in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>?</sentence><sentence id="269">And that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the chalk kind of interested me because sometimes I would hear screams and I would see German soldiers taking women there, women that were maybe at that time maybe in their twenties or maybe older.</sentence><sentence id="270">They were developed a lot better.</sentence><sentence id="271">They were pretty women and apparently they made some medical experiments, because through one <span class="DLF">window</span> we peeked and we saw some men naked in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tubs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">They were metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tubs</span>, with ice and they would freeze them to a certain temperature and they would let the women undress and I guess they wanted to see the sexual reaction and this was horrible to watch and pretty soon it was the turn for us. (</sentence><sentence id="273">Pause) (Crying) This is when you . (</sentence><sentence id="274">Pause) And if you didn't do what they wanted you to do, you'll be beaten up something terrible, or you were put under cold showers. (</sentence><sentence id="275">Crying) Now I remember the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> at</sentence></p><p><sentence id="276">01:23: one time came and we were moved to a different <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And then we heard rumors.</sentence><sentence id="278">A lot of the...there were a lot of Poles, there weren't only Jews...there were some Poles, political prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="279">There were even some Germans that were political opponents and we heard rumors that they were going to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we had ovens.</sentence><sentence id="280">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> but I never got to see them, and we heard screams but we never got to see them, but apparently the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> weren't big enough...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Before we move on, let me...can we go back a little bit to what your experiences that you were talking about at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>, what they did?</sentence><sentence id="282">Could you be a little...tell us a little more detail?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I think it was...I think they just wanted to see the men suffer and us suffer but you know, when we saw the women that, you know, when a fourteen or fifteen year old girl that doesn't have to eat, it's rather ugly.</sentence><sentence id="284">Her head shaven looks...some of the women were rather, you know, developed.</sentence><sentence id="285">You know, they were older.</sentence><sentence id="286">I don't even remember having any breasts, you know, and when you saw what they did...they threw them, you know, on top of the men and they wanted to see the reaction and they actually tried to force the man to have sex with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: What was your experience?</sentence><sentence id="292">Tell what they asked you to do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: They asked us to do the similar thing, but most of the time the men were like dead and it was just a horrible thing 01:25: doing that, and the screams and and I remember I asked to be killed. (</sentence><sentence id="296">Crying) (Pause) I just couldn't go through it.</sentence><sentence id="297">They they stopped it and this was apparently...later on we found out that it was a group of doctors were conducting this experiment for their own selfish maybe... I really can't explain it.</sentence><sentence id="298">I read a book about it, that they were abnormal people, that they just got a kick seeing people suffer like that.</sentence><sentence id="299">Pretty soon when we heard rumors that we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we decided that no matter what, we're not going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">We're going to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or we're going to do something.</sentence><sentence id="301">We're going to kill ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="302">We didn't have any weapons and we thought maybe we'll get some poison, you know, and you couldn't really talk, you know.</sentence><sentence id="303">You would gather doing work and you would...somebody would say something, but then one night indeed they took us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> supposedly was taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">And at one point they told us when we tell you to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, you must do it.</sentence><sentence id="305">If not, you're going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">You don't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="307">And we jumped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">I was shot.</sentence><sentence id="309">You can still see a <span class="DLF">hole</span>, but I...they picked me up.</sentence><sentence id="310">It wasn't too bad, and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>...there was so much confusion.</sentence><sentence id="311">There were a lot of people...there were hundreds of people, and they put us on a transport of forced labor that was going into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">I don't know if you're familiar with it.</sentence><sentence id="313">They would take a lot of young people...very seldom Jews because Jews were already rounded up and and they were in camps, but there were a lot of Russian, Ukrainians and Polish young people and they forced them to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so they could work on their <span class="DLF">fields</span>, because the German soldiers were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">They were fighting the war, so that's how I got
