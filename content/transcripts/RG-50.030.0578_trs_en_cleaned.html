<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: And that was April the 12", the morning of April -- when -- when Company G, and the 80" division came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>, and the 319" came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and they sent a message to the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>, surrender the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, or we will attack it with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and artillery.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="447">Q: Okay, so it was infantry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: It was infantry.</sentence><sentence id="450">And they came up and all of us, each regiment had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored unit</span>

in</sentence><sentence id="471">8 case that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> come, or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="472">So, we were there.</sentence><sentence id="473">We kept seeing these people who were in striped suits.</sentence><sentence id="474">Not many, but we would see them once in awhile, walk by.</sentence><sentence id="475">Finally Captain Namkowitz(ph) told Percy Smith, who was the first sergeant of G Company, he said, Percy, he says, you take down Smith the Jeep driver in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and get Myers, and you guys go see if you can find out where the hell these guys are coming from.</sentence><sentence id="476">He said, wa -- where are they coming from?</sentence><sentence id="477">He said, we'd see -- they must be a -- a

what is this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, anyway?</sentence><sentence id="497">And the guy says, ein minute, ein minute.</sentence><sentence id="498">He goes into a <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, what the hell is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="506">He said, well, we furnish -- he said, they come here and this is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="507">He said, there's other little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> all around, at the industries and out in the <span class="DLF">farms</span>, that furnish labor from here.</sentence><sentence id="508">And he said -- Percy said, well, who's in charge here?He said, well, the SSers were until last night, and they heard that you were headed this way, and, he said, they ran.</sentence><sentence id="509">He said, there was about 3,000 of them here.</sentence><sentence id="510">We said, 3,000?</sentence><sentence id="511">And he said yes, he said, there was approximately 3,000 here before you came here.</sentence><sentence id="512">He said, how many people are in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, anyway?</sentence><sentence id="513">Well, we could see -- now, where we came in, there were low one, just one story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that looked like they had been put up in a hurry.</sentence><sentence id="514">They had just -- I don't know whether it was straw board, or what, but it wasn't -- it -- it was -- looked like temporary <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="515">And so he said, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> here, is -- is the <span class="REGION">west part</span> -- he said,</sentence><sentence id="517">ontectreferarnetaushariarg tr hither btrmedortabnattfiexalialon 0 the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> is over there.</sentence><sentence id="518">Well, we didn't know that there was a name -- main <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">And later on, we found out that other people from 317 had come in on the front side of the <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, but he said, they didn't even come in.</sentence><sentence id="521">They just were here for a short time, and he said, they left.</sentence><sentence id="522">And we said, well, what did you have to -- what are you eating?</sentence><sentence id="523">And he said, well, he said, the SSers had some potato peelings that they had peeled yesterday and threw in the <span class="DLF">dump</span>, and he said, we got them and washed them, and then, he said, we went over there and got green grass and brought over and put in with that, and he said, that's all we've had to eat today.</sentence><sentence id="524">So, we went inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, just to the first row of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, and in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, they had people laying out, and Percy says, what happened to them?Oh, they just died.</sentence><sentence id="525">They just died.</sentence><sentence id="526">And about that time, here come six guys pulling a two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> up from around the corner, down below.</sentence><sentence id="527">And they were picking

week.</sentence><sentence id="535">And -- so Percy said, how many people are here?He said, well, we think there is about 26,000 here now.</sentence><sentence id="536">And Percy said, who's in</sentence><sentence id="538">ontectnstonancedjusimtneey for tarher biormatberabouttfistecion 1 charge?</sentence><sentence id="539">Well, we have a committee that's in charge, but, he said, really nobody's in charge.</sentence><sentence id="540">He said, a bunch of them took off after the SSers.</sentence><sentence id="541">He said, they broke into the armament, and they are after the SSers now.</sentence><sentence id="542">And he said, we've got ninet -- now I'm --I--I might be wrong, but he said -- I think that he said, we have 19 of them locked up on the other <span

have some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with some food and blankets and medicine up there tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="546">So, I was assigned with my five man -- six man, I was assigned from the 13", the 14"" and up until about noon on the 15" to go around and pick up these guys that were in -- s- straggling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and to take them back out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for -- so that they could get medicine.</sentence><sentence id="547">And some of the fellows didn't want to go back out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">But we told them that they were gonna be food out there, the best we could.</sentence><sentence id="549">Tried to tell them, but we had one fellow that was at the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and he came out of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> eating a potato that must have weighed a

our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">je</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, and he fell over.</sentence><sentence id="552">Well, we picked him up, put him in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the Jeep</span> and took him back out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and Dr. Bob out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out there and by that time they had set up some medics also that had got there.</sentence><sentence id="553">And he said, this poor guy, he didn't weigh 60 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="554">He said, this poor guy was e -- we told him what happened, and he said, well, probably the starch in the potato was just</sentence><sentence id="556">2 too much for his system and he just can't handle it, he just couldn't handle it.</sentence><sentence id="557">So, on the 15", then, I was r -- they -- I was relieved by -- now, I --I think it was people -- fellows from a cavalry that replaced us, but by that time then,
