<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2642">Q: And that's why they used them --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2643">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2644">Q: -- because they lost their velocity before they'd hit the other <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2668">Q: Okay, so why do you bel -- do you think -- have you given a full story, according -- you know, according to what you believe we need to know about what was the true professionalism of the pilots and those who were piloting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider planes</span>, or is there more that you want to add to show that they really did know their stuff?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: Well, the best evidence is the fact that they got the presidential citation -- it's either the presidential or war department sar -- citation, some call it presidential.</sentence><sentence id="2671">A citation as being the only group of a -- of the -- the thousand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> that were flying, the only group to win that award.</sentence><sentence id="2672">And then the 88", other group that liberated your actual <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> there, also the 88", won the same distinguished citation, as a unit citation.</sentence><sentence id="2673">Every member of the group could wear the ribbon.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2703">A: And we ax -- when I say we, some of the troop carrier people, such as Major Gates, who's now Colonel Gates, and he wrote an email to me that was very revealing, he said -- he's the one that said that not one troop carrier pilot to his knowledge -- and he was quite h-high up there, had ever been interviewed for this.</sentence><sentence id="2704">So although we -- it was a wonderful movie, and a very successful movie -- we can't blame any of the actors, or we can't blame any of the participants in it, cause they had no knowledge that he had not interviewed any of these.</sentence><sentence id="2705">However, the damage had been done.</sentence><sentence id="2706">And a lawsuit was started -- was started by the troop carrier group against Ambrose, not against "Band of Brothers."</sentence><sentence id="2707">And it was proceeding at the time he died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2713">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2715">A: Ambrose died, and then the -- the troop carrier grou-group dropped the lawsuit.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2737">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2742">A: Said that we were such a big force in ending the war, so -- and so was the ground troops that fought from battle -- from <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> and so forth, I'm taking nothing away from them.</sentence><sentence id="2743">They did a great job and a great number of them died.</sentence><sentence id="2744">And so did a great number of the people in for -- in the ninth troop carrier command.</sentence><sentence id="2745">They also died.</sentence><sentence id="2746">So my feeling that liberators, we were the pre-liberators if you cou -- you might put it that way.</sentence><sentence id="2747">We shortened the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2754">Q: Okay, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2756">A: Had it not been for us serving -- supplying gasoline as fast as we did to Patton, those ground troops that liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> would not have been there yet.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2766">That you think is --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2767">A: No, I think that's basically the thing that I -- that's driven me for -- in trying to piece the whole thing together, particularly in the last two years, because I didn't know the whole story, I cou --I did -- I couldn't put it together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
