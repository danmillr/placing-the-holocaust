<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Well, they had two types of schooling.</sentence><sentence id="189">There was a man there by the name of Saul Livery (ph).</sentence><sentence id="190">Does the name ring a bell?.</sentence><sentence id="191"><span class="BUILDING">Saul Livery</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">He was the spirit of Judaism in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">He decided that even though we're in these dismal surroundings, there's one thing that we need to know.</sentence><sentence id="194">We have to know our heritage.</sentence><sentence id="195">We have to know our history.</sentence><sentence id="196">We have to know our literature.</sentence><sentence id="197">And so Saul Livery was the spirit that motivated and energized not just the Yeshiva learning, but that the Jews should know literature and history even on a Hebraic (ph) secular level.</sentence><sentence id="198">Hebrew literature, see.</sentence><sentence id="199">He wanted to teach them Hebrew so he formed a series of religious schooling which was the saving grace of these young people.</sentence><sentence id="200">Then they had to have their secular schooling so there were there were two great <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> - one was the Kaduri (ph) School and the other was another <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which I, slips my mind but I have it in my notes, and in these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> the children went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to learn their secular subjects.</sentence><sentence id="201">When I came in to the little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span>, I found out that they had nothing to write on.</sentence><sentence id="202">The kids would pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of paper from the trash and pick up a piece of black slate that writes and these were their notebooks.</sentence><sentence id="203">And I saw that.</sentence><sentence id="204">I thought I must do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="205">So I sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they sent me books and and paper and notebooks and pencils and so on - the greatest gift.</sentence><sentence id="206">Imagine children considering it the greatest gift I could give them.</sentence><sentence id="207">When I came one day to their to their little <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and I handed out notebooks with pencils, with pens, with books, with with all the equipment that they needed.</sentence><sentence id="208">They said I revolutionized the the school system in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because we gave them pens and pencils.</sentence><sentence id="209">When I think of what a gift means to somebody - they they they kissed my hands, the kids, for for the fact that I brought them this.</sentence><sentence id="210">The same as after that first service.</sentence><sentence id="211">At at the end of that first service I'm standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span> trying to see who these people are as they leave to say goodbye, and they started kissing my chaplain's insignia which I have there.</sentence><sentence id="212">The Jewish, because I had a Jewish star on it - they say you brought freedom, freedom to us and these, the whole the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> felt that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> saved them.</sentence><sentence id="213">That we brought freedom to the people from the Nazi empire.</sentence><sentence id="214">It was a very thrilling moment in in American history when we were considered the proponents of freedom.</sentence><sentence id="215">It's being recapitulated right now in every country of <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> that that that when you .. OK.Any other questions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me some more about other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the vic...uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that you visited.</sentence><sentence id="247">Tell me about <span class="BUILDING">people's homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">What were they like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well, the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that I visited, and I'll give you an example of this bar mitzvah - I went into a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">They must have had about five or six in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">They they they went from hand to mouth as far as food is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="256">Uh some standing on <span class="DLF">food lines</span> and some uh trying to eke out a living from each other, just like in in the ancient in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of of of former times, of of three, four hundred years ago.</sentence><sentence id="257">What I found most exciting was the fact that the the Judaism which to many of them had never meant anything, I found that the the Jews of the survivors went one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="258">I thought that most of them would turn against their faith and I thought that as I went in one <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after another these were survivors and these were the children and these were children without any parents who they adopted as their own.</sentence><sentence id="259">As I went into these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> I felt why would they want to carry on this heritage where there they were told - by the way some of them are so assimilated, so far-removed from anything Jewish - they looked so German that they could be an example of blonde hair, blue eyes, clipped - an example of German aristocracy, and went into their pitiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and saw their lovely children, saw that these children weren't even their children.</sentence><sentence id="260">They were adopting orphans who - by the way that's quite a story that these orphans were brought half way around the world and I found out later, you remember there's a story about Hannah Szenes [NB: Sennesh] who who who said I'm a match that was not to be consumed, where she volunteered to help save - I found out that Haganah, that the Jewish underground, had formed a <span class="DLF">railway</span> and taken youngsters and put them into Christian homes who put their lives on the stake to save Jewish kids where the kids would be hidden in these <span class="BUILDING">Christian homes</span> by day, and in the evening, at sunset they would pick them up and ride them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and ride them to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they had another <span class="BUILDING">Christian home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">I didn't know that story.</sentence><sentence id="262">And here I find that these kids were telling about the Israelis who who from from Haganah, went out there to save these kids.</sentence><sentence id="263">This was a chapter that that that really was hair-raising to me, to find these kids saved from in that kind of situation.</sentence><sentence id="264">As far as the - let me give you this bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="265">Here's a lovely little kid, little boy who would have known nothing if it weren't for the fact that a fellow like Saul Livery so to it that there was Jewish education.</sentence><sentence id="266">And took the few that knew Jewish education and made <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> around them.</sentence><sentence id="267">By the way, not only <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> - they created a choir, a choir of forty voices that came and sang at my first service.</sentence><sentence id="268">They had uh men with such beautiful voices - they called them cantors.</sentence><sentence id="269">They had operatic voices.</sentence><sentence id="270">I had an operatic singer conducting my Friday night service.</sentence><sentence id="271">With such a voice I wish I had video and I wish I had sound recording to hear that voice.</sentence><sentence id="272">To me it was, an operatic tenor like like Jan Peerce or Richard Tucker the days of...so here was my service where these people walked in and and and they - forty voice choir.</sentence><sentence id="273">An operatic singer to help me conduct a service, so at the beginning it was very cold because they did their Germanic music and I didn't get in to it.</sentence><sentence id="274">It wasn't until they let me take over with an opening hymn "Shma Israel" that the whole group got together.</sentence><sentence id="275">That that's an aside.</sentence><sentence id="276">But the beauty of that experience is that I see this youngster who could easily - first of all, how he survived - he was an orphan - how he survived the Nazi massacre and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> in itself is is beyond understanding.</sentence><sentence id="277">Since he was only thirteen he wasn't one of those that wrote my compositions, so I started to talk with him and its another one of those stories.</sentence><sentence id="278">He he saw his - the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> - he he saw them take his father and his mother and his sister and he were left and then and then two days later his sister was taken because she was a beautiful girl, and this kid saw it at four, five, six years old and he's telling this story and now he's going to be bar mitzvahed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>, all alone.</sentence><sentence id="279">His mother disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="280">So this is the kind of story that I got in in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and when you get it directly, when you hear it from a kid's lips, it's different than than the whole six million story again and again.</sentence><sentence id="281">It's just different.</sentence><sentence id="282">A bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="283">This kid to have such a Jewish bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="284">When they had to celebrate after the service, I, they said come and join us in a drink.</sentence><sentence id="285">They had one bottle of schnapps, of liquor, which they had kept for the whole year and every time they take a few they fill it with water.</sentence><sentence id="286">They filled the bottle with water so it says liquor.</sentence><sentence id="287">I said I don't drink.</sentence><sentence id="288">They says this you can drink.</sentence><sentence id="289">I said I don't drink.</sentence><sentence id="290">They said this you can drink.</sentence><sentence id="291">Take a look.</sentence><sentence id="292">I'm drinking water.</sentence><sentence id="293">But they have a big bottle of Jewish liquor, uh liquor, and they, everybody drinks it as if LALHAIM (ph) and they make believe they're they're getting drunk on it.</sentence><sentence id="294">It's the same.</sentence><sentence id="295">They have five bottles like that, practically all water, but this was their their schnapps.</sentence><sentence id="296">This was their SABBATH THING and a little old piece of herring which was this big - I didn't want to take anything because here I come from where we have everything in the service.</sentence><sentence id="297">They insisted.</sentence><sentence id="298">From their nothingness they insisted that I have something.</sentence><sentence id="299">So I have a picture of one of these bigger <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, a big <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where we were meeting sabbath morning, after the service.</sentence><sentence id="300">So there's a a little bit of the flavor of what I'm talking about in in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">Now I can, I don't know -
