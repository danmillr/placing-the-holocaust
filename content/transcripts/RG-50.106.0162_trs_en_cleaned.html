<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: We were not affected by that.</sentence><sentence id="245">In other words, due to the treaty, what the boycott was in the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, 1936 was in -- was when it hit <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: As far as memories is concerned, the only thing I -- I do remember my father's parents had a small <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span>, again on the main square, and I remember their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which was above the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I realize they did not have -- they only had one <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with running water, and for washing they still took a basin with a jug for the hot water.</sentence><sentence id="251">So this must have been around 1934, because my grandmother died of a stroke in 1935, after which my grandfather closed up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> to be near my parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: So at the time, let's say, of the Nuremburg rally in 1935, your parents didn't talk about this with you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: It was -- it didn't affect us, therefore a lot of -- a-also, my father didn't lose his hospital privileges until 1936.</sentence><sentence id="257">Many other physicians left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, for instance in</sentence><sentence id="259">12 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 1933 and 1934, because after the boycott, they saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">It didn't show up til much later in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>, so that it also had the fact that fewer people really saw the urgency of leaving.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: So when were the first restrictions, besides the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, that you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Mainly that we couldn't go into certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and that we more or less were given maps of what we could and what we couldn't do.</sentence><sentence id="271">But it didn't stop our movement, but rather, there are just certain things which one doesn't do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Did --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: And we took it in that sense, that same as parents said you don't -- you don't cross the main <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Did you ever question any of this to your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Just that as si -- that it wasn't safe and that there are en-enough things for me to do without it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: When did you see your first swastika?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Probably quite early, because it was on every stamp, it was on every government -- <span class="BUILDING">government building</span>, but it was taken as something that -- that existed, but didn't have the same connotations --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Same connotations of what?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: -- that we see now, of -- that it was a serious threat.</sentence><sentence id="285">And, in fact, most people</sentence></p><p><sentence id="288">P Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 felt it would blow over and wouldn't last, particularly my mother's parents, who had celebrated the hundredth anniversary of a wholesale leather business with a tannery in 1933, and survived in very good shape through the hunger of World War I, when they could always barter leather for food at the local -- from the local farmers.</sentence><sentence id="289">And felt they were pretty much immune from anything that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="290">They really didn't appreciate what ha -- what was going on until Kristallnacht.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Frank Liebermann.</sentence><sentence id="293">This is tape number one, side B. When did you first hear about a man called Adolf Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Probably around 1935, because one did listen to speeches and the fact that he was able to arouse almost riotous reactions, and people started talking about what was going to happen next.</sentence><sentence id="295">Again, wa -- how political is a five year old, and I couldn't really absorb what was going on in the same way as my parents, who obviously were quite concerned, as I said, whether it's a ocean voyage, learning English and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="296">That became pretty clear even before the end of the treaty,</sentence><sentence id="298">14 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 and I'd say around 1935.</sentence><sentence id="299">By the time I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was in 1935, it was already fully segregated and I just thought that's the way it had to be.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Well, I -- I would say I'm -- I -- I've become a student of history, Biblical and otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="1603">And if you do that, you realize that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has always done well in a free society.</sentence><sentence id="1604">And therefore, I think there's a reason why Jews tend to be liberal in their own self interest.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And some of the trends we have th -- do worry me, because we don't seem to be getting our message across as well as we did in former years.</sentence><sentence id="1606">In other words, I'm not -- when -- even when Senator Lieberman mentions God too often, I don't think that's -- that belongs in politics.</sentence><sentence id="1607">Now, one of the things that made things so easy for the Germans is that the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were fun-funded by the state.</sentence><sentence id="1608">In other words, you gave a</sentence><sentence id="1610">58 Interview with Frank Liebermann September 24, 2003 certain part of your taxes to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of your choice.</sentence><sentence id="1611">And therefore, they had complete records of what everybody was and thought, whether they were with them inic -- or against them.</sentence><sentence id="1612">And I therefore don't like some of the trends that we see now in fighting terrorism, of invading civil liberties.</sentence><sentence id="1613">I mean, I certainly don't mind giving my name, but some of the illegal searches and so forth, scare me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
