<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War, in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for about a year so Sov...the <span class="REGION">Czarist Russia</span> and Germans.</sentence><sentence id="30">That <span class="REGION">sector</span>, that section of the of the front, it was manned by the Austrians and it so happened that Hungarians...the Austra-Hungarian empire so there were lots of Hungarians there too, and Germans.</sentence><sentence id="31">Uh when I was about five months old they evacuated us to the rear, the Germans did.</sentence><sentence id="32">The...at that time it was the Hungarian, the Austria-Hungarian army, and we were uh from 1915, beginning of 1916, we were about forty, fifty kilometers in the rear on this of the of the front.</sentence><sentence id="33">There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended, we came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">Uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was almost uh totally demolished and there was nothing to do there, so my father moved to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="35">Uh the Polish government was just established.</sentence><sentence id="36"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became independent in 1918 and my father knowing Polish got a job as the mana...office manager in the Polish uh county county seat.</sentence><sentence id="37">That way he worked for a couple of years till the Poles started settling that that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because there were no Poles, very few Poles there, and they got a lot of Polish-speaking Poles and my father was fired.</sentence><sentence id="38">Uh this was about 1920.</sentence><sentence id="39">At that time the new Soviet army occupied, advanced all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">They went by us and uh it was a very difficult time because there was also many Ukrainian uh independence groups trying to establish an independent <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, and among them were many bands of anti- Semitic uh armies.</sentence><sentence id="41">There was Batura (ph), and there was Bela and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims.</sentence><sentence id="42">The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the , and uh we became, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became a normal so-called democratic country.</sentence><sentence id="43">It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939.</sentence><sentence id="44">Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as being built.</sentence><sentence id="45">Uh my father went into <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough).</sentence><sentence id="47">He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish courts</span> in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> or any other Polish authorities.</sentence><sentence id="48">I grew up uh in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed.</sentence><sentence id="49">I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education.</sentence><sentence id="50">And uh I stayed there for a year or two.</sentence><sentence id="51">I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the moon.</sentence><sentence id="52">That's that's while, you know, didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> or we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there.</sentence><sentence id="53">One day I remember my father went for , went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> which was about six kilometers away and I I was probably four or five years old and I ran after the realize it that he sneaked out I guess.</sentence><sentence id="54">He didn't want...it was expensive to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it.</sentence><sentence id="55">I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">They had to go through a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">There were wolves in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him. (</sentence><sentence id="58">Laughter) So I grew up in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">Then my father went to as I told you before, and he didn't do badly.</sentence><sentence id="60">It was...he had a uh <span class="BUILDING">military garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">The the the terrain around our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was swampy and and lot lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army.</sentence><sentence id="62">Uh my father used to have a uh <span class="BUILDING">beer parlor</span> like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink.</sentence><sentence id="63">He also had a kind of a so-called <span class="BUILDING">department store</span>-like which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us.</sentence><sentence id="64">Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, died, the leader of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very tough.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: we've talked a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">I would like to know about you as a young boy growing up.</sentence><sentence id="103">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go, what.....?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Well, I went, as I told you before, first of all my father taught me.</sentence><sentence id="108">Later on there were others.</sentence><sentence id="109">When he went to <span class="BUILDING">business</span>, there were other teachers.</sentence><sentence id="110">One of them particular influenced my life very greatly.</sentence><sentence id="111">His name was Moshi .</sentence><sentence id="112">He was a modern Hebrew teacher.</sentence><sentence id="113">He taught me everything, you know, all...my my rounded education all in Hebrew, so I learned Hebrew quite well.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh but it was compulsa...this was...this was <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were not recognized by the Polish government.</sentence><sentence id="115">They were uh...we, we ourselves organized them.</sentence><sentence id="116">You know, we used to hire our teacher and this was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, probably about forty Jewish families, so we we were compelled to to attend the <span class="BUILDING">Polish grammar school</span>, which in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> went only to the fourth grade.</sentence><sentence id="117">In bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> it went to the seventh grade.</sentence><sentence id="118">And and and I was very advanced for that kind of education, you see, except in Polish, which I learned, but I mean uh math and all the other subjects I learned already when I was five years old.</sentence><sentence id="119">I had to learn ,SoI1L...I went up through the fourth grade and later on my parents enrolled me into a uh <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which is <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">Uh it was operated by the network of <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span>, Zionist Hebrew...Hebrew language teaching Hebrew uh teaching Hebrew in " which is uh about thirty kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and I stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="121">And again I stayed with a family which was uh very crowded.</sentence><sentence id="122">They had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with four kids and I was with them and my uh mother used to send me every week uh freshly baked , pastry and butter and all this stuff and I managed by myself as so.</sentence><sentence id="123">I entered...I took an exam and entered the third class.</sentence><sentence id="124">This was a uh...well, this was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> up to the eighth...you graduated uh matriculated uh in eight eight classes.</sentence><sentence id="125">I entered in the third, but they were very expensive and at that time my father's business went down and he could not afford to pay and after a year my younger brother was ready to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">He wanted him to get a little bit of education, so I was... went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my younger brother, second brother, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">So my formal education ended there.</sentence><sentence id="128">I still had the same teacher we had before for about a year and a half, till about my thirteenth year, thirteen, fourteen years old and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="129">That that's where my formal education ended.</sentence><sentence id="130">I tried of course all the time to upgrade my education.</sentence><sentence id="131">I I taught myself.</sentence><sentence id="132">I read a lot and this teacher helped me a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="133">Uh at that time it was a very difficult... what do when you are fourteen or fifteen?</sentence><sentence id="134">And we had some, I had friends...well, my age probably we had a group of about ten kids, boys and girls, and we organized a uh group.</sentence><sentence id="135">Originally it was , a leftist Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="136">Later on the majority thought that this was too too leftist for them, and we organized a , which was the revisionist group and then uh there was nothing to do in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so at age sixteen I decided to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">So we went but at that time it was the most famous kibbutz in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="138">It was a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> where we worked.</sentence><sentence id="139">Uh not enough to eat, lots of work and I stayed there for a few months and then one of my friends tried to leave and he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and while going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he stopped in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">He lived a little further and he told my parents about the conditions in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="141">So they decided that I should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">So they wrote me a letter where my mother is very sick (laughter) and I should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="144">Thank God she was not sick and I didn't go back.</sentence><sentence id="145">Besides you had to wait...it was not so much the hard work and the lack of food, but you might have to wait two years, three years, before you get a certificate, you know, to go to...it was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">So what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="147">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="148">There was nothing to do in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so my parents decided to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">My mother had a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">So I went there and my uncle had a little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> but I wasn't interested too much in it.</sentence><sentence id="151">I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="152"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was the industrial capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">Had a great textile industry and Jews were uh dominated the small <span class="BUILDING">textile businesses</span>, uh manufacturing sweaters, uh socks, uh gloves, these kind of...the large <span class="BUILDING">textile mills</span>, even though some of them were owned by Jews, had no Jewish employees.</sentence><sentence id="154">They had non-Jewish employees.</sentence><sentence id="155">It was so- called which was owned by a Jew named Cohen (ph) who was, by the way, a Hasid (ph), a very religious Jew and there was who built great <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> for Polish people, but for the Jews he built a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, for Jews that could not work.</sentence><sentence id="156">There was strong unions there, Polish nationalist unions, even socialist unions were very much against Jews.</sentence><sentence id="157">So it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="158">1 went to __ <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for a few months and I learned making sweaters, and I used to stay there for a few months, earn enough to get a ticket to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> (laughter) for this...you know the season was uh summer.</sentence><sentence id="159">Middle summer and late fall and then there was no work.</sentence><sentence id="160">These were small...people that lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and had a...two or three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>, hand-operated sweater making machines.</sentence><sentence id="161">That's what I did for a few years and uh this was known...you know what means?</sentence><sentence id="162">And that's the way life was till 1939.</sentence><sentence id="163">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in "38 and stayed till 1939.</sentence><sentence id="164">In 1930...by went from , from the extreme right to a leftist organization called the Anti*Fascist Front.</sentence><sentence id="165">I didn't know at that time that it was dominated by the , the communist youth organization.</sentence><sentence id="166">Later on the Communist Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was uh dissolved by Stalin but this group...the the uh the Communist Youth Organization was instructed to infiltrate other organizations, regardless right or left.</sentence><sentence id="167">I didn't....was not exactly uh you know, convinced of communism because I was still, I still had Zionist inclinations.</sentence><sentence id="168">I couldn't understand why Hebrew language which was near and dear to me should be banned, which was banned by the Communist Party.</sentence><sentence id="169">Uh many other <span class="NPIP">things</span> which I could not understand of course at that time.</sentence><sentence id="170">I understand it now.</sentence><sentence id="171">And uh so I joined that group till I find out that they were...this was just a uh arm of the Communist Youth movement so I left them but I had some idea about the Communist uh Marxism, Communism, Leninism, so forth, the way it was then...you know, it changed.</sentence><sentence id="172">Especially lately.</sentence><sentence id="173">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and in 1939 when the Soviet Union occupied this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>...the Germans occupied the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>...I uh became active in the local the uh well cultural Communist uh leadership of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">I got ...as a as a result of this I got the job as the manager of the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q:</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: The Soviet occupation was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="247">We didn't feel it so much in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because there were no no bourgeois, no no people that were sent away but there were Poles that lived around, settlers.</sentence><sentence id="248">They were not native to this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, but <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> settled them there after 1918, 1920.</sentence><sentence id="249">These were participants in the Polish war for independence, in the lst World War, and they awarded...they gave them parcels of <span class="REGION">land</span> to to work and there were they were called colonies.</sentence><sentence id="250">They were not called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">They were called <span class="REGION">Polish colonies</span> and one night they called me and , cold...it was a very cold winter in 1939-40.</sentence><sentence id="252">They called us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> uh , well the the uh the local the local the local authorities and uh I saw a lot of

id="255">They called them all .</sentence><sentence id="256">They were sitting there was a some people from the NKBD in charge of this and they told us...uh first of all they screened everyone of us and said can you, can you spend the night, can you spend the morning and so forth, and when they came to me I told them I can't...I have to be in the morning in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> because I have to distribute bread and there was...aga...again a <span class="BUILDING">military garrison</span> there which we supplied with bread, their families would buy bread, and [had to be there in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="257">I I smelled there was something wrong there.</sentence><sentence id="258">I didn't know what.</sentence><sentence id="259">In the morning when I woke up I saw hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> taking away these Polish families from all around, from the whole <span class="REGION">region</span>, uh loading them into into uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">Uh they had, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> to heat...not like the German.</sentence><sentence id="261">By by the way, I think that Hitler learned from Stalin how to how to do these things.</sentence><sentence id="262">Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, ___ but originally it was tough.</sentence><sentence id="263">And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our <span class="REGION">region</span>, Poles, and sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">Also some of the former Communist leaders were arrested and you know, it was kind of uh the same thing I think that is going on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">They they...( ) I know, but but there is there is a common thread there.</sentence><sentence id="266">Uh whoever had some grudge against somebody else, they denounced them and they were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="267">I know a very good friend of mine was...a Ukrainian, not a Jew, Ukrainian...leader of the , Spent probably about four or five years in Polish jails for being a Communist.</sentence><sentence id="268">The Communist Party was illegal in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and he was sent away to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, together with these Poles, the same night.</sentence><sentence id="269">But we didn't have...there weren't very many rich Jews in <span

was bearable to live.</sentence><sentence id="289">To us it was...I even believed some of their slogans, see, about uh rights of minorities, because the left persecuted the Jews, Jews couldn't a job.</sentence><sentence id="290">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="291">And the Polish uh from 1920 till 1939 uh there wasn't a single Jewish
