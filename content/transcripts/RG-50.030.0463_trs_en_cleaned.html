<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: How does one get the -- the leather?</sentence><sentence id="123">The -- the skins?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: I'd say it's a very complex process.</sentence><sentence id="130">You start the -- actually, leather is a -- they're two separate words.</sentence><sentence id="131">We start out with the hide, and when we say hide, we mean a skin of an animal beginning from the time when it's removed from the carcass up til the tissues are saturated with some chemical that will stop it from deteriorating or rotting.</sentence><sentence id="132">That means -- we call it a hide.</sentence><sentence id="133">That part of process -- and i -- it's a -- it's a length -- it takes even today with modern methods, it takes anywhere from four to six weeks to process a hide into a finished product.</sentence><sentence id="134">And the reason I say today because in 1946 - "47, I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">leather tannery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, for two years.</sentence><sentence id="135">And the process was virtually identical.</sentence><sentence id="136">Matter of fact, the machine I worked, I -- I was assigned to, the particular machine, was identical with the machine that we had back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, there was virtually no difference.</sentence><sentence id="137">The same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>, same thing, same way, same method.</sentence><sentence id="138">So, ou call a hide all the way up to the tanning process.</sentence><sentence id="139">The minute it's tanned, that means the tissues are permeated with some chemical, from then on it's leather.</sentence><sentence id="140">And all consecutive stages of it, we talk in terms of leather.</sentence><sentence id="141">The <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> was my <span class="DLF">playground</span> because there were only the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> resided in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">And as you went out to the peripheries, there were less and less Jews.</sentence><sentence id="143">The peripheries were populated by blue collar Gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="144">Especially that the native Poles were a minority in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> had close to a million population, something like 800,000.There was about 250,000 Jews, about a hun -- 200,000 native Germans, which was termed in German the Volksdeutsch.</sentence><sentence id="146">So the Poles were really a minority.</sentence><sentence id="147">They were hi -- and there were <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, when we talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, where -- <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> where the only Gentile was the janitor.</sentence><sentence id="148">The entire <span class="BUILDING">apartment house complex</span> was part -- occupied by Jewish families.</sentence><sentence id="149">For instance, the friend of mine with whom I'm staying right now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> he lived on <span class="BUILDING">Piotkowska 20</span>, which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">And it was a gigantic <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, two <span class="DLF">courtyards</span>, house at least six, 800 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">And the only Pole was the janitor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: And was this typical of the way in which the groups lived, that there was mostly separation between the groups?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Yes, yes, very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: So you had no Gentile friends, or [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Well, well, in my case, there were on the -- to the best of my memory, I lived on a dead end -- you know, it would help us, you have that map, it'll be a great help if we could kind of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: This is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: No, this is the -- this is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Oh, that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="193">Now keep in mind, I didn't make that for you, this is a --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Right, right, this is --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Matter of fact, this is part of a collage.</sentence><sentence id="196">This is one half of a <span class="BUILDING">collage</span> that I made for my children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: So this is where the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> was [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Right, this is the -- this was the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span>, and this is the <span class="DLF">ghetto boundary</span>, the future <span class="DLF">ghetto boundary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">The Jews really occupied densely, the <span class="REGION">area</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Balloot mart</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">market</span> -- going this way, which would be -- this map is very wrong.</sentence><sentence id="202">This is north, okay?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Right, right, so going north.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Going north.</sentence><sentence id="206">The center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was the s -- [indecipherable] is <span class="DLF">Freedom Square</span> [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="207">And that -- the densely populate -- the poorer Jews lived between Belt mark -- <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and that's [indecipherable] more or less here.</sentence><sentence id="208">That -- that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balotte</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balote</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">This is the old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And the new part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was centered more or less around <span class="BUILDING">Pietma Center Piotkowska</span> with all -- the sizes are not shown, this densely [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: And this was all Jewish populated.</sentence><sentence id="225">So you see us who come out here, that was very scarce.</sentence><sentence id="226">This little <span class="DLF">street</span> -- we -- I live on a dead end <span class="DLF">street</span>, and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">factory compound</span> was actually closing the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="231">And how do you pronounce that?</sentence><sentence id="232">Quid --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kwizinska</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kwizinska</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
