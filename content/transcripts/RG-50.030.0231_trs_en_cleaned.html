walking about maybe a half an hour, suddenly from the first <span class="DLF">line</span>...from the first <span class="DLF">line</span>, we heard that we are turning in on left.</sentence><sentence id="321">Turning in, not going straight because I don't know, but people knew where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="322">This is a different, total different
