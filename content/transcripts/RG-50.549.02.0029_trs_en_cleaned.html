<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Okay, now, Dr. Chameides, | -- I'd like to start a little bit -- just before the period that we -- we were planning to begin.</sentence><sentence id="8">Just at those -- those last days that you recall before liberation.</sentence><sentence id="9">Did you have an anticipation that something was -- was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="10">What -- Do you recall what your feelings were at thas -- that time just before -- just before liberation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: I think, first of all, I have to emphasize the fact that in 1944, I was nine years old.</sentence><sentence id="16">And I had been away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a little over two years, since August of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="17">And if you remember your feelings at nine years of age, it's very difficult to separate out, and to recall exactly what one's feelings were at that time and what occurred later and I'm very - - always very careful not to read in things that occurred later and attribute them to that time.</sentence><sentence id="18">I was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> by the name of Univ, which is near the large city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, now in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Univ</span> was very close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzyce</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">But I was hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>, the Univ <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was the mother monastery of the stunite</sentence><sentence id="22"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 3 monks of the <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian Catholic Church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">I was, by that time, a Greek Catholic in my -- in my approach really, but with fairly vivid feelings and recollections of being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="24">And we, of course, knew that things were happening, because the front was coming closer and closer to us.</sentence><sentence id="25">There were the tremendous amount of warfare.</sentence><sentence id="26">The Ukrainian partisans were fighting on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> and then saw that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was going to lose and there was a lot of confusion.</sentence><sentence id="27">So a lot of the village people were involved in the fighting, and the fighting -- the front came close and closer to us.</sentence><sentence id="28">We could hear it, we could see it's effects.</sentence><sentence id="29">I'm not sure that I had any feeling in terms of that I was going to be liberated.</sentence><sentence id="30">It was -- There was a certain amount of excitement in the -- in a war coming, but of course we had been through this so many times before, that the issue then was primarily how to survive and how to get the next meal.</sentence><sentence id="31">I think those were much more of immediate concern to us -- or to me, at least, than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="32">For reasons I'm not clear, we had one healer, I don't know whether he was a physician or not, but one person who knew something about medicine in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, that I managed to become his helper at the ripe age of nine and we set up a -- a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and we brought in -- the wounded were brought in from the -- and one of my jobs -- course, we had no medicines at all, and one of my jobs was after the battles, to run into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and to rummage around, find dead soldiers, particularly if they were German, because they would usually have bandages and first aid material on them, and get as much of that material as possible.</sentence><sentence id="33">If they were bandaged -- their wounds were bandaged, I would take the wou -- bandages off and then run back and wash them, so we could use them on the -- on the</sentence><sentence id="35"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 4 Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="36">This helped me a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="37">It taught me a lot and also, it -- it helped me because on Sundays, the farmers, the families would come and then -- and they would -- to see their husbands and youngsters and -- and I would always be around and so I would get eggs and cheese and milk and so there was food.</sentence><sentence id="38">So, we knew something was coming, the front was coming closer to us, the bombardments were more common.</sentence><sentence id="39">One heard a lot of shooting a-around and so we knew something big was -- was about to happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="68">And then, a-a-appreciating the fact that you were nine and that you're not going -- going to recall, of course, all the details or even, you know, looking back at -- those number of years to exactly what you were feeling at the time, and appreciating that fact that you don't want to reconstruct something, as you just said, what do you recall about those actual first moments of realizing that something was really changing now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Well, unfortunately for us, again, in my position, not that much changed, because when the Russians entered, I was on the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span>, because almost as soon as the Russians entered, which as I recall was in June of 1944, Stalin, as you recall, was a firm opponent of the Greek Catholic Church.</sentence><sentence id="72">The <span class="BUILDING">Greek Catholic Church</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">nationalist church</span>, it was very much bound up with Ukrainian nationalism and with a drive for independence on the part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, from the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="73">And so Stalin, who eventually outlawed the <span class="BUILDING">Greek Catholic Church</span>, imme -- almost immediately began persecuting the priests.</sentence><sentence id="74">And so, we would see now, instead of Jews being shot, we would see priests being shot.</sentence><sentence id="75">And so, one day, I had heard that there was a -- a horse drawn</sentence><sentence id="77">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 5 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> going to be going to the big city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and I felt that I had to get out of Univ and so I took one of the younger boys, who is now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">His name now is Oded Amarand, but at that time, his name was Dodo, and we decided we would walk to this nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- I have no i-idea of how much of a distance that was, in order to try to get this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, and on the way, we were stopped by Russian soldiers a-and a Russian patrol stopped us.</sentence><sentence id="79">And children were very often used as spies, so we were highly suspect.</sentence><sentence id="80">And I remember sitting in, behind a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span>, crouched with my arms up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> as this Russian was standing in front of us, not knowing -- with a tommy gun -- not knowing what to do.</sentence><sentence id="81">And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I talked them into allowing us to go to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and -- which he did, and eventually he let us go back to <span class="BUILDING">Univ</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">A- And then, it was I think several weeks before another horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> was going -- this time I think from <span class="BUILDING">Univ</span>, if I recall correctly, and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, which is a ridiculously small distance when covered by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, but is incredibly lengthy by horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">And I was able to get on that and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">mother church</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Santa Yura</span> -- which is the Ukrainian for Saint George, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">And it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Yura</span>, and I don't know how long I was there at this time, I don't get the impression it was a long time, but I really don't have a good concept of time, it could have been weeks, or might have been months, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="85">But i-it was during the morning mass that I remember, which was celebrated by Brat Yosef, Brother Joseph was his name, I remember the way he looked, a bald head with a white beard.</sentence><sentence id="86">And he was celebrating the mass and in the middle of the mass, in walked two boys who were dressed differently than I was.</sentence><sentence id="87">But the dress and</sentence><sentence id="89"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 6 their faces were familiar to me, but I wasn't sure from where.</sentence><sentence id="90">I was dressed at the time in pants made of burlap, because we had nothing, and shoes made of -- of wood, soles made of wood, because there was no leather.</sentence><sentence id="91">And here come these two boys, who are already better dressed.</sentence><sentence id="92">They're in short pants, in a western style, better material.</sentence><sentence id="93">And that was -- one of the boys was my brother and the other one was a young man who is now a chemist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">And they motioned to me and -- and I went with them and I remember going to have something to eat first, because we didn't eat before mass and so we had something to eat and -- and they took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">So -- So that's how I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: When did you realize that that was your brother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: | -- I think -- I think I realized almost immediately, but I wasn't a hundred percent certain.</sentence><sentence id="128">I hadn't seen him in a -- two and a half years and at that age, there's a big change that occurs in -- in people.</sentence><sentence id="129">But I -- I think I realized almost immediately that it was.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="130">Cause I had thought about him a great deal while I was in hiding and the -- the Studite monks made a tremendous effort to always keep us separated, because they were afraid that if we were ever together, we would not only give each other away, but they were in mortal danger themselves, because they were really -- would -- would have been killed had it been known they were hiding Jews.</sentence><sentence id="131">So -- And I remember once, I was in <span class="BUILDING">Univ</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I found a pair of pants that I was absolutely certain were his and that were hidden there, but I'm -- I'm not sure the --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="136"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Do you recall when you finally realized and when you did, you know, connect with him?</sentence><sentence id="138">Do you -- Do you -- Do you remember?</sentence><sentence id="139">Was it -- Was it sa -- Was there enough tension so that the -- the reunion wasn't particularly joyful at the -- at that moment or d- do you recall?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: You know, I don't, and I honestly don't remember emotions very well and -- and again, you know, we had been through so many eventful days and so many eventful months and years, that it seemed like I was almost numb and that nothing surprised me, so here it is.</sentence><sentence id="141">I mean, I -- I don't -- unless I don't remember correctly, which is also possible, but I do not recall a particularly strong emotion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: That makes me wonder whether, I mean, especially with children and you see children nowadays in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>, for example, whether they -- di-di-did you have an idea that this was not normal, what you were going through, or did you just think this is what hap -- not that you would have consciously thought, but did -- do you recall if you would have thought, "This is not normal, this is not supposed to be happening?"</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: 1 -- I don't think I had -- I don't think I had sophisticated thoughts of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="146">I -- I think clearly, you know, at -- at least at the very beginning, I missed my parents tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="147">I was terribly scared a good portion of the time.</sentence><sentence id="148">But -- But the immediate things were hunger, were -- were loneliness, were trying to make sure that one didn't give oneself away by either saying one was Jewish -- we were particularly marked because it - - we were in a society where only Jews were circumcised, so I was always -- I had to be very, very careful, never go -- to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> when other boys were there, never to</sentence></p></dialogue>

[</sentence><sentence id="161">sneezes]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Bless you.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Excuse me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: So, what you're describing, in terms of -- whereas for some people in -- in other parts of Europe, there -- there was a liberation, there was a sense that, you know, this chapter is over.</sentence><sentence id="166">But in -- What you're describing is -- is at least up -- up through parts of 1946, exchanged one oppressor for another, such --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, not through "46, because this was -- we did not stay under the Russians til "46, so -- so th -- what I'm describing now, is the immediate liberation by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="168">And again, you know, I think every person, of course, is different and -- and adapts differently, but also, I think the age makes a big difference.</sentence><sentence id="169">I notice, for instance, people who were just a few years older than I, had different reactions than I did, because they -- I think you develop a sense of perspective and -- and -- and knowledge of the world, which, I think at the age of seven, or even nine, y-you just don't have.</sentence><sentence id="170">So, y-you have a different, you know -- you may develop the skills for survival and the skills for turning</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="177">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 9 yourself into someone else and pretending to be someone else, but -- but -- but you can't put that into a perspective.</sentence><sentence id="178">So, I mean, to me it was very confusing, because my native language, my mother tongue was German.</sentence><sentence id="179">And -- And as I was a youngster, that was the height of culture.</sentence><sentence id="180">So -- So wh-when the German invasion came in, I thought this was great.</sentence><sentence id="181">Now, I'll be able to speak my language.</sentence><sentence id="182">So, you know, I was naive, I didn't know anything about the persecutions which had already -- I didn't know much about Hitler or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="183">I was in a different age frame and I had a different, you know, perspective on it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: I guess the reason I -- I mentioned "46 was not necessarily that it was going to be continuous oppression for you, but the events of -- I guess it was June "46, and the rampages in -- was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kilsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Well, I was already out of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> by that time.</sentence><sentence id="201">We, just to go back a little bit, after I was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>, we went to -- the person who was responsible for even knowing that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> was Rabbi David Kahana, who became the chief Rabbi of the Polish army.</sentence><sentence id="202">And he himself and his wife and two children were hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">He as a priest, his wife as a nun.</sentence><sentence id="204">He wrote a book called, "The Lvov Ghetto Diary."</sentence><sentence id="205">And he was a -- He was good friends with my father.</sentence><sentence id="206">And, in fact, the two of them went to metropolish -- metropolithishipditsky together, which eventually led to th -- him hiding us.</sentence><sentence id="207">So, he knew of our whereabouts.</sentence><sentence id="208">He also knew that our parents</sentence></p><p><sentence id="211"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 10 didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="212">And so he made it his business to make sure that we were taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>, whereas, as you know, there were children, including a good friend of mine who was with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Univ</span>, whose parents not survive, who simply no one knew that they were there and they were just left there, and then became the object of a lot of post-war court cases for the community to try to get some of these children back.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, we went with my brother and -- and Nathan, who was the other boy, to Rabbi Kahana, and Rabbi Kahana told us at that point that our parents had perished and he had a -- a little note that my mother had written, which she gave to him for safekeeping, which he gave us.</sentence><sentence id="214">And then the question was, "Do you know what to do with us?"</sentence><sentence id="215">I was nine, my brother was 11 and a half and my brother had been placed with a family who had survived the war and there was a husband, wife and the young son of his age and they were willing to take him in.</sentence><sentence id="216">And they knew of a woman by the name of Tolla Wasserman -- her maiden name was Ashkenazi, who had been born in 1909, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and who had gone through the war, was hidden by her maid, she had a Polish maid who was able to cordon off one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, very much like Anne Frank's thing, and they remained there for 18 months.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">And so she was the only one in the family who survived, she was alone and Mr. and Mrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="218">Frost, who were the people that my brother was staying with -- and went to her and asked her whether she would be willing to take me in, and she did.</sentence><sentence id="219">My brother did not remain with the Frosts, he -- he had a lot of difficulty in becoming a part of any new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at all, and -- and left, but I remained with -- with Tolla Wasserman from 1944, I believe</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="223">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0029 11 November, until her death in 1964.</sentence><sentence id="224">And, it was really, I think a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="225">I think, thanks to her that Iam where I am.</sentence><sentence id="226">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Why do you think that -- wa-was it the age difference th-that made it so difficult for your brother, whereas it was possible for you to adapt, even thought it's only two and a half years?</sentence><sentence id="228">Perhaps a significant time.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="230">You know, one of the difficulties we always have in -- in trying to ascribe any reasons for anything, is that we have no controls.</sentence><sentence id="231">And I don't know what would have happened to me had I been his age.</sentence><sentence id="232">I think part of it was age, but I don't think it was all age.</sentence><sentence id="233">I think I have had, since then, and -- and before, a tremendous ability to adapt to reality, which served me well, so I think part of it may have been age, but I don't think all of it.</sentence><sentence id="234">I think part of it has to do with personality.</sentence></p></dialogue>

would go to, one of my rituals was to go to the phone book and look at the name of Amirand, and it's an unusual name, and I never found it.</sentence><sentence id="1602">A few years ago, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, and I had previously looked in the Jerusalem book, but I had not looked in the Tel Aviv book.</sentence><sentence id="1603">And I was in <span

made up to go to dinner the following evening</sentence><sentence id="1612"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0029 57 and came to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">north Tel Aviv</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">And his wife, while I was there, said to him, "You know, I've tried your Uncle Adolph several times today and there's no answer and I'm worried about him."</sentence><sentence id="1614">So he said, "Well, let's go out to dinner, we have reservations and after dinner, I will go and I will check up on him, make

"Why don't you give me the key and let me go in first?</sentence><sentence id="1622">I don't have a good feeling about this."</sentence><sentence id="1623">And I opened the <span

dinner and we talked about things and so on, we were both trying to remember the name of the third young man.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Both of us remembered him, because we had his picture, but

id="1638">Do you know anyone who would fit that?"</sentence><sentence id="1639">And he said, "Of course, that's Daniel Rottfeld, he lives two blocks down, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1640">Well, Daniel Adam Rottfeld was in fact the third boy.</sentence><sentence id="1641">He was, at that time, afraid to write me, because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was still Communist, so he got in touch with an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and suddenly I got a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, telling me about him and the fact that he very much would like to be in touch with me, but that he can't, and the reason he can't is that he works -- worked at that time for the foreign ministry.</sentence><sentence id="1642">Now, eventually, when the Iron Curtain fell and so on, and we could exchange letters, it turned out that Daniel was left in the <span
