<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell us about the family which you grew up in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Our family was a normal, or what you might call a "normal family."</sentence><sentence id="20">My father was a tailor.</sentence><sentence id="21">They were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">My parents were -- came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> right after the first World War, married in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and there were three children in the family.</sentence><sentence id="23">There would have been a fourth, but that child, a boy, died six weeks after birth.</sentence><sentence id="24">I was the oldest.</sentence><sentence id="25">My sister was a year and a half younger, and the other one, born in 1928, was seven years younger.</sentence><sentence id="26">A normal family, as I said, with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and activities, fun -- although some of that was disrupted by the death of my father in 1930.</sentence><sentence id="27">I was nine years old, the oldest at the time of the three children.</sentence><sentence id="28">And, my mother, a young widow at 35, never remarried.</sentence><sentence id="29">My father was 39.</sentence><sentence id="30">And it sort of made me a father image, young as I was, to my children -- to my sisters -- because my mother had to go to work and support the young family.</sentence><sentence id="31">But that was all bearable and we coped as best we could.</sentence><sentence id="32">We do not want to forget that in those years it was still, if not depression, but very close to just, just post-depression.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Tell us about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: And these were hard times.</sentence><sentence id="50">Just as here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the middle "30s, latter "30s, we had to make with -- make ends meet with what was available to us.</sentence><sentence id="51">And income -- my mother was a, as I said, a widow who had to come up with, with the support of the family, and there were Jewish organizations who helped out in that respect.</sentence><sentence id="52">And the real, the real tragedy began then in 1938 with the annexation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">Where that family structure, that family entity as in so many hundreds and thousands and millions of cases, that family entity overnight was destroyed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Tell us about -- before you begin with 1938, tell me about a Jewish child growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="60">Were you aware of being a Jew, and what did that mean as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had a history of antisemitic activities and antisemitic attitudes.</sentence><sentence id="64">When we grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, as Jews, we were always aware of the fact that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="65">It so happens that I lived in a district in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> where there were more Jews than in other <span class="REGION">districts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">It was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">20th district</span>, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span> had more Jews than the 20th, and a few other <span class="REGION">districts</span> had -- but the majority of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> were non-Jewish or very few Jews and antisemitism was almost a part of daily life.</sentence><sentence id="67">It's not that we thought a lot about it, because it just became part of life.</sentence><sentence id="68">If you, if you, if you live with something everyday, then it becomes part of you and you cope with it, if it didn't become too violent.</sentence><sentence id="69">But from time to time, there were denigrations.</sentence><sentence id="70">Sometime we were spit at.</sentence><sentence id="71">Sometime we were singled out for a particular rough treatments in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, the Easter and Christmas seasons particularly.</sentence><sentence id="72">When I think back to those days, to me they represent a certain trauma because we, we were set apart.</sentence><sentence id="73">There was Easter dealing with a religious connotation of Christ and the resurrection which automatically brings back the killing of Christ, and that was the Jewish misdeed.</sentence><sentence id="74">And at Christmas time it was -- again we, we couldn't, we couldn't be part of a, of a festive mood even if we wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="75">Oh, there were many times when we did participate with neighbors in trimming a tree or sharing in, in the Christmas cookies and that sort of thing, but that was all surface.</sentence><sentence id="76">As children, we did things like this because we were part of a, of a, of a greater community where there were non-Jewish children and we, we related to them.</sentence><sentence id="77">But the excesses took place at certain times for certain reasons and especially during the depression years.</sentence><sentence id="78">I was then in my early young years, but I do remember that often could we hear that all these economic problems -- and even the first World War -- it was all the fault of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="79">So we were being maligned and singled out and we didn't like it, but nevertheless we asserted ourselves in some way because when, when we went on outings with the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span>, we, we sometime carried the Jewish blue and white flag and we were taunted for that by people who were looking at us.</sentence><sentence id="80">But it was a segment in history that does not reflect too well on, on the Austrian attitude towards Jews, and when we go later into "38, it is very easily perceptible.</sentence><sentence id="81">You can touch it.</sentence><sentence id="82">You can feel it.</sentence><sentence id="83">You could see it, that as soon as the Austrian Anschluss" took place, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in the next five, six weeks, or perhaps several months, the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> underwent much more hardship in those few weeks or months than the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did in the previous five years from "33 to "38.</sentence><sentence id="84">It lent itself -- the climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> lent itself more to antisemitic excesses.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: Give us examples.</sentence><sentence id="108">It's 1938, you have described a really dramatic change in your feelings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="111">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="112">What happened to Leo Bretholz?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Seeing that some of my uncles had been arrested and many of our friends and neighbors had been arrested, my mother actually urged me to think of leaving as soon as I possibly could -- " Term used to described the incorporation of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in the German Reich on March 11, 1938.</sentence><sentence id="114">leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">I had already left <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And an aunt of mine had left for <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> right after the Anschluss, and we planned for me to join that aunt and her husband, my uncle, in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> as soon as I would be able to -- as soon as arrangements could be made.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was my mother who prevailed upon me to leave because she said that for boys and for men, it will be very bad, as we can see.</sentence><sentence id="118">People were arrested every day and within days or the most a few weeks, ashes were sent back of these people to their, to their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="119">Now whether they were these peoples ashes or not, nobody could ever find out.</sentence><sentence id="120">But they received a container with ashes, describing them as the ashes of the deceased who was caught trying to escape and shot because shooting was a justification for, for catching someone who tried to escape, killing someone, or that he had contracted a disease, a pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="121">But there were these, these explanations given which no one hardly even believed because some of the people who were freed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> periodically brought back other horror stories, so we know that.</sentence><sentence id="122">My mother was very much bent on sending me away, and frankly, it is constantly a source of guilt for me, to know that she had sent me away and they couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="123">But then when I consulted with psychiatrist, because I didn't want to have to live with feelings such as these, he confirmed to me that, "Would your mother be able to speak today, she would still say...she was glad she did it."</sentence><sentence id="124">So, to begin with, she was actually instrumental in getting me out and saving my life.</sentence><sentence id="125">She was a good woman.</sentence><sentence id="126">My mother was what you might call in, in Hebrew, it's described as "Eshet Khayil,"" -- woman of valor.</sentence><sentence id="127">She did the best she could under the circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="128">I am breaking down because...she never had a chance in life... She and my sisters and 55 others of my family never had a chance in life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: What did she do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: She was a widow and had to struggle to support the family and always helped poor people, people that were less well-off than we or less fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="148">Always helped somebody.</sentence><sentence id="149">There was this poor painter around the corner from us.</sentence><sentence id="150">When the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> needed painting, she called him.</sentence><sentence id="151">He didn't even do a good job, but he needs the job.</sentence><sentence id="152">And when it was finished, the painting wasn't -- the painted <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was sort of streaky, but she had given Mr. Fried a job because he needed it for his family, you see.</sentence><sentence id="153">But, I got to get myself together to make this thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Let's pull it back.</sentence><sentence id="162">Pull it back.</sentence><sentence id="163">Your mother...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: She urged me to leave, and I did leave.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koblenz</span>, to the west of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span>, the ancient <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">By arrangement with a committee in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>; it was called the Ezra &gt; Woman of valor (Hebrew).</sentence><sentence id="173">Committee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Who were the Ezra Committee?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: The Ezra was an aid committee, almost like a HIAS," perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="180">Aid to refugees that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, provide some shelter, provide food, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and help these people who could not stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> unless they had regularized, temporary documents.</sentence><sentence id="181">Somebody came with a passport and a, and a, and a visa could do that.</sentence><sentence id="182">Others that fled and came illegally, could not.</sentence><sentence id="183">And the Ezra committee was such a committee.</sentence><sentence id="184">And a Mr. Becker who was the smuggler that smuggled me across from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, was in the employ of Ezra.</sentence><sentence id="185">In a way because later when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, he was also the one that smuggled us into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, but I am jumping ahead here.</sentence><sentence id="186">But we were -- I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span>, and on the 31st of October, Mr. Becker picked me up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> and smuggled me across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">Actually he took me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sauer River</span> and asked me cross and then meet him at the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Sauer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">And during the night from October 31st to November the first, after it had been raining for four or five days in <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> -- these are the rainy periods there -- I crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">He had asked me to put a pair of dry socks into my coat pocket so that when I came across and once I had crossed, I would put these dry socks on, which at the point was not even possible because I didn't have dry socks in my pocket after I had crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">When he told me I was to cross that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, I asked him would I -- no, he asked me do I know how to swim.</sentence><sentence id="191">I said, "Yes, I know how to swim."</sentence><sentence id="192">I said, "Would it be necessary, you think?"</sentence><sentence id="193">because he told me I would wade across.</sentence><sentence id="194">But no way could I wade across that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> after four days of rain because that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> carried a lot of torrential waters with debris, branches, mud, all kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="195">That <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> springs in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ardenne Mountains</span> and comes down.</sentence><sentence id="196">It's a, it's really a tributary of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Moselle</span>, a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which under normal circumstances is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span>, a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">I went there later in years with, with my family to get to that same <span class="REGION">area</span>, and people were just waiting there ankle deep, knee deep in that particular... But I crossed, and the first step I took into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, I was up to my knees and the second step up to my chest, and then here go the dry socks in my pocket, and it wasn't a concern of mine.</sentence><sentence id="198">My concern was to get across.</sentence><sentence id="199">And I did!</sentence><sentence id="200">And on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, Mr. Becker was waiting to take me into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and my aunt was waiting there, and I had crossed into safety.</sentence><sentence id="201">Or at the moment, relative safety, because three days later, I was arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">The police came into this <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> where I was sitting and having breakfast just a couple of days after I had crossed.</sentence><sentence id="203">Actually, my coat was still wet and not even dried yet, and they asked for my papers and I didn't have them, so they arrested me and took me to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and I spent the night in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Luxembourg jail</span> -- by the way, a very clean <span class="BUILDING">facility</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">And the next morning, they interrogated me.</sentence><sentence id="205">How did I come over?</sentence><sentence id="206">I said, "I crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">The river Sauer."

found out about.</sentence><sentence id="361">And from November "38 to May 1940, I spent 18 months in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, which were pleasant months with distant relatives and friends, constantly under the pressure of not being sent -- avoiding to be sent to a camp because they also had camps for these refugees.</sentence><sentence id="362">Somebody working in that committee, also a Viennese fellow who worked there in, in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> helping out with paperwork made sure that when the time came to select people for the <span

course in electrotechnical, studies, you know, was a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">Took also languages and I learned Flemish almost, almost to

why I was in this <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">With my distant relatives in 1939, I went for a week's vacation to the <span

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, I as a Viennese-born person could not be an Austrian until I would have been 21 years old with the first military service.</sentence><sentence

a few times, and then you have just the bars to contend with.</sentence><sentence id="2109">But that <span class="DLF">window</span> was not in our plan, because that was the <span

getaway.</sentence><sentence id="2114">And as soon as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, we had all night to think about that.</sentence><sentence id="2115">We were walking in, in, around in miserable conditions.</sentence><sentence id="2116">I mean, we were sliding back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="2117">So the only way we tried in the morning to move these <span class="DLF">bars</span>, but it wasn't possible.</sentence><sentence id="2118">We decided the only way that we could possibly do that is by trying to twist them or to bend them forcefully or forcibly.</sentence><sentence id="2119">And we dunked, we took our sweaters and we dunked them in human wastes, made them wet, to create a tensile cloth.</sentence><sentence id="2120">Dry cloth you cannot wring too well.</sentence><sentence id="2121">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">towel</span>, for instance.</sentence><sentence id="2122">But a wet cloth can be wrung and wrung and wrung, and it twists and twists until the moisture has dripped out entirely until it's dry.</sentence><sentence id="2123">That sort of principle is applied in a tourniquet style when you use it on an arm.</sentence><sentence id="2124">We used that as a tourniquet.</sentence><sentence id="2125">So if you figure that two <span class="DLF">bars</span>, you twist that sweater around the <span

was no give yet.</sentence><sentence id="2128">There was no give yet.</sentence><sentence id="2129">But we hoped that something will happen.</sentence><sentence id="2130">And then we moved in the <span class="NPIP">side</span> and see maybe it gets loose a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2131">But after a while, when we twisted again, again, we gave up for five minutes to catch our breath and we were perspiring.</sentence><sentence id="2132">We were working under pressure.</sentence><sentence id="2133">This was our getaway.</sentence><sentence id="2134">This was life.</sentence><sentence id="2135">There the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> flew by us, that bucolic countryside -- <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the <span

id="2143">And we twisted and twisted, and then finally we saw that glimmer of hope where the bars in the frame started to move ever so slightly, ever so slightly.</sentence><sentence id="2144">And rust came out falling from that fitting that it was in, the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that it is set in.</sentence><sentence id="2145">Rust came out.</sentence><sentence id="2146">Now, we never hoped to get the bar out of there; because they are set in like an inch or so, half an inch.</sentence><sentence id="2147">But we hoped to, them to be bending.</sentence><sentence id="2148">We worked for a while, and we saw them ever so slightly bend inward.</sentence><sentence id="2149">Then we used our hands to move them apart again, so that they should start loosening.</sentence><sentence id="2150">And it did that!</sentence><sentence id="2151">We moved them back into the proper <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2152">We went back and twisted again and this time, the bending inward was ever so slightly more of a bend.</sentence><sentence id="2153">And we put that again, did that.</sentence><sentence id="2154">We worked all day, being mindful of the fact that if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would have to come to a stop, these things would have to be put into proper position.</sentence><sentence id="2155">Because then the guards would walk out of the first and the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2156">They were in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>--that was a <span

bars had moved apart, through our efforts, enough where we could see our way squeezing through it.</sentence><sentence id="2162">And we put them back into the original position, just again in case the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would come to a stop and the guards would come up and inspect.</sentence><sentence id="2163">One time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and the people there seeing it wanted to reach me.</sentence><sentence id="2164">We shouted "Water!"</sentence><sentence id="2165">The -- they didn't let them get close because these people were aware of three transports going by there every week.</sentence><sentence id="2166">Some of the people were aware of that, and sometimes that awareness helped communicate simply because some of us.</sentence><sentence id="2167">And I didn't do it, because I didn't leave family and friends.</sentence><sentence id="2168">But some of them, husbands or wives or

one stop.</sentence><sentence id="2175">In hindsight, I see exactly the time when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- because it's in the book - - when the <span

to the <span class="DLF">roof</span>, holding on to this, and stepping on those.</sentence><sentence id="2182">I was already half free.</sentence><sentence id="2183">I was standing there reaching my

because at that very moment or just seconds later, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went into a slight curve on the north side.</sentence><sentence id="2189">That's the side we intended to jump.</sentence><sentence id="2190">And the curve is like a concave curve, which serves the guards as a means to inspect the whole length of the <span

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, is still under control.</sentence><sentence id="2192">It is possible that they noticed that, because at that moment when the <span

case.</sentence><sentence id="2199">Or they may have caught him.</sentence><sentence id="2200">Those shots, however, were fired before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a halt,

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3397">A: The group was composed of a microcosm of, of people who were resisting the Germans or the fascist regimes.</sentence><sentence id="3398">There were

some way.</sentence><sentence id="3404">Well, a couple of them then ran away and joined with the French underground because they were really against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3405">There were some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span>, who traditionally were either violently anti-German or very much with the Germans from their nationalistic point of view.</sentence><sentence id="3406">But there were many Alsace-Lorraine citizens who were deeply nationalistic French.</sentence><sentence id="3407">These people resisted the Germans just as well.</sentence><sentence id="3408">And there were a few of those in the -- in that group, and a lot of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3409">What was that group?</sentence><sentence id="3410">It was really a group called the, the Vichy French had a youth movement which was called Companion de France.</sentence><sentence id="3411">These people were prepared -- young people from age 17 on -- were doing crafts and, and trades.</sentence><sentence id="3412">Learning crafts and trades, like masonry and carpentry and plumbing and <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and that sort of thing, to prepare them for service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the new order, to be incorporated into the new order.</sentence><sentence id="3413">This was a Petain youth movement called

songs in training.</sentence><sentence id="3417">This group took on the semblance of a Companion de France camp.</sentence><sentence id="3418">When we -- when I presented myself to the camp chief -- Chief of Camp, "Chief de Camp," Maurice Bardin -- B-A-R-D-I-N -- I showed him a note that I had from my friend, showed him the birth certificate, he did not ask me any questions.</sentence><sentence

you."</sentence><sentence id="3422">And they made out the ID for us, and I was accepted as one of the, of the group.</sentence><sentence id="3423">This group was mainly engaged in sending messages.</sentence><sentence id="3424">Messages from the mountains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Savoy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span>, or sending emissaries up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> with certain instructions as to what to do when the next German column comes by.</sentence><sentence id="3425">But on the surface, ostensibly, we were learning carpentry and agriculture.</sentence><sentence id="3426">And in the morning, we would get up at 4:30 and it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="3427">And I have a picture here shows the snows.</sentence><sentence id="3428">And we would take cold showers, because there was no warm water.</sentence><sentence id="3429">And after that we would have breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="3430">But before the cold shower, we would run a mile or two.</sentence><sentence id="3431">All part of the youth movement -- exercise before we start the day working.</sentence><sentence id="3432">But there were <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shops</span> and all kinds of other.</sentence><sentence id="3433">So if someone would come in and observe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a camp of Companion de France.</sentence><sentence id="3434">And when I circulated, I had the Companion de France uniform and ID, so that I could take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anywhere and also not have to pay with my ID, because I was part of the Vichy government Companion de France.</sentence><sentence id="3435">But 80 percent of us were Jewish, hiding out; but this was a cover, and this facilitated our movements.</sentence><sentence id="3436">It was not until 2 sometime the end of the year -- December, the beginning of January -

will come for an inspection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Companion camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3438">Evidently word had come out, or the rumor had been circulating, that there is something fishy going on there.</sentence><sentence id="3439">They wanted to have a firsthand view.</sentence><sentence id="3440">Well, when they came later, 24 hours later, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was empty.</sentence><sentence id="3441">We received our walking papers.</sentence><sentence id="3442">I have them here.</sentence><sentence id="3443">The release papers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3444">We got tickets to go into various

hiding out community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>, we were engaged in producing false identification cards and to help children go get to the <span class="DLF">border</span> so that they should be able to cross into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to perhaps <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and further on to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3699">Q: How did you know about the <span class="DLF">landing</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3703">A: Because, sometime in April or early May, we had already had in the underground, through the Radio London, messages that indicated that sometime in June, in the first couple of weeks of June, there will be major events happening, which at this time could only mean a debarkation.</sentence><sentence id="3704">Where it would happen, we did not know.</sentence><sentence id="3705">But we knew it was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="3706">I did not feel that I would like to be confined when that happens, because there'll be a lot of turmoil out there.</sentence><sentence id="3707">There'll be a lot to do, a lot to see, a lot to be part of; and that was always my urge, to be part of something.</sentence><sentence id="3708">So that between that time and the actual landing, there was very little time to do whatever we had to do.</sentence><sentence id="3709">However, how did we feel, coming to your question about transporting.</sentence><sentence id="3710">First of all, we had to produce the cards.</sentence><sentence id="3711">We made them with false stamps and seals.</sentence><sentence id="3712">And we, we were counterfeiters, you see!</sentence><sentence id="3713">That's what we were -- just like when I escaped from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3714">The emergency was there, but I did it almost like a natural thing; because the urge was to be free.</sentence><sentence id="3715">So I did it, naturally, with all the trepidations involved.</sentence><sentence id="3716">But there were also trepidations in transporting papers or doing communication.</sentence><sentence id="3717">But at the time when we did it, the danger was not that apparent to us.</sentence><sentence id="3718">It's in hindsight, as you look: "What did we do?</sentence><sentence id="3719">My God, we were really young and...and dumb!"</sentence><sentence id="3720">That sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="3721">But when we did it, while we did it, it did not occur to us that it was in any way endangering us.</sentence><sentence id="3722">Yes, anybody was endangered who did not have proper papers.</sentence><sentence id="3723">You could go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> as a French citizen.</sentence><sentence id="3724">You could go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> to have a meal and the Milice(tm) would come in and, like random, make, make inspections or certain searches.</sentence><sentence id="3725">Well, if you were a Frenchman and you didn't have your IDs on you on that day and you were not involved in Resistance and you were not Jewish, you were a French farmer come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but you didn't have your -- any kind of ID on you; you forgot it; you neglected to take it along.</sentence><sentence id="3726">Even that would endanger you, because everybody had to have an ID.</sentence><sentence id="3727">So we were just part of a whole system of, of, of hazards and pitfalls and problems.</sentence><sentence id="3728">But we did not consider our activity as something that would be any more dangerous than anybody else living under that regime.</sentence><sentence id="3729">Although we were exposed a little more.</sentence><sentence id="3730">We would have been exposed a little more to the punishment, if they had found us with the cards on us, because that could mean instant death, which happened to my friend, Eugene Bass, on the 10th of June 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3801">Q: How did you find out what happened to him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3803">A: He didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night.</sentence><sentence id="3804">He did not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night.</sentence><sentence id="3805">So a few days later we contacted, a friend and I, his mother.</sentence><sentence id="3806">And she had found out from someone, some witness, that he had been killed.</sentence><sentence id="3807">And it was through the mother that we found out that Eugene had been killed.</sentence><sentence id="3808">And it would have happened to me, perhaps, and others in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that we were in on that same day, on the 10th of June, 1944, going towards Oradour-sur-Glane from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>, when we saw the German column, Das Reich -- or one part of the, part of the rear unit.</sentence><sentence id="3809">Because the advance unit had already been into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3810">And when we saw parallel to the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> the <span class="DLF">country road</span> where the German motorized the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and the half-tracks were heading into the direction that we were heading, rolling up all that dust, so some of us decided, "If the Germans are going into this direction, we certainly do not want to go into the same direction."</sentence><sentence id="3811">So before we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span>, there was another halt, another <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3812">There was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric commuter train</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Junien</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3813">So the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> before -- there were a couple of halts, stops, before we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3814">But the report on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> that I have on that particular sheet, the write up, says that anyone with a ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> that got off that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> that particular morning was taken off and immediately machine-gunned -- just like the other 900 some citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3815">The men.</sentence><sentence

and children in it.</sentence><sentence id="3819">The moans and the cries filled the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3820">A couple of weeks later, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> to view the scene.</sentence><sentence id="3821">And we stood there crying, with the tears.</sentence><sentence id="3822"><span class="INT_SPACE">Tables</span> had been set up with the remains of mementos: baby carriages, buckles, shoes, baby dolls, toys that the kids had taken with them.</sentence><sentence id="3823"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> has been built up later -- about a quarter of a mile, a half a mile further away, a new little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3824">But the original area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> is today still a <span class="BUILDING">shrine</span> to be visited, to reminisce and to cry.</sentence><sentence id="3825">Because it was really a stroke of luck that we even noticed that column.</sentence><sentence id="3826">We would have gone in there.</sentence><sentence id="3827">The mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> at that time, on this particular moment, was arrested, put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and in front of his two sons, his two legs were sawed off.</sentence><sentence id="3828">Reported right in the, in the, in the sheet that I have here.</sentence><sentence id="3829">The sons, before that happened to their father said, "Please, take us!</sentence><sentence id="3830">Do to us what you want to do, but not to our father!"</sentence><sentence id="3831">They cut off his legs, and they shot the sons, too.</sentence><sentence id="3832">There was just a handful of people surviving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span> out of 900-some people.</sentence><sentence id="3833">There could have been many more, because those who were hiding out 7 without papers, that will never be known.</sentence><sentence id="3834">There were people hiding out.</sentence><sentence id="3835">A lot of Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="3836">And this is exactly the place where we took some of those cards to.</sentence><sentence id="3837">So that they should not be in hiding continually, and also be
