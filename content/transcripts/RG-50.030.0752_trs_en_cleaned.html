<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6386">A: About that, I cannot tell you very much.</sentence><sentence id="6387">But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6392">A: We saw them in the distance.</sentence><sentence id="6393">We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place.</sentence><sentence id="6394">And in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they don't kill other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6407">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6415">Q: And did they give them to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6417">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="6418">Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="6419">I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief.</sentence><sentence id="6420">You know, a guy nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> was a mayor of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6421">He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces.</sentence><sentence id="6422">I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor.</sentence><sentence id="6423">I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's house</span>, and I asked him, I would like to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6424">He says, no problem.</sentence><sentence id="6425">He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6426">And of course, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> were all hidden.</sentence><sentence id="6427">You couldn't find them.</sentence><sentence id="6428">So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed.</sentence><sentence id="6429">And in fact, some of them were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6443">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6464">Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there, you were able to move out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6466">A: Oh, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="6467">Somehow or another, we got right through the <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6468">The <span class="DLF">fence</span> was torn apart, and we just walked out.</sentence><sentence id="6469">And we went to the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6470">I went a couple of times to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
