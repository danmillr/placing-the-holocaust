<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3785">Q: You mean, you -- you -- you kept the last one before you got the next one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3787">A: Yeah, before the next.</sentence><sentence id="3788">And so he had my fath -- last letter, with my false name.</sentence><sentence id="3789">And they found that, and they started looking for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3793">Q: And which false name was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3795">A: That was Dineke de Jong.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3797">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3799">A: And they were looking for me, so he smuggled a note out, and it reached us, also by a miracle of God, because that was so much work, he couldn't send it straight, and he had to trust a guard, it was a Dutch guy.</sentence><sentence id="3800">And the underground hated the Dutch people, especially the police who stayed and worked for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3801">And sometimes by the -- by the Communists they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="3802">Those adulterators, they helped the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3803">But this guy had stayed to help.</sentence><sentence id="3804">And for some reason or another, that Hein smuggled that note out via this guy, and i -- it came via, via, via, through lots of searching, and underground did that -- man delivered it to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, and they found Ab, the other leader.</sentence><sentence id="3805">And then it said, "Empty the P.O. box, and don't use it any more," because he had a key, and he would be afraid that he will be tortured, and if the other kept on sending, that would be heavy for him, with his hearing.</sentence><sentence id="3806">And he said, "And let Diet take another name, they know now her false name."</sentence><sentence id="3807">So then they were looking twice for me, my real name, and this name.</sentence><sentence id="3808">So it was getting -- the <span class="DLF">net</span> was getting closer.</sentence><sentence id="3809">And then he said, And let her warn all the guys, and then bring the documents from the -- from the thing to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span>, and he mentioned a nickname that we called this guy.</sentence><sentence id="3810">And so I knew what he meant.</sentence><sentence id="3811">So I got my other pe -- identification card again, and then the man asked me what name do you want to have now, because he had made so many.</sentence><sentence id="3812">So I says, "Well, the name of our queen, Wilhemina," and then I just heard the name Laarman -- Laarman.</sentence><sentence id="3813">And then he</sentence><sentence id="3815">5 said, "Where do you want to be born?"</sentence><sentence id="3816">And there was no time to put one in that <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> anywhere, and then you had to smudge it.</sentence><sentence id="3817">I says well, make it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surinam</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paramibo</span> is the capital, and that's <span class="REGION">Dutch territory</span>, and they can't check that, there was no mail there, they were free.</sentence><sentence id="3818">So -- and then he said, "What <span class="NPIP">job</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="3819">And that was a problem, because I couldn't say secretary, because if they said where do you work, there was no Willie Laarman, I couldn't say nurse, I couldn't say teacher.</sentence><sentence id="3820">So I said maid.</sentence><sentence id="3821">And there was an elderly couple in there, had said, "We would love to help, but we don't know how, we are so old."</sentence><sentence id="3822">So I went to them, I said, "Now you can help.</sentence><sentence id="3823">If I am arrested, you vouch that I am your maid."</sentence><sentence id="3824">And they said okay.</sentence><sentence id="3825">So I was the maid Willie Laarman.</sentence><sentence id="3826">And then I had all that stuff from the -- from the thing on my -- in an envelope in my blouse, and I had warned all the guys, and I had lunch with one of them, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwijndrecht</span>, and then I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span>, and that was a short trip, only one stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span>, and they -- this was in May deg44, they had -- were a whole year looking for me already, and the Gestapo still coming to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so they had never given up.</sentence><sentence id="3827">And then it turned out -- and that was so terrible, because normally if they thought you help Jews they came four or five times, and then they thought -- there were so many, then they gave up, but they never gave up.</sentence><sentence id="3828">And we had a spy in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Gestapo that was -- and he worked for us, and he looked in our files, and he found out that Mies had kept a diary, and they had found that diary, and in it said Toos brought 27 ration cards.</sentence><sentence id="3829">Toos brought 27 I.D.s.</sentence><sentence id="3830">Toos -- and Hein had been there also, but not so often because he was in other <span class="NPIP">parts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3831">And he had given the name Dick.</sentence><sentence id="3832">Dick did this, Dick -- so they were looking for Toos and Dick that they knew were doing the robberies, or part of the robberies.</sentence><sentence id="3833">And that Jewish deal wasn't even important for them, they wanted that, that's why they never gave up for two years.</sentence><sentence id="3834">So we knew that they knew everything about us.</sentence><sentence id="3835">But they didn't know who Toos was.</sentence><sentence id="3836">And then I found out that that Bram had been there, and Bram had been, not too long before that married, and his bride was crying his ide -- her eyes out.</sentence><sentence id="3837">And later I heard that she paid the Gestapo 5000 guilders.</sentence><sentence id="3838">And they told him, you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and your bride is crying at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3839">And then, I have no proof, but he was the only one who knew who the phone number was, so he gave the phone number to the Gestapo, and he was freed soon after that.</sentence><sentence id="3840">But I've never seen him, and I -- I don't know, the guy started out good, that he wanted to help Jews, so I didn't want to make a big fuss out of that.</sentence><sentence id="3841">And I don't know if it's in the book, he's now -- I heard that he died.</sentence><sentence id="3842">I checked later out, and I didn't want to go there, because I thought if he knows what that mentioning of that phone, for -- had for results, he would live this terrible remorse or something, so I've never made any.</sentence><sentence id="3843">But he was the only one who knew my phone number.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3891">Q: Diet, let me ask you a question.</sentence><sentence id="3892">If the Gestapo went to your <span class="BUILDING">parent's house</span>, did they say, give us pi -- a photograph?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3897">Q: They didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3898">They never asked for it.</sentence><sentence id="3899">So they had no idea what you actually looked like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3903">A: I don't think so, unless that there was anything in the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3904">But they had no idea, so that is a lucky.</sentence><sentence id="3905">But I had changed my hairdo, and I did different color glasses, you know, frames, so when they were after me, I always, for the new I.D. --</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="4878">And then she asked me where I lived, and I thought oh no, so I ran away and pretended I had diarrhea.</sentence><sentence id="4879">And then oh, she comes back, and what do I say, and if she's engaged to a German -- who is engaged to a German during this time?</sentence><sentence id="4880">So I was really scared.</sentence><sentence id="4881">And then I had heard that Mrs. Verschoor had lived there, and we all had diarrhea bouts, and then you were allowed -- they were allowed to leave their paper stuff, and I had to go.</sentence><sentence id="4882">So I saw that Mrs. Verschoor ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and there were 10 on a row, and we had to go in groups, and were watched by a female guard.</sentence><sentence id="4883">Anyway, Mrs.Verschoor runs, so I run, and I sat next to her, and --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4943">Q: Diet, we left off when you went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4945">A: Oh yeah, and then I asked this lady, I said, "Don't ask me any questions, but tell me anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paramibo</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4946">And I said, "A <span class="DLF">street</span>, where do people live, regular people."</sentence><sentence id="4947">She says, "<span class="DLF">Heerenstraat</span>," and she told me all about it.</sentence><sentence id="4948">So that was -- and then after the war | went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4949">She got out and her daughter got out.</sentence><sentence id="4950">And, well -- so I know that.</sentence><sentence id="4951">But that helped me, and when Ennie Meunier then came, I knew something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4959">Q: So you weren't afraid when she came any more?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4961">A: Well, I didn't like it, but at least I had answers, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4962">But I -- anybody who had anything to do with Germans, I stayed really away, and the -- like you say, I was very lonely there, because I couldn't trust anybody I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="4963">But there was one girl, and she was go -- when we were called out for hearings, we were scared stiff because that was life or death again, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4964">And it all depended on the mood of the guy who interrogated you.</sentence><sentence id="4965">And we knew it was in a little <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and there was one girl, and she was called out twice a week at least, and mostly around two o'clock in the afternoon, and I told you -- this May, June, July, August, beautiful day, summer, and she was never nervous when she went.</sentence><sentence id="4966">And she stayed awake for hours, she came mostly back around five.</sentence><sentence id="4967">And she had a couple of tan shades darker.</sentence><sentence id="4968">So I thought, you are not in that little <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the hearings.</sentence><sentence id="4969">I thought, you are a spy, you are planted here.</sentence><sentence id="4970">Because I knew they had done that in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, but from her I knew it.</sentence><sentence id="4971">So I was afraid for the spies, [indecipherable] but her, I had already pinned down.</sentence><sentence id="4972">And another thing happened, and that was kind of funny.</sentence><sentence id="4973">One time a big filling fell out of my tooth.</sentence><sentence id="4974">And you stick all your tongue in that when there is a <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4975">And what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="4976">So one night one of the girls wakes up screaming, screaming.</sentence><sentence id="4977">And so we went to the guys at the corners, because we didn't know they had -- by that time we were there so long they locked us in, and there was four guys, and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all open because we -- I think we stunk, because we had -- never had soap or shampoo.</sentence><sentence id="4978">But anyway, those guys, we were warned, and then they [indecipherable] there came an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, and they took her away.</sentence><sentence id="4979">And I thought, "What happens now to her when she is," -- I thought [indecipherable] kill her, or what And they said, "No, there is a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> here."</sentence><sentence id="4980">And that's all prisoners, the doctors, the nurses, [indecipherable] everybody is a prisoner except the leaders are Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4981">And I said, "Is there also a dentist?"</sentence><sentence id="4982">They said, "Yeah, there's also a dentist."</sentence><sentence id="4983">And by that time we had all had our prison dresses, and if you had had a hearing it was navy blue, gray, navy blue, gray, and it had pockets.</sentence><sentence id="4984">And if you had had your hearing, then you were classified, and you got a triangle, and you probably know about that, but when you were a political prisoner you got a red triangle.</sentence><sentence id="4985">If you were a murderer you had a green triangle, if you were gay you had a pink triangle, and I think the Jehovah Witnesses had silver, gray, or something.</sentence><sentence id="4986">But that was after your hearing.</sentence><sentence id="4987">And Corrie and Betsie had already been called out.</sentence><sentence id="4988">And so I heard that there was a dentist, and I asked permission -- a boring life, you know, every day the same, and we were hardly ever marching, because we weren't allowed to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4989">And so then I said, "Could I go to the <span class="BUILDING">dentist</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="4990">And with eight other prisoners, we were brought by a soldier with a machine gun to the</sentence><sentence id="4992">3 dentist.</sentence><sentence id="4993">So we walked through that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and it was in a little <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was -- I think next to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but I didn't know, we came through a <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4994">And we had eight of us to sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, and I saw that the dentist had a green triangle, and he was a Greek, but he spoke fluent English.</sentence><sentence id="4995">And he -- and he had a green triangle, so he was a murderer, but I thought, well, maybe he has killed a German, and then you know, for me he is a good mur-murderer, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4996">It's terrible that I say that, but you know, you didn't know what -- so anyway, it was my turn, and I -- but this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Vught</span> was so close to the <span class="BUILDING">Philips factories</span>, and all the young men had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and the top guys, who were necessary, they had been exemptioned to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4997">But they said to the Germans, we need Dutch people -- we need people to work here, we need laborers to do the work, why don't you send some busloads of those prisoners every day?</sentence><sentence id="4998">And then they were fed terrific by those Dutch guys, and Philips makes radios, there was no TV yet, so the Germans couldn't constantly watch, so those prisoners who worked there, they loved it, they got food from the Dutch, and if any of the German was gone, they put the BBC on, so they heard all the latest news.</sentence><sentence id="4999">And they told it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, so that dentist knew all the latest news.</sentence><sentence id="5000">So it was my turn, and he starts drilling, and he said, "Would you like to know the latest news?"</sentence><sentence id="5001">I said, "Yes, please."</sentence><sentence id="5002">So he told me they were marching up at <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and it was going so good for us, so there was hope, you know.</sentence><sentence id="5003">And then when my turn was over -- he did the temporarily filling in it, so I had to sit back on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, and the next one -- but that German had to watch us, but also the dentist and the patient, so he was slowly walking up and down, and up and down.</sentence><sentence id="5004">And I was sitting at the corner, and here was a <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5005">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> started slamming.</sentence><sentence id="5006">And that's such an irritating noise, so I closed it [indecipherable] and a moment later it was slamming again, and I thought, that is not coincident, so I kept my eye on it, and when the German had gone this, and was with his back to <span class="DLF">door</span> -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens a little slight, and a hand came up, so high piled with bread, much nicer bread than we had <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5007">And was margarine on it.</sentence><sentence id="5008">So I grabbed it, but the German could come back, so what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="5009">I gave all the girls one, and was no time to eat, so it goes here, that's where you stuff everything.</sentence><sentence id="5010">And then the German walked again, and the hand came again, and we went in [indecipherable] and we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> [indecipherable] down, and it was really funny.</sentence><sentence id="5011">And we knew the news.</sentence><sentence id="5012">So the next time -- the temporary, he did that three or four times, and then he said, "Now I have to put a real one in."</sentence><sentence id="5013">And I was so sorry, I thought no news, no bread, because we shared it with those eight girls, especially w-we thought were going to die.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5069">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5071">A: And I was so sad, and he says to me, "But I can drill a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in a good one," and he said, "T won't touch a nerve."</sentence><sentence id="5072">I said, "Yes, please."</sentence><sentence id="5073">And he did several of my good ones, and I was there for weeks.</sentence><sentence id="5074">And you won't believe this -- so then in the end, I think that he was -- and we heard heavy artillery in the distance, and that was your general -- we didn't know it was, but we knew they were our friends the liberators.</sentence><sentence id="5075">And the Nazis got terrible nervous, and these were our friends, and they didn't want anybody of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ever to be liberated.</sentence><sentence id="5076">And then they started, every sunset my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was right on the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and there was water, and they said there was electricity so you can't escape, and they said there is a <span class="DLF">mine field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5077">And then you had that <span class="DLF">fence</span> with the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and machine guns, and then there were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5078">And the machine guns were every time at sunset,</sentence><sentence id="5080">4 and it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> close by that we could hear it.</sentence><sentence id="5081">And one day I'm doing the laundry, and there were two clothes -- and all clothes, and it was covered with blood.</sentence><sentence id="5082">And one woman from the guards -- I remember it, you were never alone, and you longed to be alone for a moment, and think and pray.</sentence><sentence id="5083">And I had to clean the little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the guards were always sitting, and there was a [indecipherable] and I was very softly humming a -- a hymn that was really consoling to me, and this woman came in.</sentence><sentence id="5084">And she could have yelled at me, because you weren't allowed to sing.</sentence><sentence id="5085">And she said to me, and that's German again, I have to spell it, "Sie singen wie ein <span class="BUILDING">Heidelarche</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5086">You sing like a heather lark.</sentence><sentence id="5087">And I was really sad, and I didn't have a beautiful voice, but I knew that she was not the cruelest, you know, she had some soft.</sentence><sentence id="5088">And she was just on duty, so -- and she could speak a little bit Dutch, they all could.</sentence><sentence id="5089">So I said to her, "What is this, all this blood?"</sentence><sentence id="5090">And you know, I had to soak it, and blood has to go in cold water, in troughs where we had to wash ourself.</sentence><sentence id="5091">And it was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="5092">And she said, "[indecipherable] two guys who have been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbike</span>, they had an accident, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and they come out and need their clothes," so I washed them.</sentence><sentence id="5093">Two days later, I got 12 sets of bloody underwear and clothes.</sentence><sentence id="5094">And that whole 12 was filled with blood, and all the 12, and I thought this is not just something.</sentence><sentence id="5095">So I went to that spy, and they all did kind of pitiful to me, they thought you're a border case, you're not all [indecipherable], and they said -- Hanny Janssen was her name.</sentence><sentence id="5096">I said, "Hanny, I have to wash all clothes, you know, that - - that's hard to do every day, but now it's all bloody.</sentence><sentence id="5097">What would that be?"</sentence><sentence id="5098">I did real stupid.</sentence><sentence id="5099">She said, "Oh, that are guys who are, every sunset when you hear the machine guys, are executed.</sentence><sentence id="5100">They are traitors."</sentence><sentence id="5101">And it were our Dutch guys.</sentence><sentence id="5102">And you know, they dragged you from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="5103">And the next day I got 36 of those bloody clothes, and that trough was filled with Dutch blood.</sentence><sentence id="5104">It was so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="5105">And I didn't know if Hein had been brought [indecipherable] Ab and I started to look always when I had to wash those clothes, for names.</sentence><sentence id="5106">And I was shattered, and I don't know, I -- I cracked up, because also we had buried weapons in my <span class="BUILDING">parents house</span>, under the roses, under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span>, and I didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="5107">I thought, if they all the time come and search, and they dig up the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and they find the weapons, they've shot my parents.</sentence><sentence id="5108">I really -- I thought my -- I thought I was absolutely going crazy, I didn't know any more.</sentence><sentence id="5109">And if I didn't have my faith, I would have -- I was -- I cracked up.</sentence><sentence id="5110">I was -- the next morning I couldn't get up, I was paralyzed for three days.</sentence><sentence id="5111">And they sent the camp doctor, and he kicked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, he said, "There's nothing wrong with you."</sentence><sentence id="5112">But I was so weak that then they don't me -- me -- they didn't make me do the laundry any more, they gave me a broomstick, and I had to sweep.</sentence><sentence id="5113">And then I started hating them so much, you know.</sentence><sentence id="5114">We say I hate this, or I thi -- old President Bush hated broccoli.</sentence><sentence id="5115">And I think you don't know what hated is.</sentence><sentence id="5116">With every molecule in my body, hated those Nazis for what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="5117">And I was so angry with God.</sentence><sentence id="5118">I thought, you are there in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, these are your people that they're killing.</sentence><sentence id="5119">They're killing my people, and you can stop this, and you don't do a thing.</sentence><sentence id="5120">And I was praying God's damnation on the whole bunch.</sentence><sentence id="5121">I was still praying, but I was praying horrible prayers, only God's damnation.</sentence><sentence id="5122">God [indecipherable] this or that.</sentence><sentence id="5123">And just then, there was one girl that I -- I said I trusted too, apart from Mrs.Verschoor, and her name was Freddy, and Freddy was a Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="5124">And just in all this stuff that you heard, that was your General Patton, who was getting closer, and closer by -- and just in [indecipherable] of my hearing, and I had -- all those months I had trouble with you may not give false witness, it was one of the things what was in the Bible, a</sentence><sentence id="5126">5 story of a spy, Rayhab, and she lied, and she was not punished by God, but she was blessed [indecipherable] Jesus.</sentence><sentence id="5127">So when I thought of that, because I knew the Bible from that -- I thought, oh that's God permission, so I said, oh let -- okay lord, I consider that I have your permission to lie, and now give me a good story.</sentence><sentence id="5128">And for months I was praying if they had interrogated me then, I wouldn't know what to say.</sentence><sentence id="5129">But every day I'd work on that story when I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5130">And I was born -- I thought, as little ballast as you can have.</sentence><sentence id="5131">So you have a father, no he has died.</sentence><sentence id="5132">You have a mother?</sentence><sentence id="5133">She has died.</sentence><sentence id="5134">No brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="5135">Because if you -- three months later, I didn't know how long I would have to say it, you have to tell the story exactly the same, the same dates.</sentence><sentence id="5136">So it was really a matter of life and death.</sentence><sentence id="5137">And just when this all happened, I had my story ready, but I was repeating it every night, you know, because sometimes they shook you up at two in the night, and you had the hearing that -- in your sleep, or half asleep you may say the wrong thing.</sentence><sentence id="5138">And Freddy saw that I was called out for my hearing, and she knew that was life or death for everybody, except for this Hanny Janssen, and the officer from the Gestapo came for the hearing, had to sign me out.</sentence><sentence id="5139">And she pretended that she had diarrhea, and she stormed from her twine making, past me, and while he was signing me out she whispered in my ear.</sentence><sentence id="5140">I'm going to storm the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> for you.</sentence><sentence id="5141">And you know, me -- I say to friends, I'1l pray for you, but this was so much stronger, I don't know if you know that story -- the gay guard at -- that comic, you know, you see him with a ram going.</sentence><sentence id="5142">And you know something, another second miracle happened apart from the rain coat.</sentence><sentence id="5143">I walked out with that man, and we had to walk maybe eight minutes, or 10 minutes to the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the hearings.</sentence><sentence id="5144">And because I knew the Bible, and I was bombarded with God's promises.</sentence><sentence id="5145">And one of them is, not a har -- hair of your head will be harmed without the will of your heavenly father.</sentence><sentence id="5146">So they couldn't even touch a hair of my head without Him.</sentence><sentence id="5147">And the second one is something that you don't need every time, but it said also, do not fear be -- if you have to appear before authorities and kings, I will give you the words.</sentence><sentence id="5148">God promised me.</sentence><sentence id="5149">And I said, okay Lord -- like Tevye on this "Fiddler on the <span class="DLF">Roof</span>," you know, he was always talking to God, I said, "I have broken many promises, but this is a promise, and I hold you to your word.</sentence><sentence id="5150">But you just have to give me the words."</sentence><sentence id="5151">And I walked in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there were a whole bunch of Nazi -- very high Nazis sitting behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, S.S."s.</sentence><sentence id="5152">I knew their ranks, and I saw their medals.</sentence><sentence id="5153">I think about seven at a green <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5154">And I told you about the bad food we had, one slice of bread in the morning, one in the evening, and that was [indecipherable], then the <span class="DLF">line</span> leaves.</sentence><sentence id="5155">But once a month we got a package from the Red Cross, and that has a sandwich, and that had a little bit of toilet paper, and it had a square inch of pure lard.</sentence><sentence id="5156">And they had put some soy sauce in, so we scrape every day a bit of that.</sentence><sentence id="5157">But because of that bad food, we had all gotten phlegmones, I don't know if you know what that -- people in the first World War in the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had it.</sentence><sentence id="5158">It started as an itch, and then you got hives, and then they became so big like strawberries, and you always had them in your face.</sentence><sentence id="5159">And your whole face was out of shape, and in the end your skin couldn't hold it any more, and it burst open, and green pus was dripping down.</sentence><sentence id="5160">And we all had that on our faces, most of us, and it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="5161">And then it was the fifth month, I've never had shampoo, so can you imagine your hair greasy, just cold water, no towels.</sentence><sentence id="5162">And we looked a mess, and we have no mirrors, but you saw how the others -- so there I was sitting with those seven well fed guys across from me, and 15 minutes before, I'd wished them all death.</sentence><sentence id="5163">And I looked at them, and I thought, there you sit, you seven,</sentence><sentence id="5165">6 and you think that you can decide about my life.</sentence><sentence id="5166">You can't even touch a hair of my head if God doesn't let you.</sentence><sentence id="5167">And I thought you totally on the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span>, the -- and actually, the most strange thing, I could feel pity for them.</sentence><sentence id="5168">They thought they had it all, and they had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="5169">And then they ask -- started asking me questions, but stupid really had done so stupid in those months, and I'd never said one gerd of German, one word.</sentence><sentence id="5170">So I said, "TI don't know what you're saying."</sentence><sentence id="5171">So they called the translator, and he had to sit there, then they asked him the questions, but I knew it already, and then me, so it gave me twice the time to think.</sentence><sentence id="5172">And then in the end, the leader -- he had the highest rank, and he was in his 50's, and he said, "I have done nothing in my life but hearings, and I have developed a sixth sense," he says, "and I can't," -- and I was so afraid that I had slipped up somewhere, you know, because it was very important.</sentence><sentence id="5173">But he said, "I can't put a pin in your story, [indecipherable]," -- he said, "but my sixth sense tells me it's all baloney."</sentence><sentence id="5174">And I told him, because they said I was early 20, so my father must have been in his 40's.</sentence><sentence id="5175">And they said, "What did your father there?"</sentence><sentence id="5176">I thought everywhere before I thought a -- taxes.</sentence><sentence id="5177">I said, "He worked for the taxes," because that's everywhere, in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="5178">And then he said, "Where is he?"</sentence><sentence id="5179">I said he died, but of course he must have been young.</sentence><sentence id="5180">He said, "What did he die of?"</sentence><sentence id="5181">I said he was bitten by a snake.
