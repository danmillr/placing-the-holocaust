<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis.</sentence><sentence id="461">That, I think is the advantage of having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew.</sentence><sentence id="462">My father's father had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to marry my -- marry my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="463">And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, though he was not Sephardic himself.</sentence><sentence id="464">In fact they were from the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that borders on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience.</sentence><sentence id="466">And every time the word <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> was used, he spit.</sentence><sentence id="467">I didn't know him personally any more.</sentence><sentence id="468">He -- he died in 1917.</sentence><sentence id="469">He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="470">And -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that sort of things was part of the Jewish tradition.</sentence><sentence id="471">And there were two Jewish families living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, who had come from either <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and who had been exposed to this whole</sentence><sentence id="473">3 business of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east.</sentence><sentence id="474">So again, everybody was Orthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one's history.</sentence><sentence id="475">We had absolutely no identity crisis when all this came.</sentence><sentence id="476">People find that hard to believe, particularly 1 -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not brought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when someone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had -- who -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to power, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that time.</sentence><sentence id="477">But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn't socialize that well with other pe - - with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn't eat in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="478">And so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and eat with us.</sentence><sentence id="479">As one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the ha -- we first went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, this -- we -- <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were not that comfortable in those days, and we all were friends because we played on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="480">So the -- the intimacy that one now can experience in being in each other's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we had -- we did not have that in any case.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1254">People we -- were divided.</sentence><sentence id="1255">They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I mean, you know, this conservative party of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1256">There were a lot of those in a rich <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goldaskreen</span>, and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing.</sentence><sentence id="1257">We have not got the means to go to war at the moment.</sentence><sentence id="1258">He s -- fo-fought for time.</sentence><sentence id="1259">The people who were liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn't have gone in for.</sentence><sentence id="1260">And the people who were lesstich labor, they -- they had been such you Jews, they had been such pacifists, that they -- they -- they wouldn't hear about -- about any requirements such as having a draft and mobilizing, and any of those things.</sentence><sentence id="1261">They -- they couldn't get used to this idea [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1262">And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr.Jacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor.</sentence><sentence id="1263">So we've faced reality, as best as we could.</sentence><sentence id="1264">And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other Jews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and a lot of -- and the difficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger and larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well</sentence><sentence id="1266">4 organized, largely by volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="1267">They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my opinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of the fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far, far below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1287">A: Well, you know, the point was that I had enough money to live on.</sentence><sentence id="1288">All I had to look after was t -- to do, was to work and work and work and try and get this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> simetric in four months, which I didn't succeed to do eventually, but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable] was the only thing I -- I was going for.</sentence><sentence id="1289">It's -- I -- I did not have to share in a lot of the hardships which other people were exposed to, because after all, my father could send me some money -- carefully, you know, didn't squander it in any way, lived very simple.</sentence><sentence id="1290">But it gave me certain pride to -- to live in a frugal way.</sentence><sentence id="1291">And as I said, my aim was to -- was concentrated on qualifying for the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> certificate.</sentence></p></dialogue>

experience.</sentence><sentence id="1315">It's an interesting story, you can tell it in great details.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn't work on Saturday, I wouldn't work on Friday afternoons, or would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early on Friday afternoons.</sentence><sentence id="1317">But they -- they didn't mind at all, they said, "Look, if you don't work, you don't get paid.</sentence><sentence id="1318">If you clock in and you clock out, and that's it."</sentence><sentence id="1319">Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized my -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where we were, that I should go to a certain <span

hope [indecipherable] the right address.</sentence><sentence id="1322">It turned out that my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be introduced to me.</sentence><sentence id="1323">These were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Steinats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1324">They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous Laskeys were the richest family

you see it's just all -- all a question of connection with -- and it was very important in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, everything is c- connection.</sentence><sentence id="1331">It's not what you know, it's whom you know.</sentence><sentence id="1332">And the Steinats made arrangements for me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr.Steinats father.</sentence><sentence id="1333">Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts.</sentence><sentence id="1334">He didn't like her at all.</sentence><sentence id="1335">But it came in handy for me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years older than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a

id="1339">Undoubtedly the Steinats were richer even than my father was.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great experience.</sentence><sentence id="1341">So I -- I

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1390">Q: Sure. [</sentence><sentence id="1391">tape break] So where were you when the war began?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1395">It -- first of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched and took over the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1396">Of course, everybody thought the war was going to break out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1397">Because now the attitude of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> to try and get a gr-great alliance with the Russians going.</sentence><sentence id="1398">And of course that was their big hope, that they eventually would pull that off, and pull it off together.</sentence><sentence id="1399">And -- and all the workers in -- in the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1403">7 <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I worked said we"|l be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won't be.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1404">They going to try this, and they're going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a major alliance with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1405">And this is very much what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1406">So nothing much happened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a war.</sentence><sentence id="1407">But the -- these two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elephants</span> were not in -- on the way yet.</sentence><sentence id="1408">Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was at the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span>, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1409">Quite young, he was in middle 30's, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the

community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1410">The day was glorious, the weather was glorious, the food was incredible.</sentence><sentence id="1411">Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot, and this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the Institute of Advanced Jewish Studies at <span class="BUILDING">Brandeis University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And he -- we became friends right there and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful lot, until the time he died in, I don't know, some times in the 80's.</sentence><sentence id="1413">He was professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, same time professor at <span class="BUILDING">Jerusalem University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And but that's -- basically he was a fantastic thinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span>, and then later on here, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and views that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding of Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way.</sentence><sentence id="1416">So that was sometime on May, 1930 -- deg39.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly transpired that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had made a pact

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1739">A: Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1740">By that time I had made my name in the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">See, you know, th-these -- these Pioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push themselves forward very much.</sentence><sentence id="1742">They were all experts at everything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1743">And I -- I, of course, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1744">Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of like a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round on -- and that was the major event there.</sentence><sentence id="1745">And of course there were all these guys there who had been such champions in all their <span class="BUILDING">Maccabee clubs</span>, and God knows, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1746">Well, I did the run, and I won it so easily.</sentence><sentence id="1747">And now I had made my name, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1748">I -- I -- I hadn't realized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were so -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1749">A-And I knew when w-we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> -- you know, we were not eating there, but were -- just slept there.</sentence><sentence id="1750">Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I knew this was going to be the change of my life.</sentence><sentence id="1751">And so it went.</sentence><sentence id="1752">When eventually the call came for people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to -- but there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports events, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our unit, to all these sports event -- events, and I've -- I've -- I was running on -- on -- on a cloud, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1753">So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I was</sentence><sentence id="1755">8 interviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot, and knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he's -- he's all on the pictures there.</sentence><sentence id="1756">I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make sure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable.</sentence><sentence id="1783">You know this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI.</sentence><sentence id="1784">And I was absolutely sure that I had been accepted.</sentence><sentence id="1785">I had no doubts about it whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And then, a few weeks later, or two weeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four others to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Pioneer Corps center</span> in -- in <span class="REGION">Yorkshire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1787">I think it was in <span class="REGION">Yorkshire</span>, horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1788">And there -- from there we were taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> by night, and the next morning we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abu Dhabi</span>, which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando.</sentence><sentence id="1789">And there we changed our names, changed our identities.</sentence><sentence id="1790">Within two hours, we all -- we had a false history, a false name, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1791">And that was the beginning of the -- being in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commandoes</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1804">A: My name was Fred Gray.</sentence><sentence id="1805">I spelled it a-y.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1845">Q: They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a British, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you're saying the fact that you spoke without an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1847">A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that, which you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we did this repeatedly, or in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1848">You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but once you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive.</sentence><sentence id="1849">Don't threaten them with a gun, just tell them quick how many --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1861">A: Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned out to be our greatest asset.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1863">Q: Who was in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span>, the numbers of people, and what was their background?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: There were 87 people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span>, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one or two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler's definition.</sentence><sentence id="1866">A lot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a Jewish father, and a non-Jewish mother.</sentence><sentence id="1867">Quite a number of those, quite a number.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Of course you know a couple like that had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> very early, otherwise life was impossible for them, and a lot of them did leave very early.</sentence><sentence id="1869">So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish [indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1875">Q: And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking for, that the British actually chose Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1877">A: No, they didn't choose Jews, no.</sentence><sentence id="1878">Those -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montgomery</span> -- I'm sorry, Lord Mountbatten.</sentence><sentence id="1879">Lord Mountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he's -- is the uncle of, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone through some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of combined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force, and Navy.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and that he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and</sentence><sentence id="1882">1 Churchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X- troops.</sentence><sentence id="1883">But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And then, you know, we became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando.</sentence><sentence id="1885">That's how we were -- were -- how we were known.</sentence><sentence id="1886">Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit -- units, Norwegian unit, and well, that's about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1899">Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I'm wondering if -- if it seems like it's been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well kept secret even -- even now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1901">A: Well, it's just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways.</sentence><sentence id="1902">The -- the skipper, the head of the troop got injured in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was taken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1903">He wrote a very nice assessment of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span> back in 1946 or so.</sentence><sentence id="1904">And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we -- we didn't

all that.</sentence><sentence id="1908">And particularly this was the attitude of -- of the parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends.</sentence><sentence id="1909">So the whole idea was not really -- we da -- we -- we didn't care to -- we didn't have any reunions until maybe the 40" anniversary of D- Day, and wh-what was that?</sentence><sentence id="1910">That would have been in 1984, right?</sentence><sentence id="1911">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1912">I -- I think that the first one was 1984.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And of course it's the -- Peter Maas's book that really

people were not to be promoted to officers in their <span class="DLF">field</span> without going to officer's training school.</sentence><sentence id="1929">Well, I didn't care two hoots about it, but it so happens that of course I was attached to a Marine unit.</sentence><sentence id="1930">And the Marines didn't have to take any notice of all these army uni- units.</sentence><sentence id="1931">I

learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and Jewish law, I've learned from him.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Well, the day when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or three other people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> where -- which was the only common <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1984">Q: Now, while you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commando</span>, did you still, in your own personal and private way, was religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1986">A: It's a -- ina sort of general way, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1987">But you know, there was too many other things we had to concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this.</sentence><sentence id="1988">I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a set of ideas which I practice, and it's -- I -- I'm not that comfortable in praying because the prayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to.</sentence><sentence id="1989">And just as you find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and</sentence><sentence id="1991">5 do -- do prayers.</sentence><sentence id="1992">And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was absolutely needed, but that wasn't very often.</sentence><sentence id="1993">And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not -- not pray.</sentence><sentence id="1994">I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pontlivek</span>, when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed, and I just -- I -- you know, Is -- I sort of said, get me out of this.</sentence><sentence id="1995"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bus</span> -- was addressing wa -- I was obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so.</sentence><sentence id="1996">And -- but it -- it required moments of that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion.</sentence><sentence id="1997">Normally the concentration had to be all on techniques.</sentence><sentence id="1998">Going through a <span class="DLF">minefield</span>, doing this and that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="1999">Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out.</sentence><sentence id="2000">You had to concentrate.</sentence><sentence id="2001">There was no time to -- to think of anything else.</sentence><sentence id="2002">And that's [indecipherable] made it all possible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

to go out with the massive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> that attacked the American and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British bombers</span> that attacked [indecipherable] <span

were sequestered -- oh, let me go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2033">The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up</sentence><sentence id="2035">6 just

had maybe something like 80 people.</sentence><sentence id="2046">And the -- all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flotilla</span> set out without light, without any intercommunication, in a pitch dark night.</sentence><sentence id="2047">And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents.</sentence><sentence id="2048">We sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn't see anything at all.</sentence><sentence id="2049">And -- and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2050">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came closer to the <span class="DLF">coast</span> in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o'clock in the morning by the time we landed.</sentence><sentence id="2051">But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment of the <span class="DLF">coast</span>, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us.</sentence><sentence id="2052">And one of us always sat on the <span class="DLF">steps</span>, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running commentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the German [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us.</sentence><sentence id="2053">Lucky tha -- luckily we were not hit.</sentence><sentence id="2054">And now, before all this, while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montgomery</span>, the</sentence><sentence id="2056">7 a -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, "Look, every time there's a landing, everybody sticks to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> because they want to be protected by the Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2057">Get off the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2058">You can -- don't," -- and that struck me as being very, very significant.</sentence><sentence id="2059">The really tr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn't get away from the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2060">And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="2061">So, when -- when the -- the -- the -- our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> approached the -- the <span class="DLF">coast</span> -- and of course as I said, we now were under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the <span class="DLF">gangway</span>, and I got -- got down -- was on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the engineer's unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the <span class="DLF">obstacles</span>, the anti- tank obstacles that were on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2062">And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them, "Where's the pass through the <span class="DLF">minefields</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2063">Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I didn't have any fear of <span class="DLF">mines</span> any more, but at that time I still was very much aware.</sentence><sentence id="2064">And lo and behold, when I didn't threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language, the first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2065">Different uniform and they could be on our side.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And lo and behold they told me.</sentence><sentence id="2067">I didn't threaten them, I had the tommy gun down.</sentence><sentence id="2068">I just said, in a very calm way, "Where's the pass through the <span class="DLF">mine fields</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2069">And they pointed it out to me.</sentence><sentence id="2070">And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I'd gotten through the -- gotten off the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single casualty.</sentence><sentence id="2071">So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50 percent of the unit.</sentence><sentence id="2072">Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day.</sentence><sentence id="2073">Later on, when we made the landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washoe</span>, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the <span class="DLF">Normandy beaches</span>, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the landing.</sentence><sentence id="2074">But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us.</sentence><sentence id="2075">And</sentence><sentence id="2077">8 everybody did the same as I did, get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, get over the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>, forget about it and get out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2135">Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2137">A: No, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="2138">This was the beginning of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2139">Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the German strong points were, and we were at the other end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2140">Luckily, the pass through the <span class="DLF">mine field</span> was at one end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the other.</sentence><sentence id="2141">I had no doubt where we were.</sentence><sentence id="2142">You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently.</sentence><sentence id="2143">I knew we were at the other <span class="NPIP">end</span>, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2144">Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points.</sentence><sentence id="2145">Why should they be out on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French villages</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2146">The French who have murdered them, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2147">So, the first thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the <span class="DLF">road</span> that was le -- going towards the German strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2148">But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, I -- and -- when it -- when it comes to -- when there's so much artillery fire and mortar fire.</sentence><sentence id="2149">It's -- the splinters will carry.</sentence><sentence id="2150">So you have to go from one <span class="DLF">door</span> to the other, dive in and dive out.</sentence><sentence id="2151">And of course the population was on our side.</sentence><sentence id="2152">They willingly opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="2153">So I says you know, you couldn't do this in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2154">We knew that we would never be able to do this type of street fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and we didn't intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it -- had come to the same conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="2155">So we were diving from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the other.</sentence><sentence id="2156">In some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment by one <span class="NPIP">side</span> or the other.</sentence><sentence id="2157">In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the <span class="DLF">road</span> first, there were some British soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> when the -- when a shell exploded.</sentence><sentence id="2158">You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions.</sentence><sentence id="2159">So we worked our way -- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2160">When we got into this <span class="NPIP">position</span> where we</sentence><sentence id="2162">9 thought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun pointing at us down the <span class="DLF">road</span>, we got off the <span class="DLF">street</span>, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2163">And I went upstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have seen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed.</sentence><sentence id="2164">So I rushed downstairs again.</sentence><sentence id="2165">I think I -- so I went down into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next, when we heard a loud bang on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door.</sentence><sentence id="2166">And ta -- so -- obviously some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">missile</span> was going from our side into the strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2167">So we really didn't know what the hell this was.</sentence><sentence id="2168">We were absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="2169">So we went there, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed the Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2170">And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war front loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2171">So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient in those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the meantime.</sentence><sentence id="2172">But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did.</sentence><sentence id="2173">And he was with us for -- until the winter of 1944 -- "45.</sentence><sentence id="2174">So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go with him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had now taken up around the German strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2175">And I went with him.</sentence><sentence id="2176">And he was one of those guys who wouldn't take no notice of any German fire.</sentence><sentence id="2177">He was running around with a briefcase.</sentence><sentence id="2178">His name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did.</sentence><sentence id="2179">And he -- he wouldn't throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a mortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn't going to do this, so I dodged the way I'd learned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was</sentence><sentence id="2181">0 out of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2182">So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified.</sentence><sentence id="2183">But then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main <span class="DLF">road</span> to -- on -- on to the German strong point.</sentence><sentence id="2184">Which was crazy.</sentence><sentence id="2185">The way we did this later on, we used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles</span>, and even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, only as mobile guns.</sentence><sentence id="2186">We had them -- h-hid them somewhere in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in.</sentence><sentence id="2187">Anyhow, this attack totally failed.</sentence><sentence id="2188">I didn't participate in it because I knew it would -- would be practically suicide to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2189">But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando, Y troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack, because as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was a German [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> pointing right down the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2190">There was no chance that an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> could get by that.</sentence><sentence id="2191">So we hadn't -- we hadn't -- we had not succeeded in taking the strong point on that day.</sentence><sentence id="2192">By now it was getting late.</sentence><sentence id="2193">We were in a -- on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span> somewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> that had a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of the food which we had, it was -- I hadn't eaten all day long.</sentence><sentence id="2194">I don't think we had eaten during the night either.</sentence><sentence id="2195">There was cocoa.</sentence><sentence id="2196">There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn't take strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much.</sentence><sentence id="2197">And jus -- just at that time, the -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British gliders</span> come -- being pulled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming over, to land on the other side of <span class="DLF">Lyon canal</span>, and they were sort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.</sentence><sentence id="2198">, Side B</sentence><sentence id="2200">1 Beginning Tape Four, Side A</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2272">A: So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned.</sentence><sentence id="2273">Also, by this time a German fighter came over and flew right along the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2274">And you know it says in the book the longest day?</sentence><sentence id="2275">That's -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn't true, lots of people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him.</sentence><sentence id="2276">But, you know, it -- one fighter alone could not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn't -- couldn't -- it wouldn't work in our case.</sentence><sentence id="2277">So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of D-Day.</sentence><sentence id="2278">I slept very well that night in my <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2279">I needed it.</sentence><sentence id="2280">Next morning, we continued what we were supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span>, move it inland.</sentence><sentence id="2281">We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luc sur Mer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2282">We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things.</sentence><sentence id="2283">So, next morning the first thing we -- it was decided we" ll attack the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> in -- inland.</sentence><sentence id="2284">Well, that didn't tu-turn -- it wasn't much of a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2285">This happens to be a battalion that had just come from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and they were pretty decimated.</sentence><sentence id="2286">And we decided we were not going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which came off beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the Germans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, they're -- very hard to understand them.</sentence><sentence id="2288">I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t- totally useless.</sentence><sentence id="2289">So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point -- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up.</sentence><sentence id="2290">And th -- so, I was late.</sentence><sentence id="2291">They -- I don't exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41</sentence><sentence id="2293">2 commando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had accidentally met already a year ago before that.</sentence><sentence id="2294">And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his people into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="2295">So we went on, and the next <span class="NPIP">stage</span> was very simple.</sentence><sentence id="2296">We got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luc sur Mer</span> very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the British Canadian landing, and now we were at the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the American and British beach head.</sentence><sentence id="2297">And that was supposed to be our D-Day assignment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day assignment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2325">Q: Now for the rest of the war, if you could give me a sense just generally, the kind of movements where you -- where you -- you know, what kind of <span class="REGION">territory</span> you covered in general, and maybe there are a few things that -- that come to mind that particularly illustrate the kinds of things you were doing.</sentence><sentence id="2326">I'm also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to surrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2329">A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don't think I ever -- ever was in that position.</sentence><sentence id="2330">My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get.</sentence><sentence id="2331">Find some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender.</sentence><sentence id="2332">This -- this has worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times.</sentence><sentence id="2333">Now, I must say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this and did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost was in a similar situation, too.</sentence><sentence id="2334">Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a rather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations.</sentence><sentence id="2335">They had been left behind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very heavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified.</sentence><sentence id="2336">And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile to make an attack -- a direct attack on them.</sentence><sentence id="2337">So we were positioned around them, near -- near</sentence><sentence id="2339">3 them, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were about to be attacked.</sentence><sentence id="2340">The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned to build an air -- airp -- <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away from these <span class="BUILDING">radar stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2341">And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> there that were suitable for landing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircrafts</span> on it, and this had to go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="2342">And they couldn't take any notice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there.</sentence><sentence id="2343">So our task was to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked.</sentence><sentence id="2344">And -- which we -- which we successfully managed to do for about a week or so.</sentence><sentence id="2345">There were a lot of adventures that we had, where we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two later when we had much more experience.</sentence><sentence id="2346">But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away with it.</sentence><sentence id="2347">Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a daylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful.</sentence><sentence id="2348">Again, I managed to get these guys out, to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="2349">So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them down to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, to the -- t-to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prisoner camps</span> of which there were there, but we shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="2350">That was an interesting experience which I've written up in great detail.</sentence><sentence id="2351">If you want to read, you can read it.</sentence><sentence id="2352">After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern front of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev -- very heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the <span class="DLF">Atlantic wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2353">And, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or through some <span class="DLF">hedgerows</span> to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and th-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed to keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn patrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out</sentence><sentence id="2355">4 unless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the <span class="BUILDING">radar stations</span> and he had went back to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">The Sergeant Major O" Neill was still with me, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell- shocked.</sentence><sentence id="2357">And O'Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw them -- saw him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2390">Q: Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question you and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you're Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up, was that ever a problem?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3189">Q: And when did you emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3198">Q: So I just have a couple overall questions and then we're done, I think.</sentence><sentence id="3199">When did you decide to write your memoirs about your experiences, and how long did that take you, and was that a difficult process or -- or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3202">A: Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before.</sentence><sentence id="3203">I had written it for my niece in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, the one who drew your -- your attention to my story.</sentence><sentence id="3204">When she was doing -- she was going in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo -- my tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough.</sentence><sentence id="3205">But the authorities didn't let her get away with that, so she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those.</sentence><sentence id="3206">And a lot of it came out as such at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3207">I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so [inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the computer.</sentence><sentence id="3208">And it's been -- it's been growing ever since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3216">Q: Has it been hard to do, to write about these things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3218">A: Oh yeah, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3219">It's ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not recounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took.</sentence><sentence id="3220">We were so inexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="3221">We learned pretty fast, I suppose, but we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been more experienced.</sentence><sentence id="3222">That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what wrong steps we took.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3228">Q: Although it seems amazing to me that you have such detailed and vivid recall.</sentence><sentence id="3229">Have you always had that memory all along of -- of all these incidents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3235">A: Well, I -- I don't -- don't think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have written up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them.</sentence><sentence id="3236">If I was to recall all the experience I've had in my professional life, I don't think it would be quite that experience, but I've had a very, very adventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have sat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, it would have been -- would -- they would have come back.</sentence><sentence id="3237">But you know, you start concentrating, and as you know, of course, these were very unique experiences.</sentence><sentence id="3238">And so the -- Peter Maas's book has been quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3243">Q: Are there certain sounds or smells that take you back to that time period?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3263">Q: And why -- why did you feel so motivated to do it right away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3265">A: Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done.</sentence><sentence id="3266">I didn't think that was a historical document.</sentence><sentence id="3267">Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had also been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a copy of it.</sentence><sentence id="3268">So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing of it all.</sentence><sentence id="3269">And I don't know that I've given you one of the originals.</sentence><sentence id="3270">I -- I can ge -- probably get a copy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up.</sentence><sentence id="3271">It's -- one of them is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>,</sentence><sentence id="3273">7 my cousin deposited it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did.</sentence><sentence id="3274">Of course, has mistakes in it.</sentence><sentence id="3275">This one you have in there is -- which was done on a computer by my secretary is -- is more correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3288">Q: And finally, do you feel that there have been things in your life, decisions, or the way that you've approached things in your life that come directly from, you know, the experiences, what you went through during the war, what also, in general, the Holocaust, you know, that experience?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3290">A: Yeah, yeah, it's hard for -- it's hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the matter is that I've had a few -- if -- if -- as I've done, if you put a large chemical plant on <span class="DLF">line</span>, with a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is more telling than almost anything I'd done in the war.</sentence><sentence id="3291">As I said in one of the comparison, on the night of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, 1944, in the night of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination plant on <span class="DLF">line</span> in -- in <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="3292">But it's very hard for non-technical people to realize what is involved in the invention, development, design and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process.</sentence><sentence id="3293">That -- that's one -- on aspect of it.</sentence><sentence id="3294">So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences.</sentence><sentence id="3295">The highlight of my professional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">University of Hanoi</span> in 1986, to a totally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when they should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not willing to listen.</sentence><sentence id="3296">I -- as I said, in one <span class="NPIP">state</span> I was in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Hanoi</span> lecturing 13 years before Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then.</sentence><sentence id="3297">But --</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3302">Q: I -- Is -- I think I read somewhere that you -- you've also been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and have spoken to students there.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3303">A: Yes, regularly.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3307">A: Regularly.</sentence><sentence id="3308">Oh that's a very interesting experience, very worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="3309">In 1988, on the anniversary -- or was it the -- the 50" anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back.</sentence><sentence id="3310">My two brothers came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with their wives.</sentence><sentence id="3311">Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along.</sentence><sentence id="3312">And we -- I made a condition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3313">And the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and again.</sentence><sentence id="3314">I've been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s -- he died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile experience.</sentence><sentence id="3315">I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that, but also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="3316">It's a great privilege to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3327">Q: And students you found were receptive?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3329">A: Oh very.</sentence><sentence id="3330">Extremely receptive.</sentence><sentence id="3331">They -- well, of course it depended a little bit as to who the teacher was.</sentence><sentence id="3332">If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very much more [indecipherable] than if it was just somebody who let us cu-cut in.</sentence><sentence id="3333">But this was a very worthwhile experience.</sentence><sentence id="3334">And as I said, they paid for it.</sentence><sentence id="3335">They gave us all expenses.</sentence><sentence id="3336">I've written up a lot about these experiences.</sentence><sentence id="3337">Unfortunately I have not [indecipherable] but when the BBC thought of making a film about my life, they wanted to incorporate this into their -- into that film.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3338">And no -- and just -- and th-they -- they, in fact they asked me, think you can get us some non --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="3342">9 ex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-how do you call it, non-regenerated?</sentence><sentence id="3343">The wa -- y- you know?</sentence><sentence id="3344">I said I can, yes I can.</sentence><sentence id="3345">I know we -- we can produce it.</sentence><sentence id="3346">It's still there.</sentence><sentence id="3347">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3348">Q: Did you enjoy going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3349">Was there a part of you that enjoyed going back?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3350">A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first experience.</sentence><sentence id="3351">My wife in the -- the first time -- she only went along once, she was very apprehensive about it, very apprehensive.</sentence><sentence id="3352">She somewhat frightened, but maybe she was already coming down with the sickness at the time.</sentence><sentence id="3353">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3354">Q: And your -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where you grew up, tell me just about the different stages it went through during the course of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3355">A: Well, when my parents left it became <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3356">And they even had a <span class="INT_SPACE">torture chamber</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">wine cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3357">And then it was taken over by the mili -- British military government as the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3358">This was when I came back there, only two days after -- after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> has been liberated, the advance people were just mo -- moving in.</sentence><sentence id="3359">It stayed that way for awhile, and after that they sold it, or they -- it was handed over to the German police.</sentence><sentence id="3360">It became <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a little while, not very long.</sentence><sentence id="3361">And then it went back into private possession.</sentence><sentence id="3362">At the moment it's largely -- there are four lawyers in it, I think it's [indecipherable] their <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
