id="125">If I recall it was like uh...with the celsius now, twenty-three below zero which was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="126">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span> was frozen and

it.</sentence><sentence id="128">We said it's just, it's just rumors.</sentence><sentence id="129">Nobody took it very seriously.</sentence><sentence id="130">And on the 23rd of January, there was a

class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">Still didn't realize what this all meant, but of course we couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="133">Then sometime in the morning uh my

her husband was Jewish...she came over crying.</sentence><sentence id="162">They took her husband away.</sentence><sentence id="163">So, so we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="164">We still...you start worrying but you still don't know what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="165">And in the evening, that evening, we heard rumors that people were getting killed and actually those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were carrying people and the blood was human blood.</sentence><sentence id="166">Well next morning we found out what happened...about uh fifteen to two thousand Jews were murdered, including...my uncle across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was not murdered.</sentence><sentence id="167">He was saved luckily.</sentence><sentence id="168">He was already down on

class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">They had to dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> because as I said it was frozen.</sentence><sentence id="172">Then it was frozen so they had to dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and throw the bodies into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">The only survivor was the dog.</sentence><sentence id="174">Their little dog was crying the next day...we went over there to see what happened and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was all set for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="175">The food, everything was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>...it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="176">The dog crying.</sentence><sentence id="177">And then you heard the

class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> like down the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a good friend of mine who was my teacher at one time...they were

class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">And then everything stopped.</sentence><sentence id="187">Then a few days later we decided to leave my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novisad</span>, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and there life was still quite normal.</sentence><sentence id="188">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">My aunt

long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and uh lived there oh quite normally for about uh I would say nine months, ten months.</sentence><sentence id="190">Then uh one day they said...again it was in the

registered.</sentence><sentence id="193">They said that uh in a few days we have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't say exactly where in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then when we went down there we got a white band so that distinguished you from a full Jew, from a hundred percent Jew...the white band.</sentence><sentence id="195">No star.</sentence><sentence id="196">Just a white band.</sentence><sentence id="197">And then we were taken, we were transported to uh a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian town</span>,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: What was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> like at that time...when you went back?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: Normal.</sentence><sentence id="299">Normal life.</sentence><sentence id="300"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> was still normal life.</sentence><sentence id="301">And uh the Jewish were still living, you know, in pretty normal circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="302">And then I uh recall one time when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on a weekend, I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and it stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> next to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...see, and...let me see now...that was the year after, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="303">Now the year after, when I was still going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was coming, and it was full of people, and at first we didn't know...it was all locked up, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...you know, those cattle, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">It was locked up and we saw people in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and crying and asking for water...then we realized...Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, transported, you know, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">We didn't know where they were going, you know...we found out later.</sentence><sentence id="306">They are taking them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">It was a horrible sight.</sentence><sentence id="308">Uh and as I say, then after one year we couldn't, of course they stopped us going back.</sentence><sentence id="309">They said we couldn't go back any more to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and from then on...that was...let's see...from "42 to "44, but uh we you know, we were moved from that <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> which was near the <span class="DLF">Romanian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">Also same type of work.</sentence><sentence id="311">Luckily we had a pretty good commander.</sentence><sentence id="312">Our commander was a pretty nice guy so uh we were not uh really suffering too much.</sentence><sentence id="313">Some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were worse off than ours.</sentence><sentence id="314">In uh...let me see now...this is "44.</sentence><sentence id="315">Yeah, and then one day of course I heard uh the the German troops, of course, the German troops were going through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and uh one day uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German train</span> stopped and I was talking to this uh German officer...spoke German, of course...and uh asked him what's going on and he told me he just heard that uh the Americans landed.</sentence><sentence id="316">It was June 6th, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="317">But he says we aren't worried.</sentence><sentence id="318">He says, you know, we are very confident, he said.</sentence><sentence id="319">And of course he didn't know who I was really so he was talking to me like nothing was going to happen, you know.</sentence><sentence id="320">Was in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="321">Uh now uh about uh...let's see...a few months later, see as the Russian armies were getting now closer already to that <span class="REGION">area</span>, I had a friend of mine, an older...about seven or eight years older than I was...told me that uh one of these days now, Cornel, he says we are going to escape.</sentence><sentence id="322">We cannot stay here any longer, because eventually they're going to take us from here to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else and, you know, we don't know what's going to happen, so we cannot stay here.</sentence><sentence id="323">You know, his plans where to take me with him to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, escape and go to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and, of course, he knew that I spoke Russian.</sentence><sentence id="324">And uh in fact the Russian army was coming.</sentence><sentence id="325">He, he ......for selfish reasons but more that he knew that I'm going to be able to communicate with the Russians and which is going to help him indirectly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: What was it like for you at that time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> (ph)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="357">Not really.</sentence><sentence id="358">Not really, because I think that the commander knew that the Russians are...of course, he knew, he knew that the Russians are coming.</sentence><sentence id="359">It was obvious.</sentence><sentence id="360">And he figured if he is nice to us, it's going to be better for him you see.</sentence><sentence id="361">So uh, which was true in a way.</sentence><sentence id="362">But anyway, so this uh friend of mine, one day uh we were told that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to pull out, oh in about three or four hours and go to some other <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">Didn't know where but anyway we're leaving this this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">So he told me...he says, Cornel - the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulls out - we're going to stay here and escape at night.</sentence><sentence id="365">And uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started pulling out...for a moment I was hesitating because I tried to stay with my younger, you know, friends, with my own age friends, but he pulled my arm.</sentence><sentence id="366">Stay.</sentence><sentence id="367">And we stayed and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out.</sentence><sentence id="368">We, of course, left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> right away and we went in to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">Yeah, sure.</sentence><sentence id="370">And we took, of course, the bands off but we still didn't look like Hungarian farmers, so uh, you know, you were not a hundred percent safe.</sentence><sentence id="371">Anyway, we went to the <span class="REGION">country side</span> and we went off the <span class="DLF">road</span>, off the <span class="DLF">highway</span> because the <span class="DLF">highway</span> was dangerous because, you know, the the German troops...they were already retreating and the Hungarians, but they were going on the <span class="DLF">highways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">And besides uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> were coming and bombing the <span class="DLF">highways</span>, so we went off the <span class="DLF">road</span> and uh we were hiding somewhere, you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and I remember, at one time they said these troops, the Hungarian troops...they stopped on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and the Hungarian...some of the soldiers were coming towards us because we were near a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> or something, and they were coming closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="373">So my friend said now let's act very normally and calm, because uh...and they came, they saw us and they said uh, what what are you guys doing here.</sentence><sentence id="374">I said we missed our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">We sold them a bill, bill of goods, you know, and they believed it, fortunately.</sentence><sentence id="376">So later on at night when the sun went down we saw a Romanian...there was a a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> see at that time...we saw a Romanian farmer and we called him closer and said uh please...we didn't speak Romanian but he understood...and says, you know, try to hide us.</sentence><sentence id="377">We have to uh get away, and he did take us in, fortunately.</sentence><sentence id="378">We were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="379">He took us in and we were hiding in his little <span class="DLF">farm</span>

safe.</sentence><sentence id="384">It's OK.</sentence><sentence id="385">So we came down from our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and the first thing, the first Romanian soldier I met took my watch, took my shoes, which were not too good but obviously looked better than his...oh yes...you know...we figured liberated, you know, they're going to put their arms around us...anyway, but we were free.</sentence><sentence id="386">We knew we were free.</sentence><sentence id="387">So then we started walking back to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, which was as I say from there perhaps about eighty, ninety, hundred miles.</sentence><sentence id="388">But this guy had these shoes with a nail in his shoes and (laughter) it was not easy to walk but there was not too much transportation and uh as we were walking, of course, we passed Russians and at one time we came to a <span class="DLF">crossroad</span> and uh some Russians soldiers standing there.</sentence><sentence id="389">And I saw an officer and he looked sort of like could have been Jewish...I wasn't sure but I talked to him, and he says, I'm Jewish, he says.</sentence><sentence id="390">But he says don't say anything because the soldiers don't know that I'm Jewish, said the Jewish officer.</sentence><sentence id="391">The Russian soldiers don't know and doesn't want it to be
