<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: All right, let's move ahead then to right before liberation.</sentence><sentence id="63">You said your mother came and got you from the family.</sentence><sentence id="64">Do you remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Yes, I remember because by this time I was very attached to the Von der Lindens, specially Mrs. Von der Linden and she was very attached to me, like a son.</sentence><sentence id="69">And my mother showed up.</sentence><sentence id="70">She came and visited me occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="71">But this time she came and she wanted to bring me to my parents" hiding place which was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that looked like it was in a vacant <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And I didn't know why she wanted to come and pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="73">I know, I was a little upset and Mrs. Von der Linden, also.</sentence><sentence id="74">But my mother said that she, I could come back after the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="75">So I went with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="76">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">And at some point, at a stop, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> came by.</sentence><sentence id="78">It was being pulled by a horse.</sentence><sentence id="79">Apparently it had run out of gas.</sentence><sentence id="80">And there was also a soldier lying on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with a heavy machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="81">They looked very insecure.</sentence><sentence id="82">They kept looking around and like expecting some, maybe to be shot at which is, was the case.</sentence><sentence id="83">But I didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="84">My mother said, going to that scene, she said, always remember this.</sentence><sentence id="85">Don't forget.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: And you still have remembered it?</sentence><sentence id="105">Very vividly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="109">I have not forgotten it.</sentence><sentence id="110">So then we went, I thought we were going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my parents were hidden, but in fact we went around the corner where there was a <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">And I didn't know this before but one day my mother had been walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> around the corner and some German soldiers came in the opposite direction on the same</sentence></p><p><sentence id="112">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 6 May 16, 2012 <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> so she got a little panicky and she went into the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">And once she was <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, she was just standing there and the woman who ran this <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> told her come in the back.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="114">There were, in many <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> there was a living area, behind the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">And above the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And my mother hesitated to go in the back.</sentence><sentence id="117">She was afraid.</sentence><sentence id="118">So the woman said that her husband was Jewish which was the case.</sentence><sentence id="119">And so they became friends and their <span class="DLF">backyards</span> were connected cause they were at right angles to each other and there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> separating them but they made arrangements to go over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in case some danger would happen to one or the other.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="120">In several cases, my parents went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">I don't remember these peoples" names, went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">One time I know it's because the Germans came to pick up the Jewish family living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="123">So they didn't know that it was, it wasn't for them, so they went over the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And as it was getting close to liberation, my parents moved in with this couple and that's where my mother took me also.</sentence><sentence id="125">By this time, or maybe a day or two later you could hear the cannon fire in the distance.</sentence><sentence id="126">And so we knew that liberation was very, very soon to come.</sentence><sentence id="127">I remember once I was standing in the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> and I saw, on the corner, I saw a group of men wearing khaki, but they weren't soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="128">I didn't know who they were and they were carrying cases, looked like wooden cases and they opened them up and they were distributing rifles to other men that came along.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="129">So I went back in the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> and I asked what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="130">Who are these people?</sentence><sentence id="131">And they were actually Belgians who were getting ready to join the fight against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="132">Then again shortly after that, I don't know how many days went by, I think it was maybe one day or so.</sentence><sentence id="133">One morning my mother took me.</sentence><sentence id="134">She said we're going to go to, it was a <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">I didn't know exactly why we were going there.</sentence><sentence id="136">And she said the English are there.</sentence><sentence id="137">I'm not sure what she said actually but she said the English.</sentence><sentence id="138">She probably did but I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="139">I didn't know what that meant.</sentence><sentence id="140">And so we started going and I asked my mother, why isn't my father coming.</sentence><sentence id="141">And she tried to explain that he hadn't been <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, except to go to the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> for two years and he was not ready to face people.</sentence><sentence id="142">So we were walking along.</sentence><sentence id="143">My mother was kind of in a hurry and we were on one <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">And we passed a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> that was burned.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I was fascinated.</sentence><sentence id="146">I don't know if it was, I assume it was a <span class="BUILDING">German tent</span>, now looking back at it and probably a Molotov cocktail had been thrown at it.</sentence><sentence id="147">It was burning on top.</sentence><sentence id="148">And I didn't seen any soldiers, just fire.</sentence><sentence id="149">So I stopped to look.</sentence><sentence id="150">My mother said let's go and grabbed me, my hand and continued with a lot of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="151">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 7 May 16, 2012 other people.</sentence><sentence id="152">Everybody was rushing to this <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">And when we arrived there, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> lined up in all the <span class="DLF">lanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">It was all very strange.</sentence><sentence id="155">There were a lot of, a lot of civilians around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and everybody was happy and cheering and my mother took me towards a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">There was a soldier standing on it.</sentence><sentence id="157">And we looked at each other.</sentence><sentence id="158">We looked at the soldier, he looked at us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="159">And then he put out his arms, downwards and my mother lifted me up and he grabbed me and -- (crying) -- he pulled me up.</sentence><sentence id="160">And he held me in his arms.</sentence><sentence id="161">I looked at my mother and she said, give him a kiss cause we didn't have any way of communicating with him.</sentence><sentence id="162">So I did and then I looked back down and she was crying.</sentence><sentence id="163">So I couldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="164">That was all, this job that my mother was crying and she said it's all right and I remember the soldier kept smiling as if it was ok.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="165">After that, I don't remember all the details but my mother took me back to the Von der Lindens like she had promised to do.</sentence><sentence id="166">But there was another reason.</sentence><sentence id="167">My brother and sister were by then they were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ardennes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">And my parents wanted to pick them up which wasn't easy because we had to go there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">municipal trams</span> maybe.</sentence><sentence id="169">But they weren't running.</sentence><sentence id="170">So and there was no communication so anyway I went back to the Von der Lindens and I didn't really know how long I stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="171">I only figured out a few years ago when I went back to the Von der Lindens.</sentence><sentence id="172">Every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> had a huge flag of the allies, American, British, French, Belgian.</sentence><sentence id="173">There wasn't a red flag.</sentence><sentence id="174">And these flags, I know how people made them.</sentence><sentence id="175">They were the size of double sheets hanging down in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="176">And then one day I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to play, as I usually did, but I quickly noticed that there were no flags on the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">So I went in and asked Mrs. Von der Linden.</sentence><sentence id="178">She ran a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, sort of a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And she said that the Germans might be coming back and she seemed very anxious cause I didn't know this at the time.</sentence><sentence id="180">It was many years later that I figure out this was the Battle of the Bulge.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="181">So this is the way I know that I spent much more time with the Von der Lindens after the liberation than I originally thought because the Battle of the Bulge was in December.</sentence><sentence id="182">The liberation was in September.</sentence><sentence id="183">And so I was still with the Von der Lindens at the time of the Battle of the Bulge, several months after the liberation.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="184">Then after probably a short time after that, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="185">My parents had found, rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where they lived was much too small for our family.</sentence><sentence id="186">And so they rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a nice little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my brother and sister and I were there, but also my cousin Lottie.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="188">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 8 May 16, 2012 Her father was my mother's brother.</sentence><sentence id="189">And her parents had been deported on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">Number, it was <span class="BUILDING">transport number 26</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">They also had a son who had the same name as my brother Manfred, or Mani.</sentence><sentence id="192">They were together.</sentence><sentence id="193">At some point they were hidden together by a priest who was well known for having saved a lot of, hundreds of Jewish children.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">Father Joseph Andre who has been recognized by Yad Vashem and many other organizations.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">He placed the kids in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> or <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">private families</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">But until he found the <span class="NPIP">places</span> they stayed with him.</sentence><sentence id="197">And both my cousin and my brother were with him when the Germans started watching him, suspecting that he was also involved in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">So he had to go into hiding himself, the priest.</sentence><sentence id="199">And my brother went to live with a family that was not really -- were friends of the family my sister was staying with in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ardennes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">But my cousin didn't have any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and so he went back to his parents" <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they were denounced.</sentence><sentence id="201">They were seen during an air raid, probably going to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and they were deported.</sentence><sentence id="202">My aunt is the only one that came back.</sentence><sentence id="203">But they had a daughter, Lottie, who was hidden someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="204">So my parents took in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lottie</span> and she was living with us.</sentence><sentence id="205">We still didn't know the fate of my mother's brother and his wife.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">One day his wife came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">I happened to be there alone one afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="208">The doorbell rang and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was this strange woman.</sentence><sentence id="209">Somebody I didn't know and she also looked strange a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="210">And she didn't say anything for a long time and I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="211">I knew I wasn't supposed to let in strangers in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she didn't say anything and finally she, she said I'm your aunt, Tante Dutche and I didn't recognize her.</sentence><sentence id="212">First two years had gone by since we had gone into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="213">But also she had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> during that time and on a death march.</sentence><sentence id="214">And so when she told me her name I let her in and my parents came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="215">That evening, after dinner, my aunt kind of spilled her guts, told the whole story from the beginning to the end and they were all very, very quiet listening to her.</sentence><sentence id="216">And also at some point she pulled up her sleeve and we all kind of looked or leaned over to see what was on her arm.</sentence><sentence id="217">It was her number tattooed on her arm. (</sentence><sentence id="218">pause) [had started going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">I, actually I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> already when I was living with the Von der Lindens.</sentence><sentence id="220">At first when they were living out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, it was a <span class="REGION">Flemish area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">There was Flemish which I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="223">So that didn't help me very much.</sentence><sentence id="224">Then later when they moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">French speaking school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">But there were some <span class="DLF">gaps</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="226">So when I moved in with my parents again I started</sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 9 May 16, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I was a year behind.</sentence><sentence id="228">And later I caught up.</sentence><sentence id="229">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood school</span> and the fourth, fifth and sixth grade were in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">So I could hear and see what this, the class ahead of me was doing so by the end of the fifth year of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the teacher said I could go on to the seventh grade which was a, in like what do you call it here, <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">So I caught up there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="232">In 49, my brother got his visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">Since my brother and sister and I were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but our parents were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we the kids got visas earlier because the quota was shorter for Germans than it was for Poles.</sentence><sentence id="234">So my brother got his visa first.</sentence><sentence id="235">My parents were not that interested in moving to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">They got established again in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">They were happy there.</sentence><sentence id="238">But my brother wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">And shortly after that, that was in 1949.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="240">Shortly after that my sister got her visa and she joined him.</sentence><sentence id="241">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="242">And then in 1951 my parents got their visas.</sentence><sentence id="243">They had, I guess I could have gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> before but I was only 11 when my brother left so they didn't want me to go without them.</sentence><sentence id="244">We came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, on the Queen Mary.</sentence><sentence id="245">And then --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: And before, we'll come to that in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="247">I just wanted to ask you some questions though.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="248">Was your family a very religious family?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Not at all.</sentence><sentence id="250">I mean

little religious but not very.</sentence><sentence id="260">My mother did keep kosher.</sentence><sentence id="261">What was before, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="262">My brother thinks that when they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they were a little more mainly a little more religious.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="264">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 10 May 16,

This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Harry Markowicz.</sentence><sentence id="1093">This is track number two and we were talking, that you were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span>, going to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1094">And how long were you, for how long were you in graduate school?Harry Markowicz: For over two years.</sentence><sentence id="1095">I was working on my masters which I didn't get.</sentence><sentence id="1096">I got into a program that they -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had set up between linguistics, psychology and French, literature, not French literature.</sentence><sentence id="1097">And so it involved almost three departments and there were a lot of infighting between the faculty.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So many of us didn't get our degrees because each one tried to get very high level of requirements for their <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">And I was teaching French.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Then for some reason two people in the same week told me about this new <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in I forgot the -- After that, sorry, after that I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">community college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tacoma</span>, Washington.</sentence><sentence id="1101">It was called <span class="BUILDING">Tacoma Community College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1102">I taught French there for two years.</sentence><sentence id="1103">Then these two friends told me about this new <span class="BUILDING">university</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Simon Frazer University</span> in <span class="REGION">British Columbia</span> near Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 25 May 16, 2012 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vancouver</span> and for some reason, both said this separately you'll fit in there.</sentence><sentence id="1104">So I didn't know exactly what they meant but I called the chairman of the foreign language department, or maybe I'm sorry linguistics.</sentence><sentence id="1105">It was a combination.</sentence><sentence id="1106">And I told him I was interested and he said ok come on up.</sentence><sentence id="1107">This was 67.</sentence><sentence id="1108">And we can talk.</sentence><sentence id="1109">So after a few minutes he offered me a position as an instructor.</sentence><sentence id="1110">I didn't have a transcript or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And then he introduced me to some of the people in the department and the French woman and she told me she was a graduate associate.</sentence><sentence id="1112">I knew what a graduate assistant was because I had been one but it's a little higher level and more paid.</sentence><sentence id="1113">So I went back to the chairman of the department and said what is this graduate associate thing.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Can I do it?</sentence><sentence id="1115">Cause I don't have a PhD and I'd like to work on it.</sentence><sentence id="1116">He said oh sure, you can do that too.</sentence><sentence id="1117">And so I, and they paid very well too.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So I became a graduate associate and taught French and I got my MA degree there.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Meanwhile, while I was there, I got interested in sign language, completely by chance.</sentence><sentence id="1120">I'll make it very brief.</sentence><sentence id="1121">I had in mind a research project involving linguistic universals which had become popularized or not only got popular but they were introduced by Chomsky, Noam Chomsky.</sentence><sentence id="1122">And but it involved doing a little experiment with artificial languages to discover whether one could learn a language more easily if it had universals.</sentence><sentence id="1123">But everybody already knows a language so that the experiment was not feasible until one day I read in a book called the Biological Foundations of Language that deaf children, before they go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> don't know any language.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So I decided ah ha, that's my, those are going to be my subject.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Just about this time there was a letter published in the <span class="BUILDING">Vancouver newspaper</span> in response to an article which I had not seen.</sentence><sentence id="1126">But the writer wrote that so and so, a deaf man has a little deaf girl, he and his wife are deaf.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And have a deaf girl who was two years old and she has a vocabulary of, maybe she was two and a half, of several hundred signs which she combines in two word sentences.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Two sign sentences.</sentence><sentence id="1129">This was exciting because that's what hearing children in whatever language they learn.</sentence><sentence id="1130">So I contacted the writer of the letter.</sentence><sentence id="1131">He was a director of <span class="BUILDING">social welfare agency</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And we talked and I also met a deaf man there.</sentence><sentence id="1133">He introduced me to this deaf man he was writing about who I don't remember how we talked, having a long conversation.</sentence><sentence id="1134">And it became clear to me that if you're deaf and you grow up in a deaf environment, namely <span class="BUILDING">deaf residential schools</span>, that it's very similar to being Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1207">Q: Why do you say that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1211">Interview with Harry Interview Markowicz 26 May 16, 2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1212">A: Because you are in a minority and you're part of a larger society but you're always a minority.</sentence><sentence id="1213">And the kind of relationships that develop among deaf people are the same kind of relationships you have among Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1214">For example, a deaf American and a deaf Japanese may have more in common than a deaf American and a hearing American in some ways.</sentence><sentence id="1215">There's a language aspect.</sentence><sentence id="1216">There's a whole lot of, though later in my life I started writing about the community, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">deaf community</span> as an ethnic group.</sentence><sentence id="1217">Anyway this became very fascinating for me.</sentence><sentence id="1218">I got hooked.</sentence><sentence id="1219">So I started reading books related to deafness and either the books didn't mention sign language or else they denigrated it by saying it's not a real language because it doesn't have articles.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And it doesn't have a passive voice which is pure nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="1221">There are plenty of languages that don't have articles or a passive voice, not a requirement for that to be a language.</sentence><sentence id="1222">So that immediately got a rise out of me and the director of this institute for the deaf told me

in.</sentence><sentence id="1232">Eventually in what <span class="NPIP">year</span> was that.</sentence><sentence id="1233">In 72 I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span> to work on my PhD at the suggestion of Bill Stokoe.</sentence><sentence id="1234">And so I studied at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span>

that all, he had been led to believe that with the new kind of hearing aids that were developed that that was not the problem anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1245">And so we got involved and he invited me to stay with him and I told him what I knew that.</sentence><sentence id="1246">So he, next, the next summer there was the world congress of the deaf took place in <span
