well in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">And we know that things happened during the war.</sentence><sentence id="195">But prior to the war for instance, to give you an example of the relationships is that when they said to put the yellow thing on the, to show that you are a Jew.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="197">Interview with Phillip Abraham 8 August 21, 2011 You know you put on your sleeve.</sentence><sentence id="198">The police were supposed to enforce that.</sentence><sentence id="199">But they grew up with the Jews so they never did.</sentence><sentence id="200">So it was you couldn't tell who is Jewish, who is not.</sentence><sentence id="201">So that was the situation and I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="202">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: This was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="204">Or a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: No it was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">And they had also a <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> or public and until the war started, when suddenly in 1940 the war that came.</sentence><sentence id="207"><span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at that time was an ally of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="208">And too, from the point of view of the Romanians I want to be, to say something that is not bad because they saw <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> defeated in three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="209">And <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> had just about all their forces.</sentence><sentence id="210">They had cavalry in stacks.</sentence><sentence id="211">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="212">And they said they couldn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="213">So they were patriot, from patriotism they said we have to go, even the famous or infamous men in power at the time, General Antonescu.</sentence><sentence id="214">He said and he was a patriot himself.</sentence><sentence id="215">That we cannot fight the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="216">In the First World War they did.</sentence><sentence id="217">But then <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was not defeated and all the others were attacking the Germans.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="218">So because of that in the end, when the war came, the Germans demanded from this general that the ambassador, the German ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that they collect the Jews from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, push them in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> so they will be there available for them to take until then.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Of course, the Romanians at the time didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="220">What was happening.</sentence><sentence id="221">That was quite secret, the Germans, the way they did it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">So the order came one day in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podu Turkului</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">That tomorrow you have to leave and go to the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was about 20 miles away.</sentence><sentence id="224">So you can, people had the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">What to do with the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and the merchandise.</sentence><sentence id="226">So most people took whatever they could with horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="227">And so did my parents, with one exception.</sentence><sentence id="228">My parents, my father decided he couldn't take all that.</sentence><sentence id="229">It was a large <span class="BUILDING">store</span> for fabrics and that's very voluminous and how to carry this in a horse, in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with two horses or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="230">So we, they took, what my parents took whatever was most valuable and so on.</sentence><sentence id="231">And my father went and actually put all sorts of wooden kind of in the front part of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and in the back and so on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="232">And it was so effective that later when we come in this story, nobody was able to enter there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="234">Interview with Phillip Abraham 9 August 21, 2011</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Before we go on, let's go back a little bit prewar.</sentence><sentence id="236">What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, before --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: We spoke Romanian.</sentence><sentence id="238">My parents of course spoke Yiddish, but on purpose because they at the time didn't know what is going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="239">They wanted, if you spoke Romanian then you had a chance to go have a good life and so on.</sentence><sentence id="240">Nobody would bother you.</sentence><sentence id="241">But if you didn't speak Romanian, kind of immediately you were a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="242">And so they didn't spoke Yiddish with us.</sentence><sentence id="243">I never, to this day, I don't know much Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="244">A few things that, but ordinarily they talked with us in <span class="COUNTRY">Romanian</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1817">And suddenly from one of them, one guy comes out running and it was kind of toward us.</sentence><sentence id="1818">And I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shlomo</span>, [foreign language phrase -- Hebrew?)</sentence><sentence id="1819">And then we hear another shout and another guy comes but he was after that guy.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1820">And Shlomo was a bigger guy than I. I was kind of short in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1821">I grew up later.</sentence><sentence id="1822">And I said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shlomo</span>, let's go a little faster.</sentence><sentence id="1823">He said no I'm tired.</sentence><sentence id="1824">Well I said let's go.</sentence><sentence id="1825">But nothing really</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1826">Interview with Phillip Abraham 38 August 21, 2011 happened.</sentence><sentence id="1827">So we came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and a <span

there.</sentence><sentence id="1829">He opens the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and get in.</sentence><sentence id="1830">We said we don't have money, ein

you know what happened today.</sentence><sentence id="1834">It's this and Arabs are attacking.</sentence><sentence id="1835">They are mad.</sentence><sentence id="1836">So and he took us to <span

and we ended up in the kibbutz safe.</sentence><sentence id="1838">But that was the experience that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1839">Q: What about in 48 when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">state</span> was declared?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1840">A: Well that was.</sentence><sentence id="1841">I was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, right.</sentence><sentence id="1842">And we were left and since the army was in, just started and so on, we were about like 17 at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1843">But they were not taking people who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> because they needed the food that was, there was no other way just to import and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1844">So they didn't take youngsters like myself at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1845">So we were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1846">Later on basically in 1949, but for us, this was, I must say this because the feeling that you had in those days when the, one may say oh we were scared right and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1847">Something is going to be war.</sentence><sentence id="1848">We knew that this is going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1849">They didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1850">We didn't care one bit about that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1851">What we were, this, after 2000 years we have our state and this experience is something that nothing else in my life can be as that experience.</sentence><sentence id="1852">To hear it, we are back after all this and being there.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I'm sure many other Jews in <span class="NPIP">outside</span> felt equally but we were there.</sentence><sentence id="1854">We were there in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so we have been there, as I said for about three years and so on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1855">So in 1949 our group was getting, we are by now 18 and excuse me, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz Arti</span> which is the organization of Hashomer Hatzair, decided to put us to send this group, instead of leaving us in HaShofet, they decided that they have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to send us, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called Gan Shmuel Al Kibbutz, Gan Shmuel Alomir Hadera.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And why because the people there were elderly.</sentence><sentence id="1857">They were not even Hashomer Hatzair.</sentence><sentence id="1858">So in the past a year or two or three years before that another group came in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hashomer Hatzair</span> so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> would survive.</sentence><sentence id="1859">But they weren't enough people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1860">So they decided because it was political as well to have so take this group, Kevrat Udem that was our name, bring us there.</sentence><sentence id="1861">And so they decided that.</sentence><sentence id="1862">We were all sad and later we found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was sad as well.</sentence><sentence id="1863">And we go there.</sentence><sentence id="1864">So in the meantime, this three and a half years we've learned all sorts of things to do.</sentence><sentence id="1865">We worked, we studied and I worked in the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1866">Interview with Phillip Abraham 39 August 21, 2011 <span class="DLF">gardens</span>, the fruit and all this.</sentence><sentence id="1867">And became an expert on that.</sentence><sentence id="1868">But I learned also mechanical things to do.</sentence><sentence id="1869">And we worked.</sentence><sentence id="1870">I remember carrying on my back a 200 pound sack of stuff over some, and so on, to put it in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="1872">It was ok.</sentence><sentence id="1873">It was we were proud of doing that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1874">We learned how to be on a rope and go up and down on a <span class="DLF">rope</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1875">That was the British army way.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1876">That is the best way that ever and I still can do it.</sentence><sentence id="1877">So we are proud of all these things.</sentence><sentence id="1878">But we come to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1879">We didn't know where we are going.</sentence><sentence id="1880">They were stranger to us and they behaved not like strangers, but like bitter toward us.</sentence><sentence id="1881">They put us to do the, also to things that only us to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And so and we had a man who is our supervisor, Madrek.</sentence><sentence id="1883">We didn't know that he was really a communist.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Amazing.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And he is allowed to steal this probably.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And at one meeting with him and so on, we started complaining.</sentence><sentence id="1887">What are you doing to us?</sentence><sentence id="1888">We have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mech</span> to ot [ph] meaning we have learned how to do this and you are sending us only to do only that work and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1889">And you're not treating us properly.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> it wasn't like that.</sentence><sentence id="1891">We, if you learn something that was that.</sentence><sentence id="1892">You could do what you learned.</sentence><sentence id="1893">So they put us in some old, not <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And crowded and everything was so, when I was one of those complaining And I said that that's not nice what you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And he said, if you don't like it you can leave.</sentence><sentence id="1896">And at that time, at the same time I said that's exactly what I'm going to do.</sentence><sentence id="1897">The next day or two days after I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadera</span> and I enlisted in the army.</sentence><sentence id="1898">And but the army said you have to come a week from now.</sentence><sentence id="1899">So I, where do I go?</sentence><sentence id="1900">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit, to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1901">I have not one penny in my pocket.</sentence><sentence id="1902">So I come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1903">I don't know even how I, how did I come.</sentence><sentence id="1904">There were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> but sometimes you could do hitchhiking and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1905">So I came back.</sentence><sentence id="1906">And he found out that I was back and he said to me, you cannot eat in the Hadera Ocher, no more.</sentence><sentence id="1907">You should get out.</sentence><sentence id="1908">But my friends who were still there they came and brought me the food from there and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1909">And survived and it was only two of us who did that.</sentence><sentence id="1910">I and another member, Zev, Zev and Godol there were two of them.</sentence><sentence id="1911">One is small (inaudible) and we enlisted.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And then a week later we were taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadera</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we trained, real training and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1914">Q: How long were you in the army?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1915">A: Four years.</sentence><sentence id="1916">And I was supposed to be really only two years but they said you can enter into Interview with Phillip Abraham 40 August 21, 2011 the regular army.</sentence><sentence id="1917">You can continue if you want and then you are a member of the Sva Keva, the regular army.</sentence><sentence id="1918">So I stayed because my parents had just arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1919">It was like 1950 and I stayed in the army.</sentence><sentence id="1920">I went into the air force, not as a pilot or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1921">They sent me to the adjutant general of the air force which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span>, ok, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jafo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1922">And I worked on kind of a, what can I call it.</sentence><sentence id="1923">An organizer, not the community organizer, but in the time that was, we work on making units of the soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1924">And the air force was interested to have, from the reserves, because there were people in the reserves to actually organize them.</sentence><sentence id="1925">We didn't have, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> but we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> for instance where you could go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Negev</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> so the idea was if they want to bring help to our troops somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1926">We need to have that to build an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and you are very smart in doing.</sentence><sentence id="1927">I was designing at the time just young as I was, put together people and so on in this, in making groups and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1928">That from the reserve people.</sentence><sentence id="1929">The <span class="DLF">reserves</span> they are until you are 50 years old, you are still in the <span class="DLF">reserves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1930">So I worked like that.</sentence><sentence id="1931">In the meantime, I was allowed, rather the army put together after work, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1932">Evening <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to get the group, to finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which I started in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> but that was not, I didn't have a --so that actually was the way that within the last two years I went and I got, I went to the exams, external exams.</sentence><sentence id="1933">But at the same -- that was exactly like the ones given in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1934">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="1935">And the same questions.</sentence><sentence id="1936">And I succeeded very well due to my teachers and I, at the end of that, in 1950, was I started, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1937">I was accepted for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> and studied there for my degree.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1962">Q: In what <span class="DLF">field</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1964">A: I started in physics and that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1965">At the time, they were, they didn't have a bachelor's degree there.</sentence><sentence id="1966">So you had at least in the mathematics and physics and so on, and chemistry, the hard sciences.</sentence><sentence id="1967">Maybe others as well.</sentence><sentence id="1968">I don't know but you had to get a master's degree.</sentence><sentence id="1969">A master's degree meant that you had to write a thesis as well.</sentence><sentence id="1970">And so I did all that and I got my master's degree.</sentence><sentence id="1971">After four years at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1972">And that was good.</sentence><sentence id="1973">In fact later on when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I realized that what I have done for my master's degree was considered, could have been considered here as a PhD thesis, because it was different standards at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1974">And in fact some of the people who didn't do it, they didn't get their degree.</sentence><sentence id="1975">They</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1976">Interview with Phillip Abraham 41 August 21, 2011 didn't do that in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1977">They didn't get their degree.</sentence><sentence id="1978">So they went, they did something else.</sentence><sentence id="1979">So that was my --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: So then you finished at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and then what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1981">A: Well I started, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> because there was somebody there who was looking for somebody like me.</sentence><sentence id="1982">He was an American guy who had got his PhD at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">MIT</span> in engineering, but nuclear engineering.</sentence><sentence id="1983">And he was at the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> and he said he needed somebody with knowledge of what was the modern physics, quantum mechanics, stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="1984">And he accepted me.</sentence><sentence id="1985">And he was supposed to lead to a PhD, given by the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1986">But we didn't quite see eye to eye in one <span class="NPIP">sense</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1987">I was trained in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span>, particularly mathematics at a level that <span class="BUILDING">MIT</span> didn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="1988">And very few of <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, the best <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in the world we had that kind of training.</sentence><sentence id="1989">And this man really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1990">So when I would, he gave me a topic to, and so on, to go into it.</sentence><sentence id="1991">And I did.</sentence><sentence id="1992">I studied the literature and so on and what I had.</sentence><sentence id="1993">And I would come to him with my results.</sentence><sentence id="1994">And so the one time that I present to him, he said no what you wrote here on the lab work, it's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1995">And you failed that (inaudible) true.</sentence><sentence id="1996">And he got red in the face and then I said I'm going to prove it to you.</sentence><sentence id="1997">And I did.</sentence><sentence id="1998">So that was the end with him.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1999">So he comes back to me a little later on, not that day.</sentence><sentence id="2000">You know what.</sentence><sentence id="2001">You should sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2002">You should go to the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span> and get your PhD there.</sentence><sentence id="2003">So how do I do that?</sentence><sentence id="2004">I mean I have no money.</sentence><sentence id="2005">My parents don't have money to send me there or anything like that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2006">So well they had advertised at the time, in 1959 they advertised that they are looking for people in physics.</sentence><sentence id="2007">And to apply, <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were applying and how come.</sentence><sentence id="2008">Where did they get the money?</sentence><sentence id="2009">The money came from the armed services because if you recall the Sputnik, everybody was scared that the Russians have taken over and so on and they really didn't have enough people in those hard sciences.</sentence><sentence id="2010">So they were putting this throughout the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="2011">Come over.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2012">I applied to one of the, it was one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yale</span> and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and they said at the time, they sent me back yes, I am acceptable but not for the very first semester.</sentence><sentence id="2013">In September.</sentence><sentence id="2014">But if I wait, I'm accepted.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2015">And only one other <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> said come on over.</sentence><sentence id="2016">So of course I, and they were going to give me a salary to live.</sentence><sentence id="2017">And study.</sentence><sentence id="2018">Well what other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> does that?</sentence><sentence id="2019">Of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2020">Interview with Phillip Abraham 42 August 21, 2011 course I came and I again separated from my parents and my family.</sentence><sentence id="2021">And I arrived here.</sentence><sentence

know to travel.</sentence><sentence id="2024">So my parents bought the ticket and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2025">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I had a little bit of money and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2026">Q: Did you know English?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2027">A: By that time, yes, yeah because I used English at <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> and also shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann Institute</span> with a guy from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span>, a Jewish guy who was also a student there.</sentence><sentence id="2028">And so it helped.</sentence><sentence id="2029">And I learned in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that's a little bit of another story.</sentence><sentence id="2030">How I learned English there.</sentence><sentence id="2031">I said there were Americans, and particularly my professor, teacher, Josef Vilfand.</sentence><sentence id="2032">He got his degree here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence

literature.</sentence><sentence id="2035">So he, I said I want to learn.</sentence><sentence id="2036">So he said ok, he gave me some things to do and so on and ultimately said oh here is Encyclopedia Britannica junior and here is an article about coal.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2037">And translate it into Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="2038">So I did, so I did and he would check, do these things and that's how I learned English so I wasn't yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2039">But I became really very easily here to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2043">Q: For how long?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2045">A: Well I was there 1960 and I was there until 1964 so I got my degree and PhD and I had my advisor was a guy named George Weiss, he was Jewish and religious Jew too and he lives not far away from here.</sentence><sentence id="2046">It's an amazing situation.</sentence><sentence id="2047">And we at the time when I finished it was quite a different, difficult time with jobs for physicists.</sentence><sentence id="2048">It's amazing within a short time this situation has changed.</sentence><sentence id="2049">Because with the ride to the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> and so on, there suddenly they said only reach that.</sentence><sentence id="2050">There's no more money.</sentence><sentence id="2051">So whatever you tried to get a job they said we are firing people.</sentence><sentence id="2052">And indeed that was a disaster.</sentence><sentence id="2053">1966.</sentence><sentence id="2054">So I got also the little jobs in between 1964 and 66.</sentence><sentence id="2055">Finally I Interview with Phillip Abraham 43 August 21, 2011 managed to get a job with a company in, Raytheon company in way back on what is the name, <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2056">And I worked for them and I was doing work, what they were interested of just actually was supported by the Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2057">I didn't know that at the time that the Navy, and but it was deltoid problems in the Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2058">And I was there for about, but I'm actually before, before that actually I had a benefit of working after I got my PhD, the National Research Council awarded me a three year salary to work at NASA.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And actually I have all this stuff here that my documents, ok.</sentence><sentence id="2060">I'm not saying.</sentence><sentence id="2061">So I worked at <span class="BUILDING">NASA</span> in Greenbelt Maryland.</sentence><sentence id="2062">And that was very interesting and I actually this was basically before, a little bit before I got my PhD.And I finished my PhD and submitted a thesis to the, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> and I was working at the time at NASA.</sentence><sentence id="2063">And among the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">committee</span> that the final thing you know.</sentence><sentence id="2064">You give talk about you show them your PhD and thesis and so on and they ask questions and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2065">And there was one guy from the committee that was part of the faculty at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2066">In the Physics, nuclear physics and he said to some people there.</sentence><sentence id="2067">Wait a minute in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="2068">This is not physics.</sentence><sentence id="2069">That is what you did is mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="2070">Why because my advisor was a mathematician, applied mathematician so actually he did work on <span class="REGION">areas</span> that were connected with physical things.</sentence><sentence id="2071">And what I've done were I worked for NASA and I worked on things that were, dealt with what are called solar flares from the sun ok.</sentence><sentence id="2072">And things that hadn't been done before except in my work at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2073">So as I'm there and he's talking like that and then my advisor gives a talk to my boss at NASA, Dr. McDonald.</sentence><sentence id="2074">And that guy hears about that.</sentence><sentence id="2075">Comes immediately from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenbelt</span> and comes to this meeting and he talks what do you mean mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="2076">This man has worked here on this and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2077">And so the committee decided that I deserved the PhD.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2113">Q: It was kosher.</sentence><sentence id="2114">You worked how long for Raytheon and then what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2117">A: OK so but I was still, then at that point I forgot to mention this, the order of the, I was with I worked for NASA and now I had my PhD. So because they liked what I was doing they said ok, you can stay with us for two years.</sentence><sentence id="2118">They couldn't hire.</sentence><sentence id="2119">I wasn't a citizen so they said you can work because the National Research Council will give you a two year, they'll pay my salary which was not a few dollars, right.</sentence><sentence id="2120">It was.</sentence><sentence id="2121">And I said ok that's fine with me and I stayed there two years and I did some more work.</sentence><sentence id="2122">And published and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2123">And at some point I was really Interview with Phillip Abraham 44 August 21, 2011 decided that I really didn't want to continue because the reason is that I as a physicist when I look at astrophysics as it's called today like with NASA was involved but we actually were, NASA was involved really in a real problems that had an impact on the, by the so called astrophysics.</sentence><sentence id="2124">It was kind of not something realistic.</sentence><sentence id="2125">I liked my work to be applied to something.</sentence><sentence id="2126">And it wasn't with the exception of these things that were really important to study those because communications is actually affected by solar flares, these things that happened every 11 years or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2127">And it was important for the air force for the military and even for NASA to know what is going to happen in such a case if you send a signal for instance, it can be affected by and really ruin it and that is not something that you want to have when you are in say war or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2128">So I decided I want to go in, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that will let me do things that are applicable.</sentence><sentence id="2129">And I looked around and one of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> said oh why don't you come over here to this company in <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span> and <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2130">He was working for the Navy at the time and said well Raytheon may, and indeed they hire me and I was with them.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And I worked on problems and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2132">I have even here my, what I did for them.</sentence><sentence id="2133">And then that particular one collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Gail Schwartz: this is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Volunteer collection interview with Phillip Abraham.</sentence><sentence id="2135">This is track number 3 and you were talking about working for <span class="BUILDING">Raytheon</span> in <span class="REGION">Rhode Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2136">Phillip Abraham: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2137">I worked there and problems that had to do with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2138">How to make sure that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> is not sunk by some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">missile</span> or detected by an adversary.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And this means that there is sound in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2140">It's not like the sound that we hear in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2141">But that can propagate through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> thousands of miles.</sentence><sentence id="2142">And in the process may hit an <span class="NPIP">object</span> like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2143">And reflect it.</sentence><sentence id="2144">And if there is somebody there waiting with their own sensors they say oh there is something there.</sentence><sentence id="2145">And they can determine sometimes what that <span class="NPIP">something</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="2146">So I worked on that.</sentence><sentence id="2147">And I did, I in my opinion and others I did good work.</sentence><sentence id="2148">But this was a little Interview with Phillip Abraham 45 August 21, 2011 company part that I was working in on this.</sentence><sentence id="2149">And it was actually given money for that research by the office of Naval Research in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> because it was an important need.</sentence><sentence id="2150">So but they didn't, the company itself didn't put money into this.</sentence><sentence id="2151">And suddenly the money that came from this part of, from the Navy stopped because in other projects they didn't provide what they were expected to.</sentence><sentence id="2152">So they cut them off.</sentence><sentence id="2153">And Raytheon decided to close this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2154">So suddenly all the people who were there are out.</sentence><sentence id="2155">They gave me two weeks" notice and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2156">And now I'm without a job.</sentence><sentence id="2157">And as I said, this was like it's like 1968, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2158">And I am without a job and Iam married and I have two little babies.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2203">Q: When did you get married?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2205">A: I got married in 1964 when I finished my --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2206">Q: Was your wife American or from Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2207">A: No she was an American yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2208">And we met through the other people.</sentence><sentence id="2209">She was at the <span class="BUILDING">American University</span> when I was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> and somebody said oh you should meet this and so on and we met and we got married.</sentence><sentence id="2210">So we had, we have two children, a daughter and a son.</sentence><sentence id="2211">Of course my daughter is close to 44 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2212">And my son is just 41, 42, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2213">And so that was, I was in a, and I was at the time, I was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New London</span>, <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> because that's where Raytheon group was there, that particular group.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2214">Even though they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhode Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2215">So I'm looking and I'm looking and trying to find a job.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2216">Finally I visited the <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span>, the physics department and I see something there, maybe on the bulletin board outdoors that they were interested in something like physicists or something.</sentence><sentence id="2217">So I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I met somebody named like Paul Clemens, a Jewish guy who got actually born in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, but had been in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, got his degree there.</sentence><sentence id="2218">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And he was the head of the physics department at <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2220">So he said well you know I, we don't have a spot on the faculty but I can arrange for you to be here as a research associate.</sentence><sentence id="2221">Some salary is better than nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2222">So I moved there to basically <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> is the <span class="DLF">College Park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2223">Sorry, not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">College Park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2224">What is it called.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2226">Interview with Phillip Abraham 46 August 21, 2011 Something, it escapes me now.</sentence><sentence id="2227">In any case, I moved to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and with my family and I was there for several years.</sentence><sentence id="2228">And they didn't have a real lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for me to become a real --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2229">Q: Professor.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2230">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2231">And on the faculty so I had to make do with a job still with the <span class="BUILDING">University of Connecticut</span> but not at that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2232">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span> they had a kind of a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">branch</span> up there and I taught there, undergraduates and some graduates.</sentence><sentence id="2233">And ultimately I escaped that because there was no hiring.</sentence><sentence id="2234">And finally I looked around and my friends who were in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and they said maybe you want to work for, let's see what did I do there.</sentence><sentence id="2235">I was in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2236">There is a place that can hire you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New London</span> that is not <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2237">It's the Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2238">And that, and I went for an interview and they hired me and I had to give some talks and so on and they hired me.</sentence><sentence id="2239">And I was there for eight years as a member and I became, of course not a temporary but and with pension plan and all that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2240">And then I decided to move elsewhere and something happened also in my family.</sentence><sentence id="2241">We got a divorce.</sentence><sentence id="2242">So I moved from there to right here in Maryland basically and the <span class="BUILDING">Naval Research Laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2243">You probably heard of it.</sentence><sentence id="2244">And I arrived there and I was a member of the Naval and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2245">And they started doing research on what they were interest and based on the work I'd done before and I stayed there for seven years.</sentence><sentence id="2246">And one day they asked me.</sentence><sentence id="2247">There was a vacancy, a temporary vacancy at the office of Naval Research in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arlington</span>, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2248">And somebody that has your background and only for a month or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2249">Would you like to do that?</sentence><sentence id="2250">Managing something.</sentence><sentence id="2251">I never managed anything except myself and doing my work.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2252">But I said well I'll take it and see what, I wasn't losing my position at <span class="BUILDING">NRL</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2253">Ok.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2254">I come there.</sentence><sentence id="2255">So they give me a whole program with money to go and the first thing I do, I interviewed all these people who had already programs from this and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And I had to cut immediately a group at <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U.</span> That was, but what I found about myself, I found that I never thought of myself capable to do managerial work.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2257">But I learned and I became a manager as well, even though I continued to be my interest and I never stopped learning.</sentence><sentence id="2258">So I was there for the rest of my profession with them until 2007.</sentence><sentence id="2259">So that was, after 32 years of work for the Navy.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2261">Interview with Phillip Abraham 47 August 21, 2011 So in the meantime, that program that I started there that I was given at ONR but I mentioned the fact that I didn't know that Raytheon paid my salary because they got it from ONR.</sentence><sentence id="2262">I never knew that.</sentence><sentence id="2263">Suddenly I am at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ONR</span> and this is life, very.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2264">So one day my program, they decided that they don't want to continue to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2265">It was filled with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> and some stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="2266">But they had been doing so long with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>, basically since the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2267">If one goes back, the First World War when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> appeared and they were continuing in that and sometimes they reached a point where nothing new was done really to do better.</sentence><sentence id="2268">So they decided not because I failed or anything like that, that they are not going to put money in that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2269">And so what to do with this guy, me, that I am an expert in that.</sentence><sentence id="2270">They said well there is here a group that works in logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2271">Gives money to do science and technology logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And this right now it's headed by a captain who is coming, retiring from this job.</sentence><sentence id="2273">And we need somebody else.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2274">Would you like to take it?</sentence><sentence id="2275">Well I'll try.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2276">So yes, I tried and yeah in the meantime I had been, become also no longer belonging to NRL.</sentence><sentence id="2277">I was belonging to ONR.</sentence><sentence id="2278">So I'm entering this.</sentence><sentence id="2279">I didn't know what logistics is.</sentence><sentence id="2280">Only some very primitive idea.</sentence><sentence id="2281">I looked in a dictionary and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2282">And then I looked at what this captain had done and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2283">He was a very nice man who, but he was not a scientist at all.</sentence><sentence id="2284">And what he did for, what he did was ok.</sentence><sentence id="2285">But it wasn't the science in there.</sentence><sentence id="2286">So here I was to try to find out exactly what other people have done who were being paid money and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And the first thing that does, I do, interview these people.</sentence><sentence id="2288">I went for instance to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic U</span> where there was a group there working with a program.</sentence><sentence id="2289">And it's not logistics and I said you know I wrote to my supervisors at ONR that this should be cut off.</sentence><sentence id="2290">It was something a million something for three years.</sentence><sentence id="2291">And they didn't quite cut off because Congress intervenes in these things.</sentence><sentence id="2292">And the people in Congress have the power and the people upstairs in the ONR, they unfortunately they, instead of saying no.</sentence><sentence id="2293">This is not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do so I didn't suffer from it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2294">But so ultimately I took over this logistics program and it became indeed science and technology with a lot of people that were doing in <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> and also industry.</sentence><sentence id="2295">And maybe in <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2296">So quite a large I had ultimately something, a program with 35 million dollars per year that had to be, and I will go, travel a lot to see what they are doing and going directly to the people who were working on this and they had to give me a, every time what have they done.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2298">Interview with Phillip Abraham 48 August 21, 2011 And so on.</sentence><sentence id="2299">And discussing it and I would say go in a different direction and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2300">And I was - - and people were at least those who I didn't cut off were happy with me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2301">But the, I selected the people who -- and I had connections.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Sometimes I would be asked to come and see what they are doing prior to.</sentence><sentence id="2303">And in one case it was something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span>, that's in <span class="REGION">California</span> and they have <span class="BUILDING">Cal Poly</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="2304"><span class="BUILDING">California Polytechnic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2305">And they said they have a new method of dealing with certain things.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And what they called intelligent agents, artificial intelligence, so called.</sentence><sentence id="2307">And they showed me when I arrived there.</sentence><sentence id="2308">They had three people with computers and the task that they had was to load with equipment a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that is, can bring these things to the, of the Navy into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and to resupply and so on with all these things or whatever to be.</sentence><sentence id="2309">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or any, everything.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2310">Now to load something like that, it's not easy on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2311">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is, has all sorts of <span class="INT_SPACE">decks</span> and it has <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2312">Can they do this or not?</sentence><sentence id="2313">They have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cranes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2314">It's a very complicated story.</sentence><sentence id="2315">And they used to put two people to work for one single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, maybe two weeks or more to decide whether they, how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2316">So with this intelligent agent, just on a computer having all the data about what loads they have to put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, they could do it in half an hour and they proved it to me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2317">And indeed this is one of the most successful things that I, and with not a lot of money.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2318">Some other projects cost millions of dollars and didn't perform as, but this with a quarter of a million dollars they advanced.</sentence><sentence id="2319">And nowadays they have a company of about 200 people that work on this.</sentence><sentence id="2320">And it's not only the US Navy and the Marine Corps and the Army but the British are paying to have this program.</sentence><sentence id="2321">And it was really something that, and I also suffered from it in one <span class="NPIP">sense</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2322">When you are in the <span class="BUILDING">Navy</span> you are any government and so on, you defend yourself from anybody else by saying this is no good for us.</sentence><sentence id="2323">We're going to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2324">You know we don't want that.</sentence><sentence id="2325">And indeed they refused to use something like that and this is a story, a long story in itself.</sentence><sentence id="2326">But so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2327">Q: It sounds like you've had a very interesting career.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2328">A: Really, I did yes.</sentence><sentence id="2329">And these people who, from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there, are still in connection with me and send me what they are doing nowadays.</sentence><sentence id="2330">I started also much more, not only this thing, but I went deeper into the, myself, into the what logistics should be about.</sentence><sentence id="2331">And something that I saying this, I'm saying this and people say you are bragging but it's true, a thing it's the truth.</sentence><sentence id="2332">Interview with Phillip Abraham 49 August 21, 2011 Because I started studying and see what is this logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2333">What do we do?</sentence><sentence id="2334">It's all these supplies and oh I need water.</sentence><sentence id="2335">I bring a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> of water.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Is that enough to do with that logistics?</sentence><sentence id="2337">No, I have, I realize by studying it really not just for the Navy that it's much deeper than that.</sentence><sentence id="2338">It goes all the way to the people in a <span class="DLF">mine</span> for coal and all these materials that we do or the people who grow food and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2339">Everything is connected.</sentence><sentence id="2340">When you hear you know oh we'll do this or put this, we'll send shovels to Obama style, ready shovels.</sentence><sentence id="2341">Who is making the shovels?</sentence><sentence id="2342">Somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2343">Well what are they made of and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2344">Oh in the <span class="DLF">mine</span> they bring this.</sentence><sentence id="2345">It's not a circle.</sentence><sentence id="2346">You have roots so many roots that to the final <span class="NPIP">object</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2347">But even more so even military philosophy and how do deal with the battle and all this.</sentence><sentence id="2348">So I wrote about this and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And only some people paid attention.</sentence><sentence id="2350">And interestingly enough, after 9-11, what do they do?The Navy decides they don't need logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2351">It was the stupidest, absolutely the, something that the public doesn't know.</sentence><sentence id="2352">They cut at ONR they no longer have anything, logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2353">It's to me it's a sad, very sad thing because many people have died because of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
