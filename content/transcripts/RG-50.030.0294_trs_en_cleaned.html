<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on August 8, 1920, son of a middle class family.</sentence><sentence id="14">My birth parents were fairly well to do people, not rich though.</sentence><sentence id="15">My mother was a full-time mom.</sentence><sentence id="16">She used to sing in the <span class="DLF">path</span> when she was young, but her career ended before I was born, I understand.</sentence><sentence id="17">My dad was a locksmith and son of | of 13 children, and when his father passed away he had to assume the responsibilities of taking care of the entire family of 12 sisters and brothers.</sentence><sentence id="18">Naturally, he had to go to work to support his family.</sentence><sentence id="19">That's why he didn't finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="20">Eventually when he married my mom, he graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, became a locksmith to survive and to earn a living, and then slowly in coming years he felt a need for education, and going to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span>, he became an architect.</sentence><sentence id="21">So I was raised in a middle class family.</sentence><sentence id="22">Very, very happy childhood.</sentence><sentence id="23">I had a sister, was one year older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="24">We lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> belonged to my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="25">The entire family, over 18, 19 people lived, there all my cousins so we see each other every day.</sentence><sentence id="26">Naturally, as you live with your cousins, one try to outdo the other win, scholastically, otherwise, and this was promoted by the parents, particularly our mothers.</sentence><sentence id="27">Now, I was playing violin since I was four and a half years old.</sentence><sentence id="28">I remember my first violin was bigger than I was.</sentence><sentence id="29">I couldn't hold the violin properly.</sentence><sentence id="30">I recall the tortured nights when they put cork between my fingers to stretch my ridge of my fingers to reach the octave on the violin.</sentence><sentence id="31">Naturally, this was not very promoting to my music career.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">I never forgot the tortures, but my mother was thus in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> when I start playing particularly, the concert, or so we had a quartet; my sister playing piano, my uncle, my youngest brother of my dad playing cello, my other cousin was playing viol</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was four people and I was playing violin.</sentence><sentence id="34">Of course, we were playing for friends of our parents.</sentence><sentence id="35">I would rather be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> playing tennis or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="36">But this was a ritual that for years was an understandable thing that we have to do and I liked it actually.</sentence><sentence id="37">But anyway, until I reach the age of 13 I would say, I had the idea that I want to be a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="38">I don't want to, would like to be a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="39">I don't want to be a musician.</sentence><sentence id="40">I knew I was not Heifetz or Perlman, but my mother would never understand that, and when I told her I wanted to be a doctor, this was like stabbing her in the heart.</sentence><sentence id="41">There were days I refused to practice ... and ... and with time of rebellion, a quiet rebellion.</sentence><sentence id="42">But then I had to do it, so after a day or two I start practicing again.</sentence><sentence id="43">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school of music</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">Eventually I graduate ... in <span class="BUILDING">academy of music</span>, and I was full fledged violinist.</sentence><sentence id="45">In the meantime, my father was involved in expansion of a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">This was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> where the principal was a bishop.</sentence><sentence id="47">I recall seeing him on occasions, walking in his robe in <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span>, accompanied by a rabbi with curls, side curls, you know, and this fur hat, you know.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">To me it was rather odd looking type of a connection here.</sentence><sentence id="49">We lived in the outside of <span class="REGION">area</span> where normally Jewish people lived, what they call Aryan are</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: It was modern <span class="BUILDING">edifice</span> and there were no Jewish people around there.</sentence><sentence id="51">So my parents spoke Yiddish here and there, mostly Polish though.</sentence><sentence id="52">I did understand Yiddish but I could never speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="53">And one day, going back to the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, my dad asked him kiddingly, you know what, my son reaching the age now that you have to enter <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">What you think of my son considered being a student in your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="55">He said "no problem."</sentence><sentence id="56">As soon as he passes the pre-entrance exam, he accepted.</sentence><sentence id="57">There is no problem.</sentence><sentence id="58">But then my dad replied, but this is a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> and we're Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="59">So, ... the principal replied.</sentence><sentence id="60">We prefer a Jewish student in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="61">Believe it or not, I started studying hard.</sentence><sentence id="62">I was a good student and I passed exam and the reality came through.</sentence><sentence id="63">I became the first Jewish student in the highly Catholic school, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">Well, my days in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were extremely happy.</sentence><sentence id="65">They were the best years of my life.</sentence><sentence id="66">I never felt I'm different.</sentence><sentence id="67">I didn't look different, but on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, kids in the <span class="REGION">area</span> knew who I was.</sentence><sentence id="68">They called me, you dirty Jew.</sentence><sentence id="69">You filthy Jew, for no reason.</sentence><sentence id="70">But my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I was never approached like this.</sentence><sentence id="71">I was respected by my colleagues.</sentence><sentence id="72">I think they liked me.</sentence><sentence id="73">I was excellent student.</sentence><sentence id="74">I was even assigned by teachers of certain <span class="BUILDING">class</span> like French, Latin, geography, history, to tutor my colleagues from the same class that didn't do so well, and all of them went through and passed the exams.</sentence><sentence id="75">So, I was very happy to hear that I was instrumental in helping my colleagues, and it developed a certain type of rapport with them, not because they are dependent on me, but it helped us to bind us together, I would say.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="76">And, I was very active in French club which I organized.</sentence><sentence id="77">I was very active in an art club which I organized, and then musical circle too, and then eventually I was nominated by the director of the <span class="BUILDING">musical department school</span> to participate in our symphony orchestra in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, to a point on one day we had a contest in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of different symphony orchestras in different <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and this took place in one big <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and won the first prize and I was playing solo forget like today and I thought, my mother was very proud of me then.</sentence><sentence id="78">She seen certain things, you know, that she hoped maybe I would fulfill a dream, and I was glad to give her this kind of satisfaction although, innerly I felt that's not the <span class="DLF">road</span> of my future.</sentence><sentence id="79">I was just insisting I would do something else and occasionally we discussed this and my mom didn't want me to talk about it about it.</sentence><sentence id="80">And there were different days you respected your parents more and whatever they say, really this was the way it was supposed to be.</sentence><sentence id="81">Maybe I was the first one in our generation in those days, that made quiet rebellion against, quietly, yet in the beginning but persistently pursued further.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="82">Anyway, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days were really fantastic.</sentence><sentence id="83">Sundays was customarily thing that all <span class="BUILDING">boys high school</span> all in uniforms would marching to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">I was in front with the band.</sentence><sentence id="85">I was playing saxophone and clarinet in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">band</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">And then when we arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, 800 or so students, went up to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and my <span class="DLF">road</span> led to the choir, and I was playing violin with the choir.</sentence><sentence id="87">Naturally, I was quite acquainted with the rituals with the prayers for eight years I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and I felt that I'm Catholic, except I was not baptized.</sentence><sentence id="88">I had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> next to Hanukkah.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="89">And I had a, had a kind of natural thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="90">No one making fun of this.</sentence><sentence id="91">But then here and there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> when I went to the <span class="DLF">park</span> or so, I seen Anti-Semitic remarks, and knowing who I was.</sentence><sentence id="92">One day I remember I was little.</sentence><sentence id="93">We went to the <span class="DLF">park</span>, wintertime, and one of my dad's employees took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">He was pulling me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">He was a professional wrestler, huge man, muscular man young in his 20s or so.</sentence><sentence id="97">It was a scene, a scene I never forget.</sentence><sentence id="98">Students of the <span class="BUILDING">local university</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Catholic university</span> attacked an older Jew, religious person with his side curls on, attacked him with sticks at the end which were razor blades.</sentence><sentence id="99">They are cutting off his side curls, and by doing this they chopped off his ear.</sentence><sentence id="100">Blood was flowing and I never forgot.</sentence><sentence id="101">I was a young kid.</sentence><sentence id="102">But they seen us watching them from a distance.</sentence><sentence id="103">They ran toward us, tried to attack us.</sentence><sentence id="104">But my dad's employee was very fast, athletic and so on, he pulled that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> fast and they were falling, you know, in distance and couldn't reach us.</sentence><sentence id="105">But eventually, they blocked our <span class="DLF">path</span>, you know, and they pinned us against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">He made a mincemeat out of them.</sentence><sentence id="107">He beat them so up, you know, that eventually police came in and arrested him.</sentence><sentence id="108">The fact that we were attacked meant nothing.</sentence><sentence id="109">I think he put to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="110">This was one episode I remember.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="111">But this never happened in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> though.</sentence><sentence id="112">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I was person, that I was not a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="113">I was respected by my teachers, professors, by the priests, you know, by everyone.</sentence><sentence id="114">That's why my memories going back now to those days are really great.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="115">And, I didn't realize at that time eventually, very soon afterwards this connection with my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and friends, colleagues, classmates, professors would help me survive.</sentence><sentence id="116">So this is about my childhood, very happy with a lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: When was that incident with the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: This was probably in about "32, "34, 1933, "34, about five years or so before the war.</sentence><sentence id="119">This was not an isolated incident.</sentence><sentence id="120">There were more incidents like this from then on.</sentence><sentence id="121">There was more German propaganda after Hitler came to power in "33.</sentence><sentence id="122">Then you seen people very traumatic.</sentence><sentence id="123">In front of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>, Polish people standing with signs "do not buy from the Jews, they steal your money."</sentence><sentence id="124">And in spite of this, many people going to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>, and then they are leaving the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> they were someone taking their pictures and eventually, they were using those photographs, the photographs in those and placing the propaganda with the name of the people who frequent <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And I seen all those things.</sentence><sentence id="126">I was already confused.</sentence><sentence id="127">Here I am in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">I thought I was Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="129">And to me, being Jewish didn't mean nothing.</sentence><sentence id="130">We are not a religious family although my parents had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, for one reason.</sentence><sentence id="131">All the Jews had <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">They felt that the meat was cleaner, more hygienic.</sentence><sentence id="133">Meat was not bought from a peasant who slaughtered the cattle some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, didn't know how hygienic was done.</sentence><sentence id="134">So no one got sick from eating kosher meat or so, but that's the only reason.</sentence><sentence id="135">But otherwise, we are not religious.</sentence><sentence id="136">But to explain yet my parents attitude towards me as their son, and to build up my identity although, they were not religious I say.</sentence><sentence id="137">Once a year we going to the little <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> was actually somebody's like <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, where the Jews were praying all day long.</sentence><sentence id="138">I remember that I was little boy then.</sentence><sentence id="139">I couldn't wait until the service was over.</sentence><sentence id="140">There was so stuffy.</sentence><sentence id="141">There was no air conditioning and I would rather to go out and play with the kids, but here I am, stuck with older people, you know, for a whole day until you are allowed to eat.</sentence><sentence id="142">You are not allowed to eat until sundown you know, so for a child, you know, this was ... but food was not a problem really, but those scenes you know, I remember until today.</sentence><sentence id="143">And then to reinforce my identity who I was my parents hire a teacher which they call a Rebbe.</sentence><sentence id="144">Rebbe is not a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="145">It is someone whose very well versed in the Hebrew teachings, you know, and the religious laws and so on.</sentence><sentence id="146">And he was coming, I don't recall, three or four times a week to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I remember he was falling asleep while he was reading to me and when he was half asleep, I was changing the book, you know.</sentence><sentence id="147">I was turning over the pages, you know, so we would get faster, you know.</sentence><sentence id="148">And when he woke up, half the book was turned over without him realizing it even.</sentence><sentence id="149">But, I got the touch of it anyway, you know.</sentence><sentence id="150">Not that I learned anything from him.</sentence><sentence id="151">But there is somethings I learned some things, prayers, you know, and but until today I was not very comfortable being in a <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> because I didn't grow up in that kind of surroundings you know.</sentence><sentence id="152">But I knew who I was.</sentence><sentence id="153">Then since there was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> and there was so many other Jewish students in different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">None Catholic but <span class="BUILDING">state schools</span> who didn't had no formal Jewish education.</sentence><sentence id="155">So once a week one of the professors of Jewish, of Jewish history was coming to our <span class="BUILDING">school Catholic school</span> teaching us about Jewish history, talking about the exodus of the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and all the uprisings you know, the Jewish history and we, so more or less were not ignorant about those things and then were graded on the base of his report.</sentence><sentence id="156">But I was also graded on New Testament, which I attended, so I was graded on the New Testament and also the Old Testament and religious education, and I had two grades.</sentence><sentence id="157">And this was very happy solution to me until summer of "39, prior to September 1, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="158">Rumors of Hitler Army moving, probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">We invade <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">We on vacation at time, summer vacation and of course, most of the Jews belittle the rumors.</sentence><sentence id="161">All Jews all rumor this and that, but as a precaution they decide to cut short vacation and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">Sure enough, September 1, "39 war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="163">Polish Army didn't last too long, Within less than two weeks, or three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="164">The whole army fall apart.</sentence><sentence id="165">Our government left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, first to escape, and only one that stood up yet was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, was defending self for several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="166">And <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> have a hell of a time, the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was invaded already and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was still fighting.</sentence><sentence id="167">In the meantime the Germans entered our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">First thing they did, all the Jews have to register.</sentence><sentence id="169">All the Jews have to give up their possessions.</sentence><sentence id="170">Their music instruments, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span>, furs, jewelry, <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, whatever was of certain worth to them they had to give it up.</sentence><sentence id="171">And of course, means of communications, telephones and radio.</sentence><sentence id="172">Germans were afraid of the local population listening to the radio, to <span class="BUILDING">BBC</span> maybe.</sentence><sentence id="173">So we're not allowed to have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>, and one day I remember my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> bloodied up.</sentence><sentence id="174">He was beaten by the Pole and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="175">He was caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">He was there to do some work you know, some labor work that day and they beat him up as a prepay and sent him <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">When I seen this, I seen what was to come here.</sentence><sentence id="178">| recall we sitting together, the whole family at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, discussing what should we do.</sentence><sentence id="179">It was too late to run.</sentence><sentence id="180">West we couldn't go, wanted us to know that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="181">The Soviet Army actually came from the East going West and they stopped at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> and the German Army stopped at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> too and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was slightly west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Bug</span> so we were at the fortune to be under German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="182">Some of my colleagues, Jewish colleagues, decided to go eastward, to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="183">With the blessing of my family, I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">My parents provided some cigarettes for me, for this was the best means of bribery and money didn't mean nothing.</sentence><sentence id="185">So if you want to ... were caught by anyone, especially Soviet solders, by giving a carton of cigarettes you buy your way out.</sentence><sentence id="186">There was not documents except the old Polish documents, and took me about a week to reach destination far east in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.61854" long="26.265704">Rovno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">Why do you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno?Rovno</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where my uncle, the younger brother of my father lived, and I thought at least I find somebody a relative of course.</sentence><sentence id="189">I arrived there.</sentence><sentence id="190">My ultimate goal was to enter the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and study medicine.</sentence><sentence id="191">But I was not accepted, maybe as much as good as I thought I will be.</sentence><sentence id="192">Mainly, because food was a problem.</sentence><sentence id="193">Staying in this small, cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="194">He was married.</sentence><sentence id="195">Had one boy, baby boy, and I know it was very difficult for them.</sentence><sentence id="196">So I try to spare them the problem and I decided to leave and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, the Germans call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span>, which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, about 250,000 people, site of <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, formally under the jurisdiction of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">Many intelligent people spoke German, and it was just a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I was very fortunate to take my pre-entrance exam and be accepted in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">Now you have to understand, that I was a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="199">I had nothing with me.</sentence><sentence id="200">I had no money.</sentence><sentence id="201">I had no clothing except what I had with me and I was hungry most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="202">But I still felt ... Lalways promised my parents I would pursue my education and that kind of an obligation I felt I should fulfill, and for myself too.</sentence><sentence id="203">I always wanted to be a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="204">So I was smart enough to find my way through and I was employed by the <span class="BUILDING">school cafeteria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">I cleaned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I was getting three meals and then knowing the people, then slowly, I was fortunate enough to secure myself a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for students, like a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I was paired with another student, also a refugee from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">We became good friends and I was doing well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="DLF">Janowska street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, but the way they treated us was just like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">We lying on wooden boxes really.</sentence><sentence id="347">Not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, boxes.</sentence><sentence id="348">There was

students, hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">How they escape I don't know, because they went through the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> very thorough, using the Ukrainian police with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="363">We decided to go eastward.</sentence><sentence id="364">The Russians were still not too for from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so hiding, going to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> at night or so.</sentence><sentence id="365">We try to stop some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian

we were.</sentence><sentence id="368">They were afraid too.</sentence><sentence id="369">They were running away themselves.</sentence><sentence id="370">So walking about 70 kilometers, mostly during the night, some during the day, especially through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> so we would not be visible.</sentence><sentence id="371">We reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zolochev</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about 35,000 people, I would

moment and like a movie.</sentence><sentence id="385">I said, that's a very short life though.</sentence><sentence id="386">And I didn't hear nothing.</sentence><sentence id="387">I just became totally numb.</sentence><sentence id="388">Maybe it's like a self-defense mechanism with your body that if you know that you were facing your final hour, maybe that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="389">I was never a victim of execution.</sentence><sentence id="390">So you don't know how to behave.</sentence><sentence id="391">It was so quiet, so peaceful, and I didn't hear a thing.</sentence><sentence id="392">And I was totally frozen.</sentence><sentence id="393">There were four of us lined up and I was second from the left.</sentence><sentence id="394">And then after a while, I don't know how long it lasted, I slowly opened my eyes, slowly.</sentence><sentence id="395">I thought, I cannot be dead.</sentence><sentence id="396">Its so quiet and peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="397">Where am I?</sentence><sentence id="398">Slowly, I turn to the left, slowly to the right, mostly with my eyes only, and I seen my colleague to the right.</sentence><sentence id="399">The last one was slumped over on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, so I didn't know if he was dead or not.</sentence><sentence id="400">But all my other colleagues, one on the left, one on the right, were standing like myself, erect and still.</sentence><sentence id="401">Slowly I turn more and more and I look around and I see nobody.</sentence><sentence id="402">Totally turning around I look, thousands of bodies on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="404">They looked like Muslims praying, you know.</sentence><sentence id="405">And they were all dead.</sentence><sentence id="406">Making a long story short, I found out that two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> came in, seen a gathering with the police and the German and they start shooting and bombing the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="407">One colleague was killed.</sentence><sentence id="408">We believed he was most likely killed by the Russians accidentally, not by the execution, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">firing squad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">When see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="410">The three of us grab my little suitcase, tiny little satchel actually, and run to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="411">The pogroms were still going on in the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="412">We hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, up to our necks.</sentence><sentence id="413">We took some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> to cover our heads.</sentence><sentence id="414">We stayed there at least three or four days or nights.</sentence><sentence id="415">Until we frozen to death.</sentence><sentence id="416">We couldn't stand it no more.</sentence><sentence id="417">We were hungry, exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="418">We didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="419">We're desperate and we just didn't care what happened to us no more.</sentence><sentence id="420">So we decided to get out the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and walking toward some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> we heard Ukrainians say, Oh, three more Jews not killed?</sentence><sentence id="421">How comes?</sentence><sentence id="422">You know, we kept walking, walking.</sentence><sentence id="423">I don't know how we happened to -- we walked into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, <span class="BUILDING">local hospital</span>, happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="424"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pogrom</span> was over.</sentence><sentence id="425">Whoever was killed was killed.</sentence><sentence id="426">Thousands of people were killed and they accepted us.</sentence><sentence id="427">They fed us.</sentence><sentence id="428">They cleaned us, gave us some clothing and shelter and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and asked us to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="429">But I didn't know what happened to my family.</sentence><sentence id="430">This was a very close-nit family and I had to find out if they were still alive or not.</sentence><sentence id="431">I didn't know how to make contact with the family.</sentence><sentence id="432">So I decided to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span>, which was my <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and I thought we knew some Polish people there.</sentence><sentence id="433">Maybe somehow they heard something, what happened to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> at least.</sentence><sentence id="434">So again, smuggling our way through, all three of us went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and I did visit one of the families.</sentence><sentence id="435">They didn't hear nothing but they say they will be able to transfer some of my message to the family if I know the address.</sentence><sentence id="436">But I didn't know the address.</sentence><sentence id="437">But there was no problem finding where the Jews are living now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">After a while, someone came to me, I was staying with those people, the Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="439">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not fully forming yet at that time so Jews were moving around, not freely, but they could move around.</sentence><sentence id="440">They had to be at dusk in their <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="441">And a Polish fellow came to me and said my father contacted him to bring me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">He was a cab driver who drove all night, only during the night, so he wouldn't be caught either.</sentence><sentence id="443">He had some false papers on some kind of Polish mission and I went with him back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, leaving my two friends behind, not knowing if we ever see each other, saying good-bye to each other.</sentence><sentence id="444">Driving at night, we arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="445">Of course, I found my family not in the original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="446">They were moved to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto area</span> which was behind ... the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the Jews used live there before, was a <span class="DLF">gate entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">You had to go, pass through, show your ID You go could to work through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> again into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">My father worked as an architect.</sentence><sentence id="449">Again, he worked for the German railroad, so right away I was a medical student.</sentence><sentence id="450">But he got me a job on the construction of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> as a medic.</sentence><sentence id="451">I had a white band with red cross on it.</sentence><sentence id="452">I didn't have nothing else with me.</sentence><sentence id="453">I could do nothing for anybody who got sick.</sentence><sentence id="454">I didn't know nothing about.</sentence><sentence id="455">Anyway, I was not a doctor yet, but this was a way of surviving, you know.</sentence><sentence id="456">And with him every day to <span class="BUILDING">construction</span> and I made a lot of contacts there with many Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="457">I contact some of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends and they were happy to see me I was still alive.</sentence><sentence id="458">They ask me what they can do for me.</sentence><sentence id="459">At that time I didn't know what they could do for me.</sentence><sentence id="460">We are not still in the situation very desperate yet ... and ... we were going through several selections what they used to call.</sentence><sentence id="461">Selection was the means of when the Germans coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">One night they arrive, maybe one in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="463">They want to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">Where we going to get a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>?</sentence><sentence id="465">We were not allowed to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="466">Remember, in "39 all the Jews have to give up all the musical instruments.</sentence><sentence id="467">So they didn't care where to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="468">Buy it.</sentence><sentence id="469">Where you a going to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> at one o'clock in the morning even if you have the money?So the people had to be taxes, I don't recall the sum of money needed, but early the morning they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they bought a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and delivered a grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="470">So we got a reprieve.</sentence><sentence id="471">A month later another selection.</sentence><sentence id="472">People were not necessary for the German government to sustain the war machine were eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="473">They were selected left, and right, left and right, and whoever was not needed were disappeared actually.</sentence><sentence id="474">They took them by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they left, no one knew where they went.</sentence><sentence id="475">We were fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="476">We were still together, the whole family until about April of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="477">In 1942 in April, the rumor was that the Germans are going to move all the Jews outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, there special <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> made for us.</sentence><sentence id="478">It's going to be like a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> for the Jews there.</sentence><sentence

"</sentence><sentence id="486">This was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of horse thieves and some peasants.</sentence><sentence id="487">They had a little cattle, like a pig or two, dogs, and you know, and they put the Poles and the Jewish in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment balconies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">You could see a pig on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and they were not very unhappy about it.</sentence><sentence id="489">They were not used to living in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, and the Jews were in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, about several kilometers away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was surrounded by empty <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">So was at that time no one thought about it that.</sentence><sentence id="491">This was strategically figured out by the Germans because they won't be able to hide.</sentence><sentence id="492">There are all empty <span class="DLF">fields</span> around this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">Unbeknown to us they are building already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>, which was only three or four kilometers away from this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="494">Some of my fathers Polish friends were employed as carpenters, came back and told my father.</sentence><sentence id="495">They are building some there, something very suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="496">We are working on it.</sentence><sentence id="497">We don't know what is it.</sentence><sentence id="498">It is some kind of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but maybe its for the German Army, for the soldier or so.</sentence><sentence id="499">But then they building something like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>, or something.</sentence><sentence id="500">We don't know what it's for and some of the Polish people say, I bet you they <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> to burn the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="501">And that's how the rumor started.</sentence><sentence id="502">But where you going to go?</sentence><sentence id="503">There is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="504">And in January I think, January ... No, no I'm sorry, not January.</sentence><sentence id="505">November 9 was total liquidation of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">Early in the morning the

id="512">We see the futility of the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="513">Because the announcement you could hear through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span> while were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="514">Anybody found hiding after such and such a time, 7 am will be shot.</sentence><sentence id="515">So your only time to escape now is to get out

know, it was not difficult to suspect something, stop him, put him aside, and take his pants down and know who we are.</sentence><sentence id="1534">Because only Jewish man was circumcised and this was the danger spot, but I tried to avoid situation like this.</sentence><sentence id="1535">So Lucine was working for the Polish Underground actually, indirectly, and all the hiding Jews were doing the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1536">They were taught how to make woman's hair nets.</sentence><sentence id="1537">It was a fashionable thing at that time to do.</sentence><sentence id="1538">They were taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> inner-tubes or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> inner-tubes and cutting into small strips, very narrow

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1895">Q: Was Lucine's brother still living with you then or is this after.</sentence><sentence id="1896">What was it like hiding with him in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1899">A: It was very pathetic.</sentence><sentence id="1900">He was little boy.</sentence><sentence id="1901">He was like a prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1902">It was hard for him to understand why he was hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1903">He knew he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1904">He knew he could not show 3 his face although he had good Aryan looks, but as a kid they could pull his pants down, they know who he is.</sentence><sentence id="1905">So was a sad thing to look at, him to be in hiding all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1906">He was pale.</sentence><sentence id="1907">He was deprived of the sunlight, sunshine.</sentence><sentence id="1908">He couldn't play.</sentence><sentence id="1909">I tried to be very near him, put arms around him.</sentence><sentence id="1910">He miss his parents.</sentence><sentence id="1911">He was at the age he understood.</sentence><sentence id="1912">He lost his parents and you couldn't replace it, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1913">There were times that he was questioning, asking if he ever going to see them again and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1914">He was still a child and on the other hand he was a grown-up, above his age.</sentence><sentence id="1915">The political situation just forced the people to grow up very fast.</sentence><sentence id="1916">So he was aware of what really the score is and on the other hand, he was only eight or nine years old you know.</sentence><sentence id="1917">I couldn't replace his father.</sentence><sentence id="1918">I was not old enough to act like a father, but I tried to do best I could.</sentence><sentence id="1919">I try to be the disciplinarian.</sentence><sentence id="1920">Sometimes he want to do certain things he want to do and so I say you cannot do it and I had to be firm.</sentence><sentence id="1921">And he tell, me you're not my father.</sentence><sentence id="1922">I said, I know.</sentence><sentence id="1923">I don't pretend to father.</sentence><sentence id="1924">But you cannot do it because all of us would be in danger, you including.</sentence><sentence id="1925">So it was a very tragic thing to see him going through all this thing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1926">I did not mention that during one of those days that we were together, that we seen, when we run away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that the policemen arrested Lucine we went to <span class="NPIP">emergency hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1927">That's the time that Lucine run to one of her friends, who turned out to be the mistress one of the German Gestapo man.</sentence><sentence id="1928">She knew she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1929">She said, what you doing here?</sentence><sentence id="1930">She was afraid to tell anything, because we didn't know -- Lucine didn't know who she is now.</sentence><sentence id="1931">Is she pro Gestapo or is she going to tell everything where we are and then Gestapo come arrest us all.</sentence><sentence id="1932">But she finally told her, look, I am doing this because I am desperate myself to save my life you know.</sentence><sentence id="1933">But you know I remember your parents.</sentence><sentence id="1934">I can help you maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1935">So she, Lucine, told her the whole story that the problem now is we don't have <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> anymore.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1936">We stay only a few days.</sentence><sentence id="1937">We didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1938">Next we have brothers with us and she said, you know, what this was is this <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Polish hotel</span>, that the Germans with a lot of money taking people and they go to <span class="REGION">southern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1939">The letters arrive from those people who went on transport to <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, writing back to their relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1940">Right at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, sunning ourself.</sentence><sentence id="1941">Life is different.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1942">We waiting for visas to go to <span class="REGION">South America</span> to <span class="REGION">North America</span>, to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I hope you can join us.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And Lucine seen those letters and they are truly letters, except that these people didn't realize this whole thing was a trick.</sentence><sentence id="1944">When we wanted to register they said, well, the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> not going to a week later, but this time it was totally full but if you come up with like $5,000 actually, and we didn't have this kind of money.</sentence><sentence id="1945">So talking to her friend we said, we cannot afford this kind of thing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1946">We want to go.</sentence><sentence id="1947">She said but, you know what, your little brother can take with you for nothing, but you have to come up with money.</sentence><sentence id="1948">So we said we have no money.</sentence><sentence id="1949">So she promised to take her little boy with her, and on given day through, going through certain stages of hiding and before reaching that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because you went in there was only Jewish people going in and who was going out, only Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1950">You didn't 4 know if Gestapo waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> or not so it was a tricky thing to get in and get out of this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and one day we delivered the little boy to this young lady who was very nice, and took him under her protection on that trip to so called paradise, <span class="REGION">southern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1951">We did receive one postcard from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> someplace that everything fine from him.</sentence><sentence id="1952">It was his writing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1953">But did he really write what he meant?</sentence><sentence id="1954">Was he forced to write it?</sentence><sentence id="1955">We don't know, but this was the last thing we ever heard.</sentence><sentence id="1956">The final thing what we heard actually after of the war, that the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to <span class="REGION">Northern Germany</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> someplace to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they were all eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="1957">So, the whole thing was a stage, a plot from the Germans who knew that some Jews were hiding and they paying for the safety to Polish people, but some running out of money so they had to sooner or later get out.</sentence><sentence id="1958">So they have some money left they could bribe their way by paying to go on transport to <span class="REGION">Southern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1959">Unfortunately, we couldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1960">We had no money, not that kind of money.</sentence><sentence id="1961">So we stayed without her little brother and we assumed the worst because we didn't hear nothing for months to come.</sentence><sentence id="1962">We suspected he probably perished, but for sure we didn't know at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1963">Life was going on and Lucine was selling her hair nets.</sentence><sentence id="1964">I making the hair net and off and on we lost our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> due to some suspicions that we had, maybe unfounded, but you couldn't take a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1965">So we jumped from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another one, always in contact with other hiding Jews, and they had our name and addresses and we had theirs in case their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was suspected of being not in order they run to us.</sentence><sentence id="1966">And one day one of her schooling girlfriends notify Lucine that her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> is no good and her husband is going to go to Polish Partisan, but he has to wait a few days and needs shelter.</sentence><sentence id="1967">So we took him to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1968">He slept to with us, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, all three of us.</sentence><sentence id="1969">And two days later he left us and went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish Underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1970">I understand he perished there and his wife perished too.</sentence><sentence id="1971">So we one day we looking again for another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1972">This was a constant situation every few months we looking for another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because people are not stupid and they suspect something and if unfounded even, they might suspect it and you can't take a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1973">They might call the police or so.</sentence><sentence id="1974">One day she met a lady who was a nanny to one of her Jewish boyfriends when she was little yet, and she knew that the lady recognize her already.</sentence><sentence id="1975">And they hug and kiss and so and she was a widow.</sentence><sentence id="1976">They was peddling some ham, bacon, you know, from <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1977">She had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room apartment</span>, little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchenette</span>, that's all.</sentence><sentence id="1978">Lucine told her we're without <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1979">She said, why you don't come to me?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1980">She said yea, but, you know who we are?</sentence><sentence id="1981">Oh, yes, I know who you are.</sentence><sentence id="1982">You know what we doing?</sentence><sentence id="1983">Oh yes I know what your doing but, I have to be paid for it.</sentence><sentence id="1984">We have little money.</sentence><sentence id="1985">What will this cost us?</sentence><sentence id="1986">Normally reasonable cost us about 50 to 100 Zlotys per month, and I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1987">I think we paid her 5 or 600 Zlotys.</sentence><sentence id="1988">I'm not 5 sure exactly the amount.</sentence><sentence id="1989">That's what she requested.</sentence><sentence id="1990">She was very happy to get that kind of money.</sentence><sentence id="1991">She was struggling economically.</sentence><sentence id="1992">So we moved in.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Move in, we didn't have nothing to move in with.</sentence><sentence id="1994">A coat, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and I move my little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with me.</sentence><sentence id="1995">I was making those little hair nets, producing.</sentence><sentence id="1996">Lucine was selling it.</sentence><sentence id="1997">Now, we have to think about safety.</sentence><sentence id="1998">I don't flush the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because both ladies, Lucine and this house-lady, were working so I couldn't walk around.</sentence><sentence id="1999">I couldn't flush the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2000">I waiting until they came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> not to create suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="2001">Floors were wooden.</sentence><sentence id="2002">You afraid to put your weight down because the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were squeaking.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2003">Be very, very, careful.</sentence><sentence id="2004">I used to walk on the board next to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was more solid and the planks wooden floor planks were not as flexible so without creating a noise.</sentence><sentence id="2005">Then this was in the corner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ceramic heater</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2006">I don't if you're familiar with European heating system.</sentence><sentence id="2007">It's made out of ceramic tiles, squares up to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> almost, and connected to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span>, and you were heating with coal there.</sentence><sentence id="2008">There was a little <span class="DLF">door</span>, <span class="DLF">metal door</span> you put your wood or coal this was.</sentence><sentence id="2009">Well, I decided to do to hollow out that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2010">I disassemble the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2011">Lucine would bring me clay each day, a little bit in a bag, a little bag.</sentence><sentence id="2012">I use a fork and a knife to disassemble without cracking the tiles.</sentence><sentence id="2013">Don't forget this was old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and from the base on I rebuild the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> using clay and water.</sentence><sentence id="2014">And I remove the top, the surface, the ceramic tile and I made a wooden planking and put the tile on top of the wooden planking so I would get cover.</sentence><sentence id="2015">But you have to heat it so what are you going to do.</sentence><sentence id="2016">So we bought a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron stove</span> with a pipe.</sentence><sentence id="2017">The pipe was going right in the middle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> into the <span class="DLF">chimney</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2018">There was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and a <span

the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2020">I was sitting like on horseback on the pipe.</sentence><sentence id="2021">Only thing I forgot not being professional, what am I going to do if the pipe is going to be hot because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> is being used for cooking?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2022">Didn't think about it and I didn't think about the possible gases emanating from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">contraption</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2023">I was not a scientist.</sentence><sentence id="2024">I'm not a professional bricklayer or stove layer, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2025">But it served purpose and I hope I would never have to use it.</sentence><sentence id="2026">All of a sudden one day we find out that the landlady had a cousin in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, who one day came in drunk, total drunk, and when he knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, I had only maybe a minute time to get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2027">I got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2028">He came in.</sentence><sentence id="2029">They tried to get rid of him, he was so drunk they couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2030">Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2031">I stay here overnight.</sentence><sentence id="2032">I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="2033">So I stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> all night.</sentence><sentence id="2034">When he left following morning,

id="2039">I was a heavyweight person and I started moving a little bit, but I was semiconscious and I got out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and they try to breathe in my mouth, artificial respiration, springing water, splashing water on me, and so on, and I come to it and I recovered.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2040">This was my first experience in <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> like this.</sentence><sentence id="2041">The other experience, I had, 6 another cousin, a woman came one day with a little poodle or a dog, small dog.</sentence><sentence id="2042">I had no time to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2043">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> so I hid in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> behind coats and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2044">All of a sudden, that little poodle start barking, coming toward the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and barking and barking and barking.</sentence><sentence id="2045">Didn't want to leave, and this cousin of this <span

probably have a little ham there.</sentence><sentence id="2048">I'm peddling ham, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2049">He probably want this.</sentence><sentence id="2050">So she brought a piece of ham to the dog, give him the ham and he ate it and stopped barking.</sentence><sentence id="2051">And there were few episodes like this where I was hiding.</sentence><sentence id="2052">But each time I escape without any problems.</sentence><sentence id="2053">Until one day our benefactor from the Home Army came to me and said to me, be prepared because the Polish Underground is staging an uprising.</sentence><sentence id="2054">In the meantime, prior to this of course, we're located next to the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2055">We see the

id="2065">We don't be able to get anything at all.</sentence><sentence id="2066">If you have any money left, any savings or so, buy something for it because the money will be worth

id="2069">He had no money to save them.</sentence><sentence id="2070">So he was selling whatever he could, his own things to pay for the upkeep of those people.</sentence><sentence id="2071">We gave him the money.</sentence><sentence id="2072">He returned the money to us eventually.</sentence><sentence id="2073">So Lucine bought some rings that's all you could buy in the <span

understood this.</sentence><sentence id="2639">So there was a kind of a chaos on the <span class="DLF">border</span> but it was not used up as a chaotic type of political purpose or so.</sentence><sentence id="2640">Everybody knew this was a purpose of family reunions, and we one day in this group everybody was saying remarks, you know, that we shouldn't stay here.</sentence><sentence id="2641">We shouldn't stay here.</sentence><sentence id="2642">So we thought maybe we should leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and go someplace outside of <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3560">Q: Tell me about going back and going back to the woman with the candelabra?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3562">A: After we come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, we couldn't forget that lady, that she was selling us for a silver candelabra to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="3563">How could a person who was a neighbor for years.</sentence><sentence id="3564">Her kids grew up with my wife Lucy, a neighbor.</sentence><sentence id="3565">She was a patient of my mother-in-law, who was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="3566">How could she?</sentence><sentence id="3567">Could I do the same to anybody?So I came -- we both came to her--we confronted her.</sentence><sentence id="3568">She became pale like a ghost.</sentence><sentence id="3569">She went down on her knees.</sentence><sentence id="3570">She crossed herself.</sentence><sentence id="3571">She didn't believe, that's us, that we survive.</sentence><sentence id="3572">She didn't know, she probably thought maybe they caught us that famous day that she called the Gestapo on us.</sentence><sentence id="3573">And I said, "you sold us to the Gestapo and here we are."</sentence><sentence id="3574">1 Now your life is at stake.</sentence><sentence id="3575">Don't have to do is point a finger, what you did to us and you be sentenced immediately, swift justice.</sentence><sentence id="3576">They shoot you right away.</sentence><sentence id="3577">She begged us, she was crying, screaming to spare her life in the name of her son and her departed husband, who died in the meantime, arrested allegedly by the German and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3578">I couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3579">My wife inquired to some friends what can be done, if anything.</sentence><sentence id="3580">I wouldn't let them be killed but I felt she should be aware of what she did and they told my wife.</sentence><sentence id="3581">Unless she has witnesses that we're there at that time, there is nothing she can do.</sentence><sentence id="3582">But the fact that the woman went through facing us was enough of pay back, what she owed us.</sentence><sentence id="3583">I don't know if she's alive or not but if she died by now, she died with the fact what she tried to do to us.</sentence><sentence id="3584">That day Christian blame the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3585">Crucify Jesus or Judas selling Jesus for silver.</sentence><sentence id="3586">She tried to do the same thing only she had killed Jews doing that.</sentence><sentence id="3587">If she was a religious person, real Christian, how could she do that?</sentence><sentence id="3588">Where was the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="3589">Single people, priests did help us.</sentence><sentence id="3590">They help us to get the real birth certificate.</sentence><sentence id="3591">You need ID.</sentence><sentence id="3592">Fakes were no good.</sentence><sentence id="3593">They checked it right away.</sentence><sentence id="3594">But we received through the Home Army the real birth certificate.</sentence><sentence id="3595">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was instrumental in helping us.</sentence><sentence id="3596">There certainly was a certain group of Polish people, definitely the intelligent people, people-- the real Polish patriot who knew who the real enemy is, not the Jews, and the little shopkeeper in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or so, and the milkman, the Jewish milkman was not a dangerous person to the Pole, and the intelligencia the Jewish professionals, doctors, lawyers, CPA, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3597">What a threat to the population?</sentence><sentence id="3598">None.</sentence><sentence id="3599">No one, maybe more or less.</sentence><sentence id="3600">That was a little jealousy, maybe because the Jewish professionals lead a more, extravagant life, maybe and it was striking something easy, visible.</sentence><sentence id="3601">See, the Jews were traveling abroad <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="3602">Most Poles, even the ones that could afford it.</sentence><sentence id="3603">They didn't do these things.</sentence><sentence id="3604">So there was certain differences, that the Poles did resent and I won't go into details.</sentence><sentence id="3605">I'm not a social workers and I never did any studies on the subject.</sentence><sentence id="3606">This is just my person observation.</sentence><sentence id="3607">But my thanks are due to some people.</sentence><sentence id="3608">We did survive thanks to some Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="3609">And we grateful to the Polish Home Army, the leaders, the people directly involved with us who saved many other Jewish people, poor people, without any compensation.</sentence><sentence id="3610">Risked their own lives, and I said it before, could anyone of us?</sentence><sentence id="3611">Try to inspect my own soul.</sentence><sentence id="3612">Could I do the same thing?</sentence><sentence id="3613">What those Polish people did?</sentence><sentence id="3614">I honestly don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3615">I was never a hero.</sentence><sentence id="3616">Maybe I'm a coward, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3617">But, they were heroes in my eyes, they were.</sentence><sentence id="3618">Maybe they were cowards too.</sentence><sentence id="3619">Maybe, they're running only because they're human beings, and I remembered the words of my friend who said, "I don't like you Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3620">I do it because I--nobody was going to help you."</sentence><sentence id="3621">He was a humanitarian.</sentence><sentence id="3622">He meant he was upset.</sentence><sentence id="3623">He was upset and was angry that they were arguing and in the Jewish -- in the Yiddish language where the neighbors could hear and jeopardizing his life, his whole operation, his whole army.</sentence><sentence id="3624">So I 2 understand.</sentence><sentence id="3625">But in order to understand my
