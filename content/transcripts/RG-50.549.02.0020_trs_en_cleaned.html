<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Well, I was thinking sort of when the Russians picked you up.</sentence><sentence id="44">But if you want, you -- wherever you would -- wherever you would like to start from, actually, would be fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Okay, we can start --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: It -- do you want to talk about how you got away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Well, actually, we were on the Death March and my particular group was liberated by the Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="50">After we were liberated, we were put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span>, which was a USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 4 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">And, of course they had to delouse us.</sentence><sentence id="52">They had to give us medical attention and they feed us and try and sort of organize.</sentence><sentence id="53">I mean, we were a -- a -- a very displaced group, a very sick group at that point.</sentence><sentence id="54">And once they took our names and asked us if we had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to, or whatever -- some of us chose to go back to our original <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and some of us stayed behind and stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="55">I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> for quite awhile and then I chose to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, hoping that possibly my brothers or someone that had survived, had come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that we could reunite.</sentence><sentence id="56">But I truly was mistaken, because no one came back.</sentence><sentence id="57">One aunt, who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span>, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> rather than coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, thinking that I hadn't survived, although sh -- she did see me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camp</span>, so she knew I was there.</sentence><sentence id="58">But she thought that I, too had gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, as millions of others had.</sentence><sentence id="59">And when she heard that I had survived, she too came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">So actually it was just the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="61">We came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and found our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- my mother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that we lived in, destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="62">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was used for a lookout post.</sentence><sentence id="63">It was like on a little <span class="DLF">hill</span> and the soldiers had used that and it was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="64">My grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- which was my aunt's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> who came back, stood.</sentence><sentence id="65">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was totally stripped of everything <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">There were nothing but <span class="DLF">walls</span> and <span class="DLF">windows</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="67">And w-we moved into this <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">Actually, I was the very first one to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and I was the first one to move into my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And I would go and meet a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that passed through our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> once a day, hoping that someone survived and people would come back.</sentence><sentence id="70">And little by little, some young</sentence><sentence id="72"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0020 5 people did trickle back.</sentence><sentence id="73">And -- including my aunt and we all lived in my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">When we came back we had no money, we had no food and we just had the clothes on our backs.</sentence><sentence id="75">Our neighbors had stripped our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was used by neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="76">We recognized some of our clothes that was worn by some of our neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="77">But no one came, no one offered and no one asked.</sentence><sentence id="78">What we had to do was go and dig for potatoes in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">Gather some potatoes and whatever we could from the harvest.</sentence><sentence id="80">And this is what we lived on for quite awhile.</sentence><sentence id="81">And I knew my father was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but I did not know where.</sentence><sentence id="82">And I could have never found him, except that he found me.</sentence><sentence id="83">My dad had -- after the war, my dad had contacted some of the neighbors that he remembered and he wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, looking for his family, looking for survivors.</sentence><sentence id="84">And I had gotten a letter through the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span>, from my dad and gotten his address and was able to get in touch with him.</sentence><sentence id="85">And he was able to send me American dollars through the letters that came.</sentence><sentence id="86">A five dollar bill, a 10 dollar bill -- which we were selling on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">At that time an American money, we were getting a lot for it, because the money in Europe was really devalued at that particular time, so we were able to buy food after awhile.</sentence><sentence id="88">We were also getting clothes through -- I believe it's the United Restitutio -- I don -- I don't know, it was called Unrah.</sentence><sentence id="89">I don't know what it stands for, actually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: And we were getting clothes from them and I remember getting packages and opening the packages and getting clothes that was actually used already and getting shoes that</sentence><sentence id="137">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 6 didn't fit and looking for the candy that was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and we were getting gum.</sentence><sentence id="138">And we would open the package of gum and didn't know that we were supposed to chew this gum and chew it, you know, we just ate it like candy, thinking, "Gee, this is kind of funny candy," you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: You'd never seen gum before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: [had never seen gum before.</sentence><sentence id="147">And we stayed in my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until some of the organiza -- some of the young people were able to get it -- in touch with some of the organizations and some of them were getting help in other ways.</sentence><sentence id="148">And I was able to get in touch with my dad.</sentence><sentence id="149">And then the <span class="DLF">borders</span> closed.</sentence><sentence id="150">And I had gotten caught on the side of <span class="COUNTRY">Communism</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">Both my aunt and I had gotten caught on the side of Communism and we were not able to leave.</sentence><sentence id="152">And I was not able to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that point, or get in touch with my dad any longer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Can I s-stop you here one second?</sentence><sentence id="161">You said the <span class="DLF">borders</span> closed, do you remember what year that was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: No, I don't.</sentence><sentence id="165">Actually, I don't remember the year -- the exact year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Why don't we leave your story where it is at the moment, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> have closed.</sentence><sentence id="169">I -- if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to go back a couple steps and ask you about a -- a couple things you've -- you've mentioned already.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: And bring out a little more detail.</sentence><sentence id="175">First of all, could you just tell us th-this aunt that your -- you've mentioned, could you tell us her name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="181"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0020 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="183">She was my dad's sister and she's the only one that survived on my dad's side, actually, and her name was Freida Weiss.</sentence><sentence id="184">And eventually, she was also able to make her way to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">My aunt had my dad, who was a brother and she had two other brothers living in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and through them she was able to make her way to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: And in your video interview, you talk about her and she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with you and you tell that story.</sentence><sentence id="191">I'd like to go back to -- oh, sorry --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: No, the -- my aunt that I speak of in the video was my mother's sister.</sentence><sentence id="193">The aunt that I'm speaking of now was my father's sister.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: The aunt that I spoke of in the video had not survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">We were separated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she was taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I had found out years later, through someone that knew her and was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with her, that she lived to see liberation.</sentence><sentence id="198">The day she -- the day her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated, she was still alive and died that day, the day the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="199">But, I think of her often, because she was my inspiration all through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">She was the one that kept telling me every single day, "We will make it and tomorrow will be better."</sentence><sentence id="201">I made it, she did not.</sentence><sentence id="202">But I couldn't have done it without her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What was her name?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="219"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0020 8</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: She -- we were separated.</sentence><sentence id="221">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together and then we were separated.</sentence><sentence id="222">I was taken to -- actually, what happened was that our -- our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was emptied and we were put into a <span class="BUILDING">holding barrack</span> and our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and we knew it.</sentence><sentence id="223">My -- they had a separation, my aunt was chosen to go onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to be taken somewhere's else and the last she saw of me was walking towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">And when she left me, she did not think that I had survived, she thought that we had all gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, her entire family and she really did not fight for her life at that point.</sentence><sentence id="225">So, possibly, if she had known some of us had survived, she maybe too, could have survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: And you -- what you tell in your video, it's a remarkable story, you actually were in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span>, I believe, of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: They -- people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, after they were in the camp for, I believe, probably an hour, they knew about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">You know, one separation had taken place and once we were taken into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and once we started to ask about our families, what had happened to our families, the people that had been in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> prior to us coming there, the prisoners, would point to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">This is how we found out what had happened to millions of others, to the children that we were separated from, to our parents, to the rest of our family, by just -- they would just raise their hand and they would tell us to look at the smoke.</sentence><sentence id="237">And of course, this is how we found out about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">We lived with it day in and day out we lived with the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">We watched the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming in, we watched the separations, we watched</sentence><sentence id="241">ontectnetbnancedjusietneey for tarher biormatberabouttfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0020 9 people marching to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, but there was no way we could help them or do anything.</sentence><sentence id="242">So, we learned -- we learned every single day, twice a day, there was a thing called a pell, where we all had to line up to be counted.</sentence><sentence id="243">When they called a pell in the morning and at night, nobody wanted to be in the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, or at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, cause there was always punishment.</sentence><sentence id="244">People were always pulled from the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> or the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Sometimes from the center, but basically, it was easier to pull from the beginning or the end.</sentence><sentence id="246">So everybody fought to be in the center of the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and there were only so many middles, somebody had to be in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="247">Because my aunt was on this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, leaving, I had -- was hoping I could go with her and so I was at the very end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and she watched all of us marching into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">And in the very last moment, six of us were pulled out and put onto another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to do s -- go to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to do slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="249">But her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had pulled away already and she did not see me not walking into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, so she assumed that I too had gone into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> with the rest.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="269">And do you know if she ever knew whether you had survived?</sentence><sentence id="270">Did word ever reach her somehow?</sentence><sentence id="271">Do you have any way of knowing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: [have no way of knowing, but I believe she did not know, because the people that were with her, that told us that they knew her and she had died, remember her speaking about everyone being killed one way or another or going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">So I -- lam assuming she did not know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: And do you know the day she died, which was the day when her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Yeah, no, no, not the date, but it was the day the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated that she died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="289">Was that because of just, you know, illness or that she was in a run down condition, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: She was ill.</sentence><sentence id="291">She had gotten an infection in an -- in a leg -- is -- from what we had heard, and blood poisoning had set in her leg and at that point she really didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="292">She - - you know, when -- when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, there -- there came a point, during a low moment maybe or when hope was lost, where people didn't care whether they lived or died, especially if they knew no one else survived, they just didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="293">And at that point, I believe that she didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="294">I don't know how else to express this, except that I -- I believe that she felt she was the last one of the family and -- and she too gave up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Sorry to bring this up, but something just came on, is that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air conditioning</span>, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Maybe.</sentence><sentence id="302">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="303">Could be the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">I don't know how to shut it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="306">You never turn that off, huh?</sentence><sentence id="307">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="308">Occasional noises you might hear in the background, they're <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">household appliances</span> that can't be shut off.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="315">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="318">But it's hot in here and we need the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air conditioner</span>, guys.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="322">All right, we'll just go -- we'll go along with that.</sentence><sentence id="323">So -- do you -- you were -- do you remember -- did you even have time much, to have much of a reaction when they suddenly pulled you away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and sent you in another direction?</sentence><sentence id="324">Can you remember what you felt or was it just so hectic that --</sentence></p></dialogue>
