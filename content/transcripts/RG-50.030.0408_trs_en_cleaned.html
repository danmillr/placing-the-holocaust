<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: Tell me, what was your full name at birth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: Well, actually, it was Jean, J-e-a-n. Jean Ernest Dolibois, pronounced Dolibois in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> because it is a -- a French name.</sentence><sentence id="7">My father is Parisian -- Parisian ancestry, so in -- in Europe it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dolibois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dolibois</span> like <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, it makes it a lot easier, so that's just a -- but a -- when I became naturalized, I paid a dollar extra for the naturalization fee, to change the Jean, J-e-a-n, which would be pronounced Jean, to John, J-o-h-n. So at least my first name is still a -- Americanized.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: And tell me what year you were born and where in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg City</span>, actually a s-s -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb Bonava</span>, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxembourg City</span>, on the <span class="DLF">avenue</span> -- on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rue de Chicago</span>, predestination apparently.</sentence><sentence id="15">And the -- I was born on December fourth, 1918.</sentence><sentence id="16">My -- was immediately after -- shortly after the signing of the armistice and I was born the youngest of eight children.</sentence><sentence id="17">Unfortunately my mother died 10 days later.</sentence><sentence id="18">So my oldest sister Marie had to step in and -- and play the role of my mother.</sentence><sentence id="19">And she actually raised me.</sentence><sentence id="20">In fact, up until the day she died, I called her mom, you know, she was -- al-although she was my sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: That's interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: But she actually is involved in my coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as an immigrant.</sentence><sentence id="31">I don't know if you want to hear that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: Yeah, I do, I do, yes, I kn --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: -- romantic story, because it is that.</sentence><sentence id="36">Well after World War I, we did have American occupation troops in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- the Americans had liberated <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> from four years of occupation by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="37">So there were American troops stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and some Americans were billeted in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">And as things would happen, my sister was 19 years old, fell in love with one of the Americans, and they planned to get married, if -- when he got out of the service.</sentence><sentence id="39">But then I was born, my mother died, and my sister had to take care of the rest of the family and play the role of mother.</sentence><sentence id="40">So the American came back empty handed, but they corresponded with each other for 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="41">He came back in 1929 and married her and brought her to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akron</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">Meanwhile my brothers and si -- brothers and sisters had all grown up and married, and my father and I were all alone.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">So my father, who had pretty good political sense, and could look across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mosselle river</span> and see what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he didn't see much of a future for -- for me, at least, in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and he thought history could repeat itself, so he decided we ought to get out, come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and take advantage of the land of opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="44">And so my father and I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 1931 --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Let me ask you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: -- and joined my sister now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="49">It's quite a story about your sister --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: -- I must say, 10 years of correspondence that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: -- I'm sure is a rare -- rare story.</sentence><sentence id="61">I -- 1 -- I understand from your autobiography that your -- your dad and you were quite different and your interest in education did not match his interest, is that true?</sentence><sentence id="62">Was that difficult?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Yeah, my -- my father, who was a -- a very loving father and I respected him greatly, and -- and love him dearly, but he was not what we think of as a dad in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, there.</sentence><sentence id="67">There was no such thing as going to a ballgame or even going on vacation.</sentence><sentence id="68">I don't remember my father ever taking me on a vacation trip or anything.</sentence><sentence id="69">He worked -- he worked hard, he was in the <span class="BUILDING">construction business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">But we had eight children, I was the -- the youngest of the eight and my father had been quite successful in business.</sentence><sentence id="71">All of my brothers, with one exception, all worked for my father.</sentence><sentence id="72">They all went into the building trade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and each one of them had a specialty and they worked in my father's company.</sentence><sentence id="73">And naturally that's what was in store for me.</sentence><sentence id="74">Well, for some reason or other I had different ideas, I'm -- I had ambitions.</sentence><sentence id="75">So when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> my father resisted my interest in having an education, and he -- he liked to point out that he never went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and he never even went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, and he was a success in life, why did I want to waste my time?</sentence><sentence id="76">And he had peculiar ideas, and -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="77">Don't read so much, you" ll ge -- you" lI ruin your eyes.</sentence><sentence id="78">And he didn't even want me to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> because he said it was a useless article, y-you pump your legs off to give your rear end a ride, you know.</sentence><sentence id="79">But he had very narrow views about that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="80">But strangely enough, when I insisted and followed my own <span class="DLF">path</span>, he was the first one to step up front and point with pride.</sentence><sentence id="81">And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">He -- he took upon himself to let everybody know that -- when I became a valedictorian in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, he -- he patted himself on the back, too, it's -- it's a --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Do you think he was frightened in some way of the difference that -- how you were different from --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Of -- that's absolute -- that's absolutely right, he -- he -- he never adapted.</sentence><sentence id="106">And he made the sacrifice, coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, for my sake.</sentence><sentence id="107">And I've always given him credit for that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="111">But he never assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="112">He never wanted to be part of the -- he -- he didn't even bother to learn the language.</sentence><sentence id="113">He wanted to just remain what -- what he was.</sentence><sentence id="114">And proud of it.</sentence><sentence id="115">But -- and so I didn't fit that pattern, right, I created a pattern of my own.</sentence><sentence id="116">And naturally, with his old fashioned, basically European viewpoint, he just didn't -- didn't see that.</sentence><sentence id="117">He couldn't agree with that.</sentence><sentence id="118">I mean, we didn't have any arguments about it, but he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da -- you don't need to do that, I never did it, look at me.</sentence><sentence id="119">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: And did your sister support your -- your doing what --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Oh yeah, she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own, because I -- I was - - made perfectly clear that I wasn't going to sponge off of my sister and her family.</sentence><sentence id="122">She had her - - her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline.</sentence><sentence id="123">And -- so it was still possible to do it in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Did your dad work when he came over here, or did he stop working?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, he wa -- he was really -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="130">But he did work around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">He would, you know, repair things for -- for people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing, and -- but we sold our family homestead -- our <span class="BUILDING">family home</span>, and my father could pretty much live on that.</sentence><sentence id="132">He -- he was up in years, he was a --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: -- see, well it's the 50 -- he was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: 1872.</sentence><sentence id="147">Right, so he wasn't such a young --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: So, he was retired.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: And so.</sentence><sentence id="152">But he did manage to keep busy around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akron</span> and earn some pocket money and so forth, but there was never a -- never any want, I mean --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: So he never learned English?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: He never learned English?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: No, no, it -- he could -- he'd read the paper, at least he pretended to read, and he kept pretty much informed of what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="161">But there was a <span class="BUILDING">German church</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akron</span> that he went to.</sentence><sentence id="162">At least one sermon was preached in German in <span class="BUILDING">Saint Bernard church</span>, I recall.</sentence><sentence id="163">So he kept up his contacts that way, and he subscribed to a -- a Luxembourg paper and a German paper.</sentence><sentence id="164">He could read German.</sentence><sentence id="165">Although he was born in f -- in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, his French was not very good.</sentence><sentence id="166">He was primarily Germanic because his family had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to the Saar Basin, at the time that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saar</span> was still a part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Of course, the Saar went back and forth and one time German, then it was independent, and then it was again part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">So in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saar</span> almost everybody spoke French and German, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: But my father primarily spoke the Saar dialect, which is very close to the Luxembourg patois.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Did you like -- did you like the idea of coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence><sentence id="188">Were you happy about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Well, I think -- you know, I wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> were American movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson.</sentence><sentence id="192">And the idea of cowboys and Indians appealed to me.</sentence><sentence id="193">There's an author that every boy in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and for that matter, I think in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> reads as a boy and those are a series of novels about the American Indians and cowboys, written by Karl May.</sentence><sentence id="194">And everybody has read Karl May, as I did.</sentence><sentence id="195">And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life was like in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">That part appealed to me very much, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, and the idea of also leaving all my friends, and the culture that I was used to in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, that created some problems, so I had a conflict.</sentence><sentence id="197">I was excited in one <span class="NPIP">way</span>, and another way a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it.</sentence><sentence id="208">So the -- I didn't want to leave, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Wh-When you came here in "31, it's two years prior to the Nazis taking over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="210">When they take over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, does that impact you at all?</sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, you're still European in some way, so the consciousness of what's going on in Europe --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Oh, I think I was too young to be aware of -- of really what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="213">I don't think that I became particularly interested in what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="214">Wa -- once we got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, I did, I think, what I now think every immigrant should do.</sentence><sentence id="215">First of all concentrate on learning the language, and I -- I couldn't speak a word of English, so I had work pretty hard, because I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, and they immediately sent me back two years.</sentence><sentence id="216">I should have been in the eighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, but before that I -- they put me in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">And here I am 13 years old, and I'm in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, the biggest boy in class, but that was the only advantage.</sentence><sentence id="220">But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and then a couple of more months in the third grade.</sentence><sentence id="221">And then moved me up to, finally, the sixth grade, and I went on from there.</sentence><sentence id="222">But I think I concentrated on becoming a Boy Scout, and becoming Americanized, and I -- I loved the Boy Scout experience.</sentence><sentence id="223">That contributed a great deal to my Americanization.</sentence><sentence id="224">And learning the language was -- was a challenge.</sentence><sentence id="225">And as I say, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential to become a part of the American scene, you know, you should.</sentence><sentence id="226">So I didn't -- I really sort of forgot all about <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and -- to the point where even corresponding with my friends became secondary and I didn't do much of it any more.</sentence><sentence id="227">That all came back later, see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="246">But all of your brothers and sisters, except for Marie, are -- are in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: One more brother had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: So was there some concern then, when the war started in "39 --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Very much so, and of course, after the war started, there was no communication, and no mail, we couldn't get any.</sentence><sentence id="261">After the -- the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, mail service to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was just unheard of.</sentence><sentence id="262">The only way -- I think once or twice we did get some communication from one of my brothers, because somebody who was going to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, mailed a letter for him, I -- I do recall my -- my father getting a letter once from my brother Heinrich that way.</sentence><sentence id="263">But there was no communication.</sentence><sentence id="264">N-No such thing as transatlantic telephone</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="274">calls, and -- and the mail service was nonexistent.</sentence><sentence id="275">But there th -- there's definitely a -- a cessation of communication.</sentence><sentence id="276">There was just no -- no way of being in touch, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: So when did you gra -- you graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> when, in "38, deg39?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: 738?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="283"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akron</span> -- Akron North High School.</sentence><sentence id="284">That --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: So then the question is w-well now what?</sentence><sentence id="286">Because now you have to pave the way for the next step [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Well, I had -- as I say, I had pretty much made up my mind, and -- and -- and this is a -- again, the -- the a -- the hero worship that we're all guilty of in our youth, and I had picked my hero.</sentence><sentence id="288">He was a scout executive, a camp director.</sentence><sentence id="289">My favorite <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a boy was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">scout camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Manatoc</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akron</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, that I attended regularly.</sentence><sentence id="290">In fact, I remember my junior year in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, I spent more nights at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> than I did in my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">But I loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Manatoc</span>, an -- an -- an ideal <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">boy scout camp</span>, and the man who was camp director of it, was just the -- he was my idol.</sentence><sentence id="292">He was the kind of man I wanted to be in every way.</sentence><sentence id="293">Tall, and handsome and -- and a beautiful singing voice, a speaking voice.</sentence><sentence id="294">A lot of personality and that is what I wanted to be like.</sentence><sentence id="295">And I decided I would be a professional scout executive so I could be like Mr. Josselle and follow in that -- that pattern.</sentence><sentence id="296">So naturally that meant an education and going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and my ambition was to get a college degree and go into professional scouting.</sentence><sentence id="297">And I had the audacity at that time to write to the chief scout executive, Dr. James E. West, I recall at that time, professional scout executive.</sentence><sentence id="298">And they answered my letter, and we started up a correspondence.</sentence><sentence id="299">He s -- sort of became my -- my mentor by mail, encouraging me on what to study in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and preparing myself for a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="303">professional career in scouting.</sentence><sentence id="304">So that was my idea.</sentence><sentence id="305">Well, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">scout camp</span> I met some of the younger leaders, who were students at <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">And there was also one who was a -- a graduate of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and Jefferson College in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">And both of these interests, they started recruiting me for their particular <span class="BUILDING">institution</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">And I did get a scholarship at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jefferson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">And it was worth a lot more financially than another scholarship I had at <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span>, so I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and Jefferson.</sentence><sentence id="310">And I would graduate and then go to the Schiff scout reservation and become a professional scout executive.</sentence><sentence id="311">That was my ambition.</sentence><sentence id="312">Then I fell in love and -- during the summer of 1938, I met the young lady whom I subsequently married.</sentence><sentence id="313">And we decided during our summer romance that we would go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="314">And that meant going to a co<span class="BUILDING">-educational school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: You switched.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="317">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jefferson</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">male school</span>, all male.</sentence><sentence id="318">So I ended up taking the scholarship from <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span> because then we can go together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1346">Let's talk about that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1347">A: Well, yeah I -- I don't -- I don't think -- well, maybe -- maybe I'm -- I'm the savior of the -- the mares anyway, not the stallion.</sentence><sentence id="1348">There are two stories about the Lipizzaner horses and they always get mixed up.</sentence><sentence id="1349">Walt Disney got them all -- got it all mixed up in his, "Miracle of the White Stallion."</sentence><sentence id="1350">But I'm in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movie</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1355">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1357">A: Yes, but now identified -- the role in -- in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movie</span> actually did happen that way and -- and I was involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="1358">I had arrived there with my driver on a search for -- actually I was looking for Heisenberg, you know, Heisenberg the physicist Nobel prize winner.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And our Manhattan project people were convinced that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was working on an atom bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And they wanted to know what Friedisch and Weisecker, and what Heisenberg had done and how far they had gotten.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And the truth of it all is that the Germans really were not working on an atomic bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1362">They weren't, but we didn't know that, so we were looking for people who knew something about Heisenberg, and von Weisecker and atomic research and if nothing else it gave me an excuse to go hither and yon, and go everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1363">So anyhow, that's who I was supposedly looking for and it -- and I managed to be where the 16" armored division was, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hofe</span> and [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, right near the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I was the only one at -- and there was a s -- a second armored</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1368">8 cavalry regiment which was heading in that particular <span class="REGION">sector</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And the colonel who was in -- in charge of that particular battalion couldn't speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1370">But one evening I was playing cards with somebody and they need an interpreter and the colonel sent for me and I went over to interpret for him, the reason being that a German captain had voluntarily surrendered and was brought before the colonel to be interrogated and he -- the colonel couldn't talk to him because he couldn't speak German, so I was called in to be the interpreter and Disney does have that scene in the movie.</sentence><sentence id="1371">The colonel is actually eating his dinner and when the prisoner is brought in and I do the interrogating.</sentence><sentence id="1372">In the movie the prisoner tells the colonel about a <span class="DLF">horse farm</span>, but that didn't -- that -- that wasn't the case at all.</sentence><sentence id="1373">He was telling the colonel about dienst stella ost, <span class="BUILDING">service station</span> east, translation.</sentence><sentence id="1374">Which is a military intelligence unit, German military intelligence unit, very much like ours, detailed interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="1375">This was a German intelligence unit gathering information about the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1376">And they were in a hunting lodge in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bohemian forest</span>, just halfway between the <span class="DLF">border</span> and Pilgrin, and they were interrogating German -- I mean, Russian PW, who had information of a strategic nature, like we were doing on our side.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1377">This unit had been in existence for five years and they had maps of every <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, of every <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, of every installation, every weapon, anything you wanted to know about the Soviet army, they had it.</sentence><sentence id="1378">The Soviets were about five miles to the east of them, the Americans about five miles to the west of them, they were in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="1379">Now what should they do?</sentence><sentence id="1380">Do nothing, Soviets might get there first.</sentence><sentence id="1381">If they find out what the Germans had been doing there, it'd be their heads.</sentence><sentence id="1382">They could just destroy everything they had and take to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, but that wouldn't be German.</sentence><sentence id="1383">They're not going to destroy anything they've been gathering for five years.</sentence><sentence id="1384">So their third option was to surrender to the Americans before the Soviets would get there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1385">So this captain voluntarily came to our unit and surrendered and told my colonel all about his</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1389">9 dienst stella ost.</sentence><sentence id="1390">They wanted to surrender to us and turn over to us all of the documentation and all of the interrogation reports, maps and everything they had about the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1391">So they needed a German speaking officer and I was the only one there, so the colonel said, you know, "Doli, your -- you go in, we'll arrange this."</sentence><sentence id="1392">So we had a two and a half ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and driver and enlisted man guard and then the sergeant and I in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> -- and sergeant [indecipherable] the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and I in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> with my driver and we drove into this <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1393">It was an air force colonel -- Luftwaffe colonel, a lieutenant colonel, actually, who was the commander of this unit, Holters was his name and he made a big show, a very formal first wor -- World War I general staff officer, with a surrender s -- the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="1394">We loaded all the stuff on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and there were just a few officers and enlisted men and they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with the documents and the colonel got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> with me and then we drove back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1395">The whole thing didn't take more than about 20 minutes.</sentence><sentence id="1396">But on the way Colonel Holters told me -- asked me if I knew anything about horses.</sentence><sentence id="1397">And I didn't know a thing about horses.</sentence><sentence id="1398">Well, particularly he wanted to know if I knew anything about the Lipizzaner horses.</sentence><sentence id="1399">And I didn't know anything about them either.</sentence><sentence id="1400">So he proceeded to tell me about <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span>, and the history of the <span class="BUILDING">Lipizzaner</span>, very fascinating.</sentence><sentence id="1401">And then I found out the purpose of it all was to tell me that there was a -- a gut -- stut -- stud -- <span class="DLF">stud farm</span> under the German department of agriculture, which had been brought to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- I forget the name of the owner of the <span class="REGION">estate</span> now, Arco whatever it was, located just in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, sort of a equivalent to a <span class="REGION">bluegrass region</span>, which particularly fertile grass and particularly good <span class="REGION">region</span> to breed horses.</sentence><sentence id="1402">And the German Department of Agriculture had brought these mares and some stallions and other horses of a different breed, Caucasians and some were from the Russian steppes.</sentence><sentence id="1403">About 200 horses, but primarily Lipizzaners for breeding purposes to this <span class="DLF">stud farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1404">And they were just about two miles south of where w -- two</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1408">0 kilometers south of where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1409">And he told me all about this, so when he explained the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> to me, I -- I just felt well, we ought to get involved here.</sentence><sentence id="1410">So we took a <span class="DLF">detour</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1411">I sent a sergeant and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with the other prisoners, and documents and everything on, and we took a little detour and this how we came upon this <span class="DLF">stud farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And th-the -- they -- there were all the lipi -- my first look at Lipizzaner horses, a beautiful sight.</sentence><sentence id="1413">This is in May, and the meadow was in bloom and everything else is just beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And I had learned enough about the horses to really appreciate this.</sentence><sentence id="1415">There were some young horses who were frolicking in -- in the <span class="DLF">meadow</span> and doing things that is officially described as airs above the ground, which are the things that we train the stallions to do -- I mean we -- they trained the stallions to do at the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> and wherever they have Lipizzaner horses, there are two <span class="DLF">farms</span> here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where they train lipid -- breed and train Lipizzaners.</sentence><sentence id="1416">Anyhow, these foals -- th- these horses we-were -- were doing these things naturally.</sentence><sentence id="1417">The trick is to teach them to do it on command.</sentence><sentence id="1418">And that was the beauty of this development that I saw.</sentence><sentence id="1419">Anyhow, the point was that I had the opportunity to -- to meet Colonel Potisky, who was the leader of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span>, who happened to be there at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="1420">Well, to make a long story short, from the <span class="DLF">stud farm</span>, once I saw it, I took some pictures and I went on back then, reported to Colonel Reed what I had seen.</sentence><sentence id="1421">He had a brother who -- who had performed an e -- an eques -- equestrian of the Olympics.</sentence><sentence id="1422">And he went riding a horse that was named Potisky in honor of Colonel Potisky of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1423">So he knew all about them.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And I said, "Well, there's a <span class="DLF">stud farm</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1425">Here we are and -- so he took over.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And we had German PW and a lot of Polish DPs who were in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, who then helped some of our American forces move the horses back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because the fear was that the ri -- Soviets would get there first, and they would eat them, because the rumor, and it's -- I guess it was true, too, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1430">1 the Soviets tried to get those horses to use them to pull <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and the Lipizzaners wouldn't respond, so they ji -- but-butchered them.</sentence><sentence id="1431">And so they were afraid this what would happen to the <span class="BUILDING">Lipizzaner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1432">Plus the fact that the Polish DPs didn't like the Germans, and they would take care of the Lipizzaners also if they got a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1433">So we rescued them, we -- we brought them.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Some of the stallions were there, but mostly they were the -- the mares and the foals and some of the other horses.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And we moved them across into a sector of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwartzburg</span>, which is in the command of the second armored cavalry regiment.</sentence><sentence id="1436">That's the story that I was involved in.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1437">Meanwhile, at about the same time, General Walker of the 20" corps came into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to St.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1438">Martin in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crise</span>, and came to an <span class="DLF">estate</span> there which they set up as their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, where the stallions of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had been brought by Colonel Potisky.</sentence><sentence id="1439">And colonel -- General Walker was quite impressed and knowing that Patton was a horse lover and cavalryman, notified Patton, who was at that time I think in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1440">And Patton and the deputy secretary of war, who was visiting the front at that time, got into Patton's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and they flew to <span class="BUILDING">Saint Martin's</span> and the stallions from the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> put on a show for Patton -</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1441">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1442">A: -- with the result that Patton put the Lipizzaners under the protection of the United States army, all Lipizzaners, which included the ones from the <span class="DLF">stud farm</span>, who were included in that general order.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Nobody could touch the Lipizzaner horses who were under the protection of the United States army, because Patton was quite impressed with them.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And it turned out that he had wid -- ridden in the Olympics in 1912 against Colonel Potisky.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And the most famous quote to me, a Patton quote is -- I don't have the exact quote, but he was quite peevishly concerned that why the Austrians used 57 healthy, well-trained men to teach horses how to dance, when they</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1449">2 should be at the front fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1450">I mean, that was the gist of it.</sentence><sentence id="1451">Imagine these guys teaching horses to dance instead of fighting for their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1452">But nevertheless he -- he did protect the horses, and -- so Patton really is the liberator of the Lipizzaners.</sentence><sentence id="1453">And that's the Disney story.</sentence><sentence id="1454">Now Disney had the whole thing --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1455">Q:

really, it was a very peaceful operation, but a great adventure.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And the sequel was that my pattern of circles again, is that 50 years later, my wife and I were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span>, to see a performance there.</sentence><sentence id="1458">And we had our youngest son Brian with us.</sentence><sentence id="1459">And we couldn't get any tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1460">It was the opening performance, September 12" and they were all sold out.</sentence><sentence id="1461">Nobody could get me any tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And consequently, I had a photograph and I brought some of the photographs with me of Colonel Potisky and myself shaking hands, with a Lipizzaner standing next to us.</sentence><sentence id="1463">So I -- very brash, I wrote a letter to Colonel Potisky, commandant of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I included that picture.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And told him, you know, this is me, and [indecipherable] the incident of our -- our -- our visit and said that I was trying to get tickets for the opening performance and if he could possibly help me I would appreciate it, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I didn't hear from him until about a week before we left for Europe on our vacation trip.</sentence><sentence id="1466">I got a letter from the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish riding school</span>, not from Colonel Potisky, saying that he had retired, he's on a trip around the world, my letter had caught up with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And they had tickets for the three of us to come to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1516">A: And that was -- and that's 50 years after this particular incident, so it had a special meaning.</sentence><sentence id="1517">That -- that's the Lipizzaner story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1520">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1521">Your next assignment, I gather, is to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Palace Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span>, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1524">A: The war is over, in fact the war ended, unbeknownst to me at the time, this unit of the dienst stella ost, Colonel Holters and two of his officers -- we decided to send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span>, and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> to our special service sta -- our own detailed <span class="BUILDING">interrogation center</span>, our own <span class="BUILDING">service station</span> in the Ardenst, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1525">And meanwhile my driver and I headed back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1529">4 and I continued on that particular project for about a week or so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>, of Colonel Holters and -- and his staff.</sentence><sentence id="1530">And it was a wonderful time because we got back the day the war ended, got back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1531">And the next day we had a victory parade, full dress uniform, just my unit, 6824DIC, we had a drummer who played the drum, no -- no band, orchestra, and an American flag, and we got all dressed up, officers and enlisted men, and we had a parade right through Revan, and th-the French people cheering us on, viva l'Amerique.</sentence><sentence id="1532">And it was a great -- a great victory.</sentence><sentence id="1533">And the next week or two I had a wonderful time going down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rans</span> for the opera, and interrogating -- finishing the job of Colonel Holters.</sentence><sentence id="1534">Then we ran into trouble cause our war department wasn't interested in having that information about Soviet Union, cause that was our - - they were our allies.</sentence><sentence id="1535">And so there was a resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And then the fact my commanding officer was -- supposedly I heard, reprimanded for either -- either -- for even gathering this information.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1537">But you probably know the name Bob Lovitt, and Bob Lovitt was a deputy secretary of state, I believe at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1538">And he used his influence and eventually Colonel Holters, the two officers, and all the documents we -- we captured in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bohemian forest</span> were brought to this secret location here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1539">And that's the end of that relationship, that's all I knew about.</sentence><sentence id="1540">My commanding officer called me in and said I had a new assignment, and our detailed <span class="BUILDING">interrogation center</span> was going to be dissolved and I was going to go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that he had never heard of before, and that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1541">Meanwhile, I had made one trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> on a special assignment to go back and see if I could locate any of my family.</sentence><sentence id="1542">So this transfer to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> came as a real surprise.</sentence><sentence id="1543">In fact, I had -- I had no idea there were even Americans stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1544">I assumed, of course, but I hadn't pursued that.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So that was a real assignment, to get back into <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1546">And that assignment was to the central prisoner of war enclosure number 32, which was also coded in our orders as Ashcan.</sentence><sentence id="1547">That was the code word</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1551">5 that they used, send us to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1552">And that's all I knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I had no idea what the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, what it was used for or what I'd be doing.</sentence><sentence id="1554">All I know is I was transferred.</sentence><sentence id="1555">The good news was that my best friend and colleague, Malcolm Hilkey, with whom I had been at -- at-at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and -- and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and also at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>, was going to the same <span

class="REGION">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1557">So I would be with old friends and -- and ready for whatever they had in store for me.</sentence><sentence id="1558">So I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, my second visit, this time on official assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1559">There was a lot of talk when the war ended that we were now going to go to the far east in military intelligence, and I anticipated that that's probably what would happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="1560">But instead I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, which to me was a miracle, and which shouldn't have happened that way, but I didn't question it.</sentence><sentence id="1561">So I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1562">I knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span> because I had gone there with my brother Heinrich who is married, when I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> as a boy.</sentence><sentence id="1563">And he and his wife had taken me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span> on occasion.</sentence><sentence id="1564">There was a little <span

this <span class="BUILDING">resort</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span> was a -- a <span class="DLF">spa</span>, mineral water and health resort health spa.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And I knew the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I was assigned to, that was the <span class="BUILDING">palace hotel</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1566">Four story <span

facilities for <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> for -- for a <span class="BUILDING">health resort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">So I reported there and then I found it -- it had changed quite a lot from what I remember as a boy.</sentence><sentence id="1569">A <span class="DLF">fence</span> around it, Klieg lights overheard, camouflage material, and [indecipherable] hanging, you know, you couldn't see what was going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1570">There were <span class="BUILDING">machine gun towers</span> on each of the four corners of this <span class="REGION">fenced in area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">And there was a roving guard, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, military police riding around, I think, constantly.</sentence><sentence id="1572">And all I knew is I been transferred to CCPW number 32, I didn't know what was -- what was going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1573">So I asked the sergeant of the guard in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, say what's going on here?</sentence><sentence id="1574">And hi --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1578">6 his answer is very typical of sergeant of the guard, he said, th-the -- "Well," he said, "I've been here three weeks," he said.

noncommissioned officer in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> when I walked in, and he read my orders, and signed me to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1583">He said, "This is where you're going to live, and that's also where you're going to work."</sentence><sentence id="1584">And I asked him, "What kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> is this?"</sentence><sentence id="1585">And he said, "Well, it's an <span class="BUILDING">interrogation center</span>, it's a wa -- interrogating prisoners of war."</sentence><sentence id="1586">So I assumed this is continuation of what we've been doing at the -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Revan</span>, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DIC</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1587">So as I was in -- in the process of unpacking my belongings in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, which was rather sparsely furnished, but comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="1588">And I heard a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I thought this is one of other officers coming in to introduce himself.</sentence><sentence id="1589">So I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and before me stood none other than Herman Goering, the Reichsmarshall of the Third Reich.</sentence><sentence id="1590">So I was the most surprised person in the world, and stood there with my mouth open.</sentence><sentence id="1591">He clicked his heels and says, "Goering, Reichsmarshall."</sentence><sentence id="1592">So I asked him to step <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1593">He was carrying a pair of trousers and he said, "This an extra pair of trousers."</sentence><sentence id="1594">I couldn't understand this, but he, in a smirking fashion -- he had a way of delivering his <span class="DLF">lines</span> with a smirk on his face.</sentence><sentence id="1595">He said, "Well, I wanted to be a model prisoner, and several days ago we were declassified.</sentence><sentence id="1596">We are now ordinary prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1597">And we only permitted a certain amount of clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1598">And I overlooked this particular pair of trousers.</sentence><sentence id="1599">I didn't want to get in trouble, so I want to turn them in to you."</sentence><sentence id="1600">Well, I -- I wasn't quite in tune with what he was leading up to, and then it suddenly dawned on me that he needed an excuse to come and see me and I think he was sacrificing an extra pair of trousers for an excuse.</sentence><sentence id="1601">I didn't know anything about the operation yet, but it ma -- was made clear to me later on.</sentence><sentence id="1602">What he wanted to know is he wanted to know who I</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1606">7 was.</sentence><sentence id="1607">He fancied himself the -- the leader of the group that was imprisoned.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And I didn't know who they were, but I knew now that one of them was Goering.</sentence><sentence id="1609">So it was his business to find out who the newcomers, who the arrivals were.</sentence><sentence id="1610">And he had seen me coming in through the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, so he followed procedure and came to see me, using the trousers as an excuse.</sentence><sentence id="1611">And then he asked me, "What is your particular assignment here?</sentence><sentence id="1612">You're a young man, what are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="1613">I was 26 at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1614">And before I could answer him, he said, "Are you by any chance the welfare officer, who would see to it that we all get treated properly, in accordance with the rules of Geneva convention?"</sentence><sentence id="1615">So I was just going to say no, I'm an interrogation officer, but when he suggested I might be the welfare officer, I said, "Oh yeah, I'm going to see to it that you get treated properly," and he was satisfied.</sentence><sentence id="1616">So he then started a list of complaints.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And he was unhappy with the way he was brought here, that he was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: Wa -- wa -- can we wait just one moment?</sentence><sentence id="1619">Is that [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1620">Okay, I'm sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1621">A: Well he had -- he had decided then -- well, I had decided, rather, that I would see to it that they would all get a square deal.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And he lodged his cam -- ki -- campaign of complaints about he was supposed to go to -- go into exile.</sentence><sentence id="1623">He had brought with him 11 suitcases, with all of his uniforms and decorations and his Reichsmarshall baton, all his belongings.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And he, after all, was the head of the German state, successor to Hitler and he was going to go to -- into exile like Napoleon or any head of state.</sentence><sentence id="1625">Instead they brought him to this very meager <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, with a folding army cot, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span>, and he was very unhappy with that whole arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="1626">And I said well I knew nothing about that.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And that ended our conversation, he clicked his heels and bowed and left.</sentence><sentence id="1628">That evening at five o'clock, I was to report to my commanding officer, to Captain Sensnik.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1629">And I was a first lieutenant at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And I reported to Captain Sensnik and I told him that I had a visitor.</sentence><sentence id="1631">I told him of this particular visit from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goering</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1632">And Captain Sensnik, "That's</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1636">8 great," he said, "that's your cover."</sentence><sentence id="1637">He said, "Every one of us needs a cover, and by the way, use a different name, don't use your name.</sentence><sentence id="1638">You still have relatives in Europe, brothers and sisters, and we don't know what's ahead, but most of us are using different names, so pick a name."</sentence><sentence id="1639">Well, I picked a n -- a name of a -- a good Luxembourg name, Gellen.</sentence><sentence id="1640">Said, "Okay, I'll be John Gellen."</sentence><sentence id="1641">He said, "Okay, that's your name from now on.</sentence><sentence id="1642">All your orders, everything you get will be in the name of John Gellen.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And you pretend to be the welfare officer.</sentence><sentence id="1644">You visit all the prisoners, listen to what they have to say, keep a file of what you hear, and we'll coordinate that with our interrogation reports.</sentence><sentence id="1645">So yi -- ni -- that's your job from now on, that's your cover."</sentence><sentence id="1646">Then he explained to me that all the prisoners were on the third and fourth floor, some two in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, some single <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1647">The <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> was a buffer zone, nothing was happening on that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1648">The first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, where we were -- we were billeted in our <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping rooms</span> and also our <span class="BUILDING">working offices</span>, but we were trying to find private billets outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> so we could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night after work, so we wouldn't be in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1649">The <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, where the prisoners would eat, a <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span> where they could read, under supervision.</sentence><sentence id="1650">If they wore glasses, their glasses were kept on the rack in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span>, they weren't allowed to take their glasses upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="1651">Danger of suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1652">They might break their glasses and cut their wrists, as some of them had tried to do.</sentence><sentence id="1653">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">veranda</span> around the front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where they could sit and sunbathe.</sentence><sentence id="1654">They could actually walk in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, a nice little <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1655">But they had to stay within a <span class="DLF">barb wire enclosure</span> and there's an electric -- electric wire.</sentence><sentence id="1656">I had a picture of that, by the way, of the electric wire, with a German sign warning high voltage so they wouldn't beyond that.</sentence><sentence id="1657">And of course there was a <span class="BUILDING">machine gun tower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1658">Now I have my own theory of why we had this heavy guard around the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1659">None of these people is going to s -- going to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1660">W-We didn't have to worry about that.</sentence><sentence id="1661">We had to worry about the people on</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1664">9 the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> who might want to get at them.</sentence><sentence id="1665">So they were more defense, and guard were more to protect them from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and keep them alive and in good shape for the trials, than otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="1666">Each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was equipped with a folding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cot</span>, straw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>, two or three GI blankets, a four legged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and a bucket of water, and a

official issue, a deodorant soap.</sentence><sentence id="1672">There were no doorknobs on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> because they could use the screws to -- use the sc -- the sharp end of a screw if they wanted to hurt themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1673">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flush toilet</span> were the kind with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> above and the chain, that was removed.</sentence><sentence id="1674">The chain was removed cause they might use the chain.</sentence><sentence id="1675">They were not pu -- permitted to wear belts, neckties, shoestrings -- which was a real problem.</sentence><sentence id="1676">How to keep them in their shoes if they wore hightops without shoestrings.</sentence><sentence id="1677">We had to get special permission and they were allowed four inch shoestrings so they could at least tie the top two <span class="DLF">holes</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="1678">It's kind of humorous and they made much of that when they exercised a little -- a little sense of humor.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1679">They had absolute freedom to move within the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1680">This is how Goering came to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1681">He could see who was going where and follow and knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1682">This was by design.</sentence><sentence id="1683">This -- this helped to stimulate communication.</sentence><sentence id="1684">It allowed them to visit each other, they could go to each other's <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and get involved in discussions and arguments, and get mad at each other and we benefited from that.</sentence><sentence id="1685">That was part of our technique of gathering information.</sentence><sentence id="1686">What did one prisoner say about

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1697">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1699">A: It was very effective.</sentence><sentence id="1700">We -- we did -- we didn't use any what we now consider modern interrogation [indecipherable] like recordings.</sentence><sentence id="1701">There were no secret tapes, definitely no torture devises, I mean we didn't -- thumbscrews or any kind of torture device.</sentence><sentence id="1702">We didn't need it.</sentence><sentence id="1703">They were all willing to talk, a-and they're quite willing to talk.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1709">Q: Why do you think that was so, that they were so willing to talk?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1711">A: First of all, the more they were interrogated, the more important they were, because if -- if you had a lot of interrogations, in the eyes of the other prisoners, the enemy considered you a decision maker, you were obviously one of the top men.</sentence><sentence id="1712">If you were not interrogated at all, which was true of some of the people, I don't know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn't have been there.</sentence><sentence id="1713">Nobody knew who they were.</sentence><sentence id="1714">But they had a uniform on and they happened to be at the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the right time and were taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they were with somebody, if they were in the presence of Goering.</sentence><sentence id="1715">Like his -- his adjutant, or his aid.</sentence><sentence id="1716">They were all taken prisoner, unfortunately because they happened to be Goering's aid, but they had no intelligence value, and they were not permitted to continue to be his aid.</sentence><sentence id="1717">They just became ordinary prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1718">So we -- we had prisoners who -- who -- who just -- we didn't know why they were there, and they didn't know why they were there, and they wanted to be interrogated so they could -- they could at least feel that they were important.</sentence><sentence id="1719">That was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1720">The other thing was none of these prisoners presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none of them worked as part of a team, a united effort to protect each other.</sentence><sentence id="1721">They were all protecting</sentence><sentence id="1723">1 only themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1724">Not a single one ever thought in terms of protecting the German general's staff, or protecting the -- the Nazi element, or the bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we had.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And those were the three categories that automatically they divided themselves into.</sentence><sentence id="1726">The general's staff pretty much stuck together socially in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, in their -- their discussion groups and their cliques.</sentence><sentence id="1727">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="1728">When they sat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">veranda</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span>, or when they ate together, they pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis pretty much stuck together.</sentence><sentence id="1729">And the same thing with the statesmen or the ministers and some of those.</sentence><sentence id="1730">So each one was out to save his own neck.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And they had grievances that went back to Hitler's time, back to 1934 - 35.</sentence><sentence id="1732">If Goering snubbed this particular general, this general now had an opportunity to spill the beans about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goering</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1733">Petty stuff, but this is exactly what we wanted -- w-we wanted to hear.</sentence><sentence id="1734">So the socializing with each other and visiting with each other was all part of a interrogation scheme.</sentence><sentence id="1735">We had a conflict of our own, cause on one hand, there were five of us, five interrogators.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And we belonged to the Richie crowd, we were the trained military intelligence personnel.</sentence><sentence id="1737">We had nothing to do with the operation of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, of how the prisoners were fed, or how they were housed or anything else.</sentence><sentence id="1738">That was under the command of the -- of Colonel Andrews, Burton C. Andrews, of the 391deg anti-tank battalion -- were his personnel.</sentence><sentence id="1739">Andrews actually was brought into this job in charge of this <span class="BUILDING">detention center</span> from a -- a prisoner of war -- not a prisoner of war enclosure, but a regular <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="1740">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">For <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military prison camp</span>, American prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1742">He was in charge of -- of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1743">So he was a trained military warden, and he was in charge of this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1744">We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldiers who were ordinary prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1745">They were the cadre, the work cadre.</sentence><sentence id="1746">They we -- they did the manual labor.</sentence><sentence id="1747">The prisoners didn't do their own cooking or serving of the food or cleaning up, except their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, they had to clean their own <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1748">But they didn't run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sweepers</span>, or -- or do the dusting or anything in</sentence><sentence id="1750">2 the <span class="INT_SPACE">public rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1751">So we had German soldiers who were carpenters, electricians, cooks, bakers, even the chaplain, a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1752">Most anything we needed to run a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1753">But these were ordinary German prisoners who were now in a position to be associated with the -- what they called the bunsin, the big animals who had run the -- the dictatorship under Hitler's regime.</sentence><sentence id="1754">Was quite a -- that interplay was very interesting to watch.</sentence><sentence id="1755">Well then we had the prison guards, the Americans, who supervised all of this, who directed the German PW, who were the work cadre.</sentence><sentence id="1756">And they were responsible for the security and -- and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="1757">Now Colonel Andrews came from a regular <span class="BUILDING">detention center</span>, from a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">We had difficulty convincing him that these were not people who were being punished.</sentence><sentence id="1759">They were people who were being interrogated in preparation for a trial.</sentence><sentence id="1760">And that we needed them in pretty good physical condition and good mental condition in order to get their cooperation while we interrogated them.</sentence><sentence id="1761">But he looked upon them as criminals.</sentence><sentence id="1762">And he was the -- the prison warden.</sentence><sentence id="1763">So if they didn't exactly behave as he thought they should, like if they didn't have their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> very clean, then he would put them in solitary confinement.</sentence><sentence id="1764">They'd stay in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> for 24 hours, or maybe two days if their shoes weren't shined properly.</sentence><sentence id="1765">And we'd say that doesn't help our interrogation, because if they get mad and resentful, then they won't cooperate with us.</sentence><sentence id="1766">So we had that interplay, so -- and we finally had to go pretty high up, as high as Wild Bill Donovan, the commanding general of the -- what was then the OSS, who was our mentor.</sentence><sentence id="1767">He is the one who coached us on how to get information out of the prisoners, he was a -- an expert in that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1768">And Donovan then had to use his general rank to get Colonel Andrews to cooperate with the idea that this was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">processing center</span>, not a center for punishment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1831">Q: We're going to have to stop the tape now --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1832">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1837">Q: -- because we're running out.</sentence><sentence id="1840">4 Beginning Tape Three</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1845">Q: We -- when we completed the last tape, you were talking about the problem with Colonel Andrews --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1846">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Andrews</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1847">Q: -- and his view of the prisoners versus -- or were these prisoners, were these criminals, who were these people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1849">A: Well, he treat -- as far as he was concerned, they were prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And one of my jobs -- Andrews took a personal liking to me, primarily because I knew my way around <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1851">So whenever we had a VIP visitor like General Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher officials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appointed tour guide.</sentence><sentence id="1852">So that became one of my functions.</sentence><sentence id="1853">In addition to what I had to do, I would take them around <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and show them <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1854">Well, Andrews enjoyed that part of it himself because he would always go along and -- and I'd on a couple of occasions invited Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon.</sentence><sentence id="1855">And bourbon was just not available anywhere, except as we got it in our liquor ration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1856">So every once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the few of us officers would get together and have a little party, and we invited Prince Felix to a couple of these affairs, which impressed Colonel Andrews very much.</sentence><sentence id="1857">So we finally got around to the point of where he saw our viewpoint in addition to the official persuasion he got from <span class="NPIP">above</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1858">You know, we can't treat these people like convicted criminals serving their sentences.</sentence><sentence id="1859">We have to try them first, and before we can try them, we had to interrogate them, and -- and that public relations effort helped considerably.</sentence><sentence id="1860">It also resulted in my being at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> when I had done everything possible to avoid going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, cause I was tired of the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="1861">But once I arrived there on temporary duty, Andrews snagged me and he wouldn't let me go because he wanted me back on his staff again.</sentence><sentence id="1864">5 So it had its -- its pluses and minuses.</sentence><sentence id="1865">But he used me also to translate his messages to the -- the prisoners whenever -- for instance, when Streicher arrived, Doenitz refused on behalf of the other prisoners, to eat in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> with Streicher.</sentence><sentence id="1866">Well then Andrews wrote a message to be delivered to them, and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and -- which we told them it -- you have no choice.</sentence><sentence id="1867">I mean, he's your boy and you're going to eat with him whether you like it or not, cause you're all alike.</sentence><sentence id="1868">We're not looking at you as a grand admiral, or you as a Reichsmarshall.</sentence><sentence id="1869">We're looking at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and that's what Streicher is, and you're going to eat in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1870">That -- that's the kind of message that Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding crop that he carried all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1871">High polished boots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin" image of General Patton when it came to dress and bearing and he loved to play the commanding officer, which sometimes the Nazis u-used against all of us in a humorous sense.</sentence><sentence id="1872">For instance, one general, I forget what his name was, had not -- Andrews came walking into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and -- and the general didn't stand up and click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement room</span> which Andrews kept for solitary confinement.</sentence><sentence id="1873">And then he wrote an order that whenever he walked into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> they were to stand up at attention and -- and salute him.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Well, they carried it to the other extreme so whenever any one of us entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> they did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1875">And it got to be sort of humorous, here I was a first lieutenant and if they were all sitting on the vera -- veranda in the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of these guys, and I would come back from lunch and walk it up -- they would all stand up and click their heels and bow, and say good afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And it got to be a joke until they got tired of it, but we had a -- light moments with them too.</sentence><sentence id="1877">But we did convince Andrews finally to let us do our -- our thing, as long as the prisoners didn't violate any of the rules he'd go along with it, but</sentence><sentence id="1879">6 that was one of the challenges.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Other than that, our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of -- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pretended to be the welfare officer.</sentence><sentence id="1881">Well, I was the welfare officer because I made the rounds.</sentence><sentence id="1882">I would go from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I would ask the prisoner how -- how are you today, and at first they were very busy writing letters to General Eisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they were heads of state, or former heads of state.</sentence><sentence id="1883">And they were complaining about their treatment and making demands.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And our job was to translate those letters, send them -- send them out through <span class="DLF">channels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And we never got any replies, I assume they're still going through <span class="DLF">channels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1886">But -- so if they had a letter that they wanted to write to someone, they would give it to me to translate for them, and send it on.</sentence><sentence id="1887">Or if they wanted to locate their family.</sentence><sentence id="1888">You know, I -- I don't know where my wife is, could you try to find out where she is?</sentence><sentence id="1889">And we would, which is very simple thing because for instance, a lot of them lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to them as the bunsin, the big -- the big boys -- a lot of the Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Ma-Many of them had their <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tegernsee</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1891">So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her, we could contact a military unit of ours stationed near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tegernsee</span> and ask them to investigate.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And we got to the point where we could sometimes forward letters.</sentence><sentence id="1893">And that helped tremendously in getting their cooperation and telling me things that -- that we wanted to hear.</sentence><sentence id="1894">So I would make the rounds and -- and somebody would say, I don't have any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an extra ration of toothpaste, shampoo, or I have a dandruff problem.</sentence><sentence id="1895">Goering had a skin problem and he always -- he wanted special lotions and special soaps, which we couldn't furnish, but at least I listened to his complaints and -- and by listening and sympathizing with him, that -- that helped pave the way.</sentence><sentence id="1896">What happened then was that every one of us had a specialty.</sentence><sentence id="1897">I really specialized in the German general's staff.</sentence><sentence id="1898">The history of the German general's staff, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1901">7 So a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategies and organization and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1902">With the result that each one of the five of us would have only a certain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldn't get to know anything about any of the others.</sentence><sentence id="1903">Well, I was the welfare officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even though I never interrogated them.</sentence><sentence id="1904">But I would g-go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing, how do you feel?</sentence><sentence id="1905">And I would end up getting a lot of information that helped my performance, because I kept this gossip file about one s -- prisoner said about the other.</sentence><sentence id="1906">But one in particular stands out, was old Papa Schwartz, Franz Xavier Schwartz, was called Papa Schwartz.</sentence><sentence id="1907">He was the Nazi party treasurer.</sentence><sentence id="1908">Simple, kind old guy, really.</sentence><sentence id="1909">He didn't know what the score was.</sentence><sentence id="1910">But he was a very popular politician in <span

id="1912">And that's all Schwartz did, he collected dues.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And now you think Nazi party treasurer would have been a very important guy, who certainly would have a lot to do with buying property and -- and receiving big contributions.</sentence><sentence id="1914">That wasn't Schwartz's job, that was somebody else's responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="1915">That was Funk, and to a certain extent at first, Schacht.</sentence><sentence id="1916">So Schwartz, I don't even know why we -- we brou -- he was never interrogated.</sentence><sentence id="1917">He really served no particular purpose.</sentence><sentence id="1918">And his son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr.</sentence><sentence id="1919">was the president of <span class="BUILDING">German breweries</span>, which really had no particular connection, but he did have a - - a paramilitary rank in th -- either the SS or the SA.</sentence><sentence id="1920">A lot of people, if you made a big contribution financially, if you were an industrialist, you would got a -- get a rank like a sturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing more than an honorary title, and i -- and you could -- got to wear a uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1921">So if you were president of the <span class="BUILDING">breweries</span>, you could wear a uniform as a brigadier general in the SS, but you really had nothing to do in the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1922">But it did put him in the automatic arrest category, because everybody who was an SS officer was</sentence><sentence id="1924">8 automatically arrested by us.</sentence><sentence id="1925">So we ended up with a lot of these deadbeats.</sentence><sentence id="1926">Well, Schwartz looked very much like my father, physical image.</sentence><sentence id="1927">My father had sort of a white mustache, little [indecipherable] like Hindenburg.</sentence><sentence id="1928">And Schwartz looked like my father and the first time I went in to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because it looked almost like my own papa sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="1929">And he noticed that and wanted to know what -- you know, what made you -- he said -- upshraken was the German word, la -- what made you pull back.</sentence><sentence id="1930">And just in a moment of candor I said, "W-Well, because you look very much like my father."</sentence><sentence id="1931">And then I showed him a picture of my father.</sentence><sentence id="1932">And he -- he started to cry, he got -- he -- he got very emotional about that.</sentence><sentence id="1933">He th -- he thought that was just a wonderful coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="1934">He's -- he's a Roman Catholic, he was very devout, and he thought surely that God had ordained for this to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1935">Well, I -- I had to take advantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a father confessor.</sentence><sentence id="1936">And they would go to Papa Schwartz and tell him things that they didn't tell anybody else, especially after an -- an interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="1937">They were going to Papa Schwartz and say, well they asked me about this, but I told them that, but the truth of the matter is.</sentence><sentence id="1938">Well then, after I showed -- after wa -- won the confidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he'd say, don't trust so and so.</sentence><sentence id="1939">And he would -- he would tell me things about what the prisoner had said to him.</sentence><sentence id="1940">And it was that kind of play that -- that resulted in our getting more information than we really knew how to cope with, in addition to our official interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="1941">We worked for the Nazi war crimes commission, which was headed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be our prosecutor for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1942">And they were located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And -- and this was his staff, th-the general, General Telford Taylor, and Colonel Amon and others who were the assistant prosecutors.</sentence><sentence id="1944">And they would make up questionnaires, what they wanted to know about a certain prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1945">They were preparing the case for the prosecution against, say Karl Doenitz,</sentence><sentence id="1947">9 Grand Admiral Doenitz.</sentence><sentence id="1948">So they had questions about him.</sentence><sentence id="1949">Was he present when this particular treaty was signed?</sentence><sentence id="1950">Was he there when -- at the Wannsee conference when the final solution was decided on?</sentence><sentence id="1951">And then we would get those questionnaires, and then we would have a staff meeting.</sentence><sentence id="1952">And Captain Sensnik would say, okay, we have a questionnaire on Doenitz, Dolibois, you -- you handle that one.</sentence><sentence id="1953">And then I would -- I would get that questionnaire and then I would prepare my interrogation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doenitz</span>, the intent being to get the answers to those questions, but -- but building it around a autobiographical sketch sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And these were very fascinating because the prisoner would brag about his accomplishments, what he had done and everything.</sentence><sentence id="1955">And in the course of that you could work in the pas -- specific questions that colonel -- Justice Jackson wanted answered for his staff.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And this is what made the -- it's kind of a -- a -- an interesting challenge, an interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="1957">Well that was the job of each interrogator.</sentence><sentence id="1958">We'd interrogate and sometimes it would go on for a week, you'd do nothing but interrogate one prisoner, then spend the afternoon writing up your report.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2655">A: Ley was the only one who was sympathetic to Streicher.</sentence><sentence id="2656">So Ley said that he would -- he would be willing to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with Streicher.</sentence><sentence id="2657">But we put Streicher at first into -- into -- on the second floor where there were no other prisoners, because nobody wanted to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him and we didn't have any more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="2658">And then Streicher indicate -- Ley indicated that he'd be willing to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with Streicher, so we put the two together, cause as I say, we had a purpose for wanting them to relate to each other, conversation-wise and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="2659">Ley was very much taken with Streicher, he admired him.</sentence><sentence id="2660">But that feeling wasn't particularly returned on Streicher's part.</sentence><sentence id="2661">He -- he didn't -- Streicher didn't particularly care for Ley, he -- he thought he was a</sentence><sentence id="2663">7 weakling.</sentence><sentence id="2664">He -- he wasn't match -- a masochist like Streicher was.</sentence><sentence id="2665">Streicher was all muscle and - - and show off masochist.</sentence><sentence id="2666">But Ley was just a direct opposite, he was a wimp.</sentence><sentence id="2667">And so Streicher had this tendency to look down on Ley.</sentence><sentence id="2668">But that was the only one -- the only two who -- who were willing to be together.</sentence><sentence id="2669">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> -- course they had to eat together, but they had difficulty finding somebody to -- to sit with them, unless there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and they -- they had to sit with them.</sentence><sentence id="2670">But there was very little conversation between Streicher -- everybody despised him.</sentence><sentence id="2671">I mean, they -- they just didn't care for him, especially Goering, who was the one that filed charges against him, and brought him before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi court</span>, which is -- Walter Buch, who was another one of our prisoners that I didn't mention.</sentence><sentence id="2672">He was the chief justice of the -- of the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi court</span>, you know, the -- when a Nazi committed a crime against another Nazi, he was not tried in a <span class="BUILDING">criminal court</span>, he was tried in a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi court</span>, and Walter Buch was the superior judge of this -- this <span class="BUILDING">Nazi court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2673"><span class="BUILDING">Buch</span>, incidentally, was the father-in-law of Martin Bormann, who was Hitler's adjutant and the guy that pretty much spoke for Hitler and signed a lot of orders that are still today being questioned as to the authenticity, did they come from Bormann or Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="2674">So Bormann was a very important guy, you know, he -- unfortunately we didn't have him with us.</sentence><sentence id="2675">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buch</span> was the father-in-law of this man, too.</sentence><sentence id="2676">Another one that I didn't mention who was part of that Nazi trash [indecipherable] was Wilhelm Frick, who'd been sec -- Minister of the Interior and was really the guy who wrote the -- the original Nuremberg laws.</sentence><sentence id="2677">The -- the law -- the legal --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2678">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2679">A: -- phrase -- phrases themselves, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2680">Q: Let's stop the tape now since it's going to run out soon, and go to the next tape.</sentence><sentence id="2683">8 Beginning Tape Four</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2692">A: He was a nonentity, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="2693">And even the Nazis considered him a -- a nobody.</sentence><sentence id="2694">He was powerful because, you know, the Minister of the Interior in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, even today in -- in many European governments, is in charge of the police force, and has a lot more power than the Secretary of the Interior does in -- in -- comparatively in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2695">So the Minister of the Interior was truly a -- an important position.</sentence><sentence id="2696">But once Hitler became the fuehrer, when he was -- you know, Hitler held three jobs.</sentence><sentence id="2697">He was the fuehrer, that's the leader of the Nazi party, that was really the title fuehrer, and the one that he preferred, which incidentally Streicher gave him.</sentence><sentence id="2698">When they first met, in a <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, and Streicher, who was the leader of an anti- Semitic faction in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, heard about this labor party group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, which was headed by Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="2699">And he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to hear this man Hitler, about whom he had heard, speak.</sentence><sentence id="2700">And he describes in his testimony, he thought he actually saw a halo around his head, he thought this is the Messiah, this is the man who is going to ser -- s-save <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, whereupon he went to Hitler, and said, "You are my fuehrer.</sentence><sentence id="2701">I will follow you, and everything I have is yours."</sentence><sentence id="2702">In his famous words.</sentence><sentence id="2703">And Streicher was one of the few members of the inner party who could dootz Hitler, address him in the familiar German du.</sentence><sentence id="2704">Streicher was one of the few who cou -- even Goering didn't have that power, but Streicher could -- could do that.</sentence><sentence id="2705">And Hitler liked that fuehrer business, and it was Streicher, at their first meeting, who suggested it to him.</sentence><sentence id="2706">And it was the union of those two parties from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> that made the -- the dare -- day ap</sentence><sentence id="2708">9 -- the deutsche arbeit party of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> a national deutsche arbeit party, because the two communities merged, thanks to Streicher, which was why Streicher was particularly dear to Hitler, and considered him very close, and vice versa.</sentence><sentence id="2709">Well, Frick was important at -- at the beginning, and he was a -- I think he wanted to be the police, or he was the police commissioner in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> at the time of the putsch.</sentence><sentence id="2710">And he was active in Hitler's political endeavors, and of course became one of the followers.</sentence><sentence id="2711">And then he was elected to the <span class="BUILDING">Reichstag</span> and Hitler became chancellor and named him Minister of the Interior.</sentence><sentence id="2712">But then when Himmler came into the play, and took over the Gestapo and the -- the -- the SS and all -- all the police duties and the security services went to Himmler and Frick really had nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="2713">He -- his position was strictly a -- up until beyond 1935, he -- he was really nobody.</sentence><sentence id="2714">He really did -- didn't have much of a -- a role, and colorless, sort of a -- a gray aura about him.</sentence><sentence id="2715">His whole appearance, gray hair, gray face and gray clothes, he -- he was just -- in a bunch of people, he would never stand out.</sentence><sentence id="2716">Even if there were only two people in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, he wouldn't stand out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2752">A: -- but it was legal.</sentence><sentence id="2753">You see, i-it was -- everything he did was legal.</sentence><sentence id="2754">He -- he was the -- a legal interpretation.</sentence><sentence id="2755">And yes, of course the Jews had to be done away with because that was the law, and the Nuremberg laws, and no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="2756">Now, if you say, did you have anything to do</sentence><sentence id="2758">0 with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> -- which incidentally was not a question we -- I don't remember -- I don't think I ever asked it of anybody, cause I really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="2759">I -- I just -- wasn't in my -- I think with Streicher, it -- it had to come up, as I recall, o-of his -- of his own volition.</sentence><sentence id="2760">Where he would bring it up, but never the details, as far as people being abused or starved.</sentence><sentence id="2761">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, as Streicher explained it to me, is very simple.</sentence><sentence id="2762">Here were these communists, and these communists were causing a lot of problems -- I'm giving Streicher's explanation.</sentence><sentence id="2763">And so when the big election came along, at which time Hitler was to be the plebiscite, when Hitler was to be the supreme being, the fuehrer of the political party and then the chancellor of the German Reich, which ran the government, and then the president of the German Reich, after Hindenburg.</sentence><sentence id="2764">So he was president, chancellor and fuehrer.</sentence><sentence id="2765">Political, organizational and ceremonial.</sentence><sentence id="2766">So he really had three jobs under the title of fuehrer.</sentence><sentence id="2767">Well, when all of this came into being, the communists had to be concentrated out of sight so that they couldn't cause any problems.</sentence><sentence id="2768">They were having demonstrations and disrupting political meetings, and the communists were causing problems.</sentence><sentence id="2769">So they were put into <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> and even some abandoned <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, as a temporary measure to concentrate them out of sight where we could concentrate -- keep our eyes on them.</sentence><sentence id="2770">Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was just convenient to keep them there.</sentence><sentence id="2771">It turned out that many of the communists were Jews, so it was natural for those communists, and those Jews to end up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2772">But you couldn't keep them in these temporary facilities, so he had to build facilities for them.</sentence><sentence id="2773">And this is how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> came into being a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, to bring these people together from the <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> and <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where they were tentatively kept, and put them into one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2774">That of course was the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2775">The ultimate solution, of course was, as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> grew bigger and more and more people ended up in them, and the problem of feeding them, and they could no</sentence><sentence id="2777">1 longer buy their way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by surrendering their property to the German regime, they had to come up with a final solution, the final solution was extermination.</sentence><sentence id="2778">And that, of course is when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the others came in -- into being.</sentence><sentence id="2779">And that was the whole pattern.</sentence><sentence id="2780">Now Streicher took responsibility only up to when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were built, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2781">And then points out that he actually at Christmastime, as a Christmas gift, a humane gesture on his part, to prove what a big heart he had, he actually arranged for the release of some of these people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2782">Communists, never Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2783">He never arranged for a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2784">And this -- I'm quoting him now, how proud he was, "Nobody could ever accuse me of letting a Jew out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2785">That had to be put in.</sentence><sentence id="2786">That was part of his -- his make-up.</sentence><sentence id="2787">But he had a Christmas party and he would invite the families of these people that he was releasing from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2788">And they didn't know it, the families didn't know what was going to happen, neither did the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2789">They were suddenly whisked away to some <span class="BUILDING">gym</span>, or some <span class="BUILDING">public building</span>, then the <span class="DLF">doors</span> would be opened, and the families, and the -- the inmates would come together.</sentence><sentence id="2790">And you know, nine out of 10 of those would become members of the Nazi party in appreciation.</sentence><sentence id="2791">And this is why he did it, because he was the goodwill -- a lot of these communists became Nazis after he released them from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2836">Q: That's what he told you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2838">A: That was one of his accomplishments and -- and that was really his motivation, but he never let Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="2839">That was his kins -- his principles.</sentence><sentence id="2840">Well, Fr-Frick, as I said, his role in all of this was that he merely -- his job was to write the laws, interpret the laws as Minister of the Interior, and to follow those laws.</sentence><sentence id="2841">And nothing he did was ever illegal, according to him, he always followed the law.</sentence><sentence id="2842">So he did not -- couldn't understand why he was being put in with all these</sentence><sentence id="2844">2 other people who were -- who -- who went beyond the law, obviously, because that resulted in all the atrocities.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2853">Q: How about Herman Goering?</sentence><sentence id="2854">Let -- let me quote -- quote you from your autobiography, you said he was the easiest Nazi to interrogate.</sentence><sentence id="2855">He was able, shrewd manager, brilliant and brave, tuthless and grasping.</sentence><sentence id="2856">At times almost a pleasure to be with, at other times a pain in the ass.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2861">A: Exactly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2863">Q: But it was always interesting to be with him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2865">A: Yup, well that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2866">Q: How about [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2867">A: -- that -- that is it in -- and I've saved that characterization because it -- it still fits in retrospect, looking back on it.</sentence><sentence id="2868">And first of all, Goering did not fit any of the three categories that I mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="2869">Nor was he accepted in those three categories.</sentence><sentence id="2870">Now, he was president of the <span class="BUILDING">Reichstag</span>, which would put him in with the bureaucracy, wouldn't it?</sentence><sentence id="2871">With the government, the secretaries and the ministers.</sentence><sentence id="2872">Well, they didn't accept him.</sentence><sentence id="2873">They didn't want him.</sentence><sentence id="2874">He was not really one of them.</sentence><sentence id="2875">So he was shut out of that group, von Popham, and -- and Meisner, Selta, those, they wanted nothing to do with him.</sentence><sentence id="2876">First of all, because he was promoted over their heads.</sentence><sentence id="2877">They were the men with experience and everything else, and here he -- overnight, he became the president of the Reichstag, he wasn't really one of them.</sentence><sentence id="2878">Military man, yes, seven star general, Reichsmarshall, the highest military rank ever attained by anybody in history, except Hannibal maybe.</sentence><sentence id="2879">But he wasn't mem -- a member of the German general's staff.</sentence><sentence id="2880">He -- he was never considered the -- the red stripe of the generale's staff.</sentence><sentence id="2881">So they didn't accept him, none of the generals wanted anything to do with him.</sentence><sentence id="2882">I mean, imagine a guy who, you know, who comes from the rank of a -- a lieutenant in the riktorfin squadron suddenly becomes a seven star</sentence><sentence id="2884">3 Reichsmarshall of the Reich.</sentence><sentence id="2885">And so there was jealousy and there was lack of respect and they never took him seriously.</sentence><sentence id="2886">And incompetence.</sentence><sentence id="2887">Goering was not a very competent man in a sense of organization and -- he -- he could talk a big show, but he could never deliver the goods.</sentence><sentence id="2888">He really wasn't a producer.</sentence><sentence id="2889">So he was resented by the military and he wasn't accepted.</sentence><sentence id="2890">And he didn't really fit into the Nazi element because he was above them all.</sentence><sentence id="2891">He was strutting in his uniforms and make -- making himself super rich by his acquisitions of art and [indecipherable] and special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2892">And then of course the -- the four year plan and the Herman Goering werker.</sentence><sentence id="2893">So he's also an industrialist, in addition to being the huntmaster of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in addition to being the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe.</sentence><sentence id="2894">So the other Nazis never considered him part of their group, even though he had participated in the putsch.</sentence><sentence id="2895">So he's pretty much isolated.</sentence><sentence id="2896">He really wasn't accepted.</sentence><sentence id="2897">Plus, the conflict between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doenitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goering</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2898">Hitler in his last will and testament specified that Doenitz, Grand Admiral Doenitz was to be -- to take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> and become the president or whatever, of the Reich, of the fourth Reich.</sentence><sentence id="2899">But as far as Goering was concerned, he was designated to be Hitler's successor, and it was only because Bormann either misinterpreted or withheld Goering's last message to Hitler from the [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, which resulted in Hitler condemning Goering and supposedly sentencing him to death, to be assassinated by the -- by -- executed by the SS.</sentence><sentence id="2900">That really wasn't Hitler's doing, that was Bormann, who intercepted the letters and acted not on Hitler's behalf, but on his own behalf.</sentence><sentence id="2901">So as far as Goering was concerned, he was still the president of the class.</sentence><sentence id="2902">And this group photo I have, who sits in the middle?</sentence><sentence id="2903">The president of the class.</sentence><sentence id="2904">Who is the successor, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doenitz</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2905">He's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back row</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2906">Well, those two fought each other all the time, never face to face, but to us they say, well Goering did this wrong, he did that wrong, and he's a nobody and then of course, Doenitz didn't do this and didn't do that right.</sentence><sentence id="2907">So that contest was going on all the time,</sentence><sentence id="2909">4 competing for each other for the crown under those circumstances, which was amusing.</sentence><sentence id="2910">Now Goering personally then, to be with him was -- was -- the nice part was, when you left Goering, if you got bored with his pomposity and his braggadocio, you could just say, well Herr Goering, I -- [have to leave now, I have another appointment.</sentence><sentence id="2911">And as far as he was concerned, that's okay, I let you go now, I'm giving you permission to leave.</sentence><sentence id="2912">He was always condescending.</sentence><sentence id="2913">He never -- he never acted like he was a prisoner in -- he was always in charge.</sentence><sentence id="2914">When you went to interrogate him, you were visiting him.</sentence><sentence id="2915">It wasn't interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="2916">Or when he came to your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for an interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="2917">Sometimes an interrogation was done out in the gar -- on the <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2918">We'd go for a walk together in the <span class="DLF">hotel gardens</span> and talk.</sentence><sentence id="2919">But it was always, I'm free to talk to you now, you can come and see me.</sentence><sentence id="2920">Or I'll give you an appointment at one o'clock this afternoon for a visit to your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2921">So he dismissed you and welcomed you always as the Reichsmarshall on [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2922">Secondly, you -- you had to take that with a grain of salt and that's part of the game.</sentence><sentence id="2923">Secondly, he had a terrific sense of humor, he really did.</sentence><sentence id="2924">And he enjoyed himself tremendously, h-his own jokes.</sentence><sentence id="2925">He could laugh harder at his own jokes than anybody I knew.</sentence><sentence id="2926">And I think I mentioned in my book that he had a collection of jokes being told about him in the underground, which he collected, he had written up in a little ba -- joke book.</sentence><sentence id="2927">And occasionally, if he was in the mood, he would produce his little book and that reminded him of a story, and he would tell you a joke out of his -- his little book.</sentence><sentence id="2928">Sometimes off-color jokes, but always with himself as the butt of the joke.</sentence><sentence id="2929">If you were caught telling a joke like that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, that was good for six months in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2930">But he collected the joke and -- and save it.</sentence><sentence id="2931">He was able to laugh at himself, which is a strange thing to say about a man who took himself very, very seriously, and who spent every living moment making sure that you knew that he was really the leading Nazi and he was really in charge.</sentence><sentence id="2932">And he did this and did that, and he was one of the few</sentence><sentence id="2934">5 who admitted <span class="BUILDING">building</span> this and <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that, and this was really his responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="2935">He accomplished that; I, Herman Goering.</sentence><sentence id="2936">Yet, he could tell jokes about himself if he was in the mood.</sentence><sentence id="2937">He had to be in the mood; he was a very moody person.</sentence><sentence id="2938">Part of which was due to the fact he's a drug addict.</sentence><sentence id="2939">He took paracodeine tablets -- well, the numbers differ.</sentence><sentence id="2940">Some writers say a hundred tablets a day.</sentence><sentence id="2941">I would say that was a little bit much.</sentence><sentence id="2942">But he -- he chewed them like M&amp;M's.</sentence><sentence id="2943">And he had a pocket full.</sentence><sentence id="2944">He actually arrived with -- with a box.</sentence><sentence id="2945">I think he confiscated all the <span class="BUILDING">paracodeine</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before he was taken prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2946">And these were tablets that he just chewed.</sentence><sentence id="2947">One individual tablet probably very weak, but four or five would have the effect of a <span class="BUILDING">Valium</span>, and he would take a handful and just chew on them, and then maybe a half an hour later, take another handful.</sentence><sentence id="2948">And we guessed that he consumed -- by Dr. Flicker, who was the German doctor, and we had an American doctor as well, estimated that he was taking between 60 and 80 a day of -- of these little paracodeine tablets, about the size of M&amp;Ms.</sentence><sentence id="2949">They broke him of the habit, with his cooperation, by reducing the dosage.</sentence><sentence id="2950">At first he didn't realize they were doing it, and then gradually he participated, and then willingly, and almost proudly, to the extent that he lost weight, he lost 80 pounds while in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and actually began to feel pretty good.</sentence><sentence id="2951">As he would say, <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> life was good for my health, and -- because he lost weight and said that physically he felt better after six months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mondorf</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> than he had ever in his adult life, ever since the time of the putsch when he became morphine addicted, so -- but all the time that he was in the Reich, he was, of course, was a morphine addict, and went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> from time to time to be dried out and to take the cure.</sentence><sentence id="2952">And this paracodeine was a way of -- of setting that.</sentence><sentence id="2953">And when they broke him of the habit, he really -- by the time the trials began, he was in pretty good shape, compared to the flab that he was when he first was taken prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2954">Now, other times, if he was in a bad mood, we just stayed away from him because he wouldn't cooperate, he</sentence><sentence id="2956">6 wouldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="2957">He would just say, "I don't feel like talk -- talking today, and -- I'm not interested, I don't want to talk to you today."</sentence><sentence id="2958">And that was it, nothing you could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="2959">He was afraid of thunder and lightning.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Adele.</sentence><sentence id="3790">But this Guyon Vitchell was -- she was a professional spy.</sentence><sentence id="3791">And she apparently had some relationship, whether a love -- whether it was a love relationship, but she knew one of the generals that we had in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> da -- now we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- this is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> now, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, we didn't have any women in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span>, one side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> where all the Nazis were kept was reserved for women.</sentence><sentence id="3792">And Himmler's -- Himmler's secretary, and Ribbentrop's secretary were among the prisoners, mostly</sentence><sentence id="3794">03 as witnesses, not because they were charged with any crimes, or intended to be.</sentence><sentence id="3795">And this Vitchell apparently, I don't know why she was taken prisoner, cause there were a lot of spies, and -- and some of them we even knew about.</sentence><sentence id="3796">But this one, I think because she had the connection with this general -- and we thought that was the -- the spy on the higher rank, because the relationship -- and they were exchanging notes with each other.</sentence><sentence id="3797">And we -- our curiosity was aroused by how -- how she could write a note and end up -- ends up in his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3798">So obviously one of our guards was delivering messages from one prisoner to another.</sentence><sentence id="3799">And that was strictly verboten, that wa -- that was not allowed at all.</sentence><sentence id="3800">So this was one of my functions, that -- that Colonel Andrews delegated to me when I became his special assistant.</sentence><sentence id="3801">So I was to find out how this note business was going about.</sentence><sentence id="3802">And wi -- the -- the whole incident was that I -- I went -- went to her <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, naturally.</sentence><sentence id="3803">And the guards were not allowed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="3804">They were -- they had to stand <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3805">And up at that section I think was one guard for the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span>, we only had five or six women prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="3806">But I noticed that Vitchell, who was a rather striking looking woman, and when -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe that came all the way to her feet.</sentence><sentence id="3807">And -- which I thought was unusual prison garb, but they weren't really being held as -- as criminals, so I didn't pay too much attention to it.</sentence><sentence id="3808">But I was asking her questions, and I forget how the sequel went, because I didn't attach that much importance to it, but I did notice that she had a good stack of American cigaret -- cigarettes brand -- American brand cigarettes, loosely, not in a pack, but i-in a tray on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3809">And in the course of questioning, she -- I asked her where she got those cigarettes and she had no hesitancy at all in answering by just opening her robe.</sentence><sentence id="3810">And I found out she was abs -- absolutely stark naked underneath the robe.</sentence><sentence id="3811">Which was unusual prison garb also.</sentence><sentence id="3812">And then I put two and two together and I said, "Let me see if I have this figured right.</sentence><sentence id="3813">You get those cigarettes," because they were not prison issue, "you get those</sentence><sentence id="3815">04 cigarettes from the guard.</sentence><sentence id="3816">And you give him peep show and he tosses in a cigarette," through the <span class="DLF">opening</span> where we pass their food.</sentence><sentence id="3817">And she said I had that absolutely right.</sentence><sentence id="3818">Well, I don't know whether the guard was listening on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, which I think he was, and there really wasn't anything I could do about it, and it really wasn't that much of an issue.</sentence><sentence id="3819">But obviously one of the guards who was willing to carry the messages was giving extra cigarettes and doing her that favor, which -- it struck my sense of humor.</sentence><sentence id="3820">I don't think it was a criminal offense, I didn't want to -- but I knew if I reported this to Colonel Andrews, somebody would end up in the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brig</span>, and somebody would be severely punished.</sentence><sentence id="3821">So I -- [had a little fun, I came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, and the guard was standing in there, and just by looking at him, I could tell that he -- he knew what I -- what the conversation was, cause he's all red in the face, and -- and being extra polite and standing at rigid attention, almost like a statue.</sentence><sentence id="3822">So I just went up to him right face to face and looked at him and said, if you won't tell, I won't tell, or something to that effect, and walked away.</sentence><sentence id="3823">And he said, "Thank you, sir."</sentence><sentence id="3824">And he clicked his heels.</sentence><sentence id="3825">And I became very popular with the guards cause the word got around very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="3826">But I reported this to Colonel Andrews, who had no sense of humor at all.</sentence><sentence id="3827">And Colonel Andrews would occasionally repeat the same story, but he had it all mixed up.</sentence><sentence id="3828">And he was giving a -- I think it was Ribbentrop's secretary or one of -- one of those people's secretaries" credit for being the -- the person that exposed herself.</sentence><sentence id="3829">And that particular person was extremely ugly, and -- and nobody would give up a cigarette to look at her in the nude or even dressed.</sentence><sentence id="3830">So that made it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3932">Q: No, no, go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3934">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="3935">Well, the -- the whole purpose of that visit -- and that was fully understood -- in fact, I had orders.</sentence><sentence id="3936">Remember, there was a non-fraternization law, and American personnel were not permitted to fraternize with Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3937">You could get in real trouble just by seeing -- seeing -- by being seen talking to a German.</sentence><sentence id="3938">So I had a special set of orders, as to -- that I was a member of military intelligence, and was authorized to enter <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span>, and also authorized to interrogate, investigate whatever mission Id -- I decided on.</sentence><sentence id="3939">But I had official authorization.</sentence><sentence id="3940">And this was on my -- on my orders, which I always carried with me, because like an instance, like if anybody, military police had seen me going into a <span class="BUILDING">German home</span>, I could have gotten in real trouble if I wasn't authorized.</sentence><sentence id="3941">Course, there was a lot of fraternization going on throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but it was one of those rules that was a little bit ridiculous because in my [indecipherable] here was our opportunity with an army of occupation to really do some brainwashing of the Germans, and convince them that our system is far superior to the Nazi system.</sentence><sentence id="3942">And we could have organized the German youth into basketball teams and soccer teams and football teams and tell them about American sportsmanship.</sentence><sentence id="3943">Instead, we weren't allowed to talk to them, which to me seemed a little silly.</sentence><sentence id="3944">We -- we missed a wonderful opportunity, which</sentence><sentence id="3946">08 was reversed when the Marshall plan went into effect and we then did what we should have done immediately after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3947">But this fraternization policy was ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="3948">One more secret to the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warlimont</span> is that on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- and I did get the documents.</sentence><sentence id="3949">And I don't know what happened to all of the documents, but I do know that years later I purchased a book from my <span class="BUILDING">library</span> written by John Wheeler Bennett, which was the -- the mc -- "Nemesis of Power; A History of the German General's Staff."</sentence><sentence id="3950">And I know that a lot of the research and documentation that appeared in John Wheeler Bennett's book had to come from the documents that we recovered through General Warlimont on this visit -- il-illegal visit to his family.</sentence><sentence id="3951">On the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I didn't travel the <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span>, I took the side <span class="DLF">roads</span>, because just in case of an accident or something, I still would have trouble explaining what I was doing traveling with a three star German general who was really a prisoner of war.</sentence><sentence id="3952">So I took the side <span class="DLF">roads</span> pretty much.</sentence><sentence id="3953">And we were right near the <span class="BUILDING">Bavarian headquarters</span> of General Patton, who had been appointed the military governor of <span class="REGION">Bavaria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3954">And we were traveling along this somewhat isolated <span class="DLF">country road</span>, heading back toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberoszul</span> when there was a commotion ahead of us, and obviously some kind of a traffic disturbance.</sentence><sentence id="3955">And I pulled my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> over to side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and got out and stood by the <span class="DLF">road</span> to see what was coming my way, and when they reached me with the sirens going, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> with a flasher and siren, full blast, and then a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">staff car</span> with license plate and four stars.</sentence><sentence id="3956">And in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> was no less a person than General Patton and his dog.</sentence><sentence id="3957">And of course I threw a fancy salute and General Patton acknowledged it by raising his riding crop, which he had in his hand, and passed on.</sentence><sentence id="3958">And a fantastic thought that occurred to me was that if I had only had enough nerve to stop the -- that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>, and introduced General Patton to the German general, who had arranged all of the offensive and defensive maneuvers, including the invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, and say, "This is the guy who tried to stop you, general.</sentence><sentence id="3959">And this general is the</sentence><sentence id="3961">09 man who -- whom you couldn't stop."</sentence><sentence id="3962">It would have been quite a meeting, but I would have had an awful time explaining what I was doing illegally with -- traveling with this important PW.</sentence><sentence id="3963">So that was the whole story of that.</sentence><sentence id="3964">Visiting Mrs. Goering was part of the same scheme, th-the agreement was -- and our military intelligence was that any way we could gather information be useful, and visiting their families was not only a gesture that opened up and loosened tongues, but it also gave us a chance to get another viewpoint as I -- I mentioned earlier.</sentence><sentence id="3965">So I went to -- went to visit Mrs. Goering.</sentence><sentence id="3966">The housekeeper answered the <span class="DLF">door</span> and saw my American uniform and all but slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in my face, she would have nothing to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="3967">So I went back and I told Goering that I tried to see his wife.</sentence><sentence id="3968">He knew that -- where I was going, I said I'm -- I was going on a trip and I was coming near where his wife was.</sentence><sentence id="3969">I think was one of the -- one of the <span class="BUILDING">chateaus</span> that had once belonged to him, she was living in part of it.</sentence><sentence id="3970">He then gave me a -- a picture of himself and Emmy and their little daughter Edda, and wrote on the back of it that Oberloitman Gillen has my confidence and -- and trust, and signed Hermann Goering, and the date, August eighth, I remember, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="3971">It was August -- yeah, I think it's August eighth.</sentence><sentence id="3972">Anyhow, I went back there several weeks later on another business trip and stopped there, and this time I showed the housekeeper the photo and she took it into Mrs. [indecipherable] Miss [indecipherable] -- Mrs. Goering, and she herself came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and invited me in.</sentence><sentence id="3973">I only stayed a few minutes, just small talk and -- and talking to her a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="3974">I promised that I would come back, because I had someone else in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with me as I recall, and I didn't want to make too much of a -- a visit out of it, other than my just delivering a letter, and so I promised to come back.</sentence><sentence id="3975">And I went back again a couple of weeks later with a letter to the little girl from her father.</sentence><sentence id="3976">And Mrs. Goering was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, she'd been arrested by military government -- government for the art treasures, and she certainly was involved in s-some of that art confiscation.</sentence><sentence id="3977">And the little</sentence><sentence id="3979">10 girl was in a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3980">So I went to visit her and actually held her on my lap and read her father's letter to her, which was a kind of an emotional experience that I wasn't soliciting.</sentence><sentence id="3981">But that was the occasion of -- of that partis -- personal visit.</sentence><sentence id="3982">Others were -- wives visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> during the time that I was working for Colonel Andrews directly, as sort of an assistant prison public relations officer.</sentence><sentence id="3983">And when they had visitors like that, I know Mrs. Jodl came, and Streicher's wife, and oh, two or three others that -- oh, von Ribbentrop's wife, who incidentally is a very ugly woman, personally di -- but she was a -- an heir to the Henkle champagne people.</sentence><sentence id="3984">In this case -- and he was a salesman for the <span class="DLF">champagne line</span>, I think it was Henkle [indecipherable] Henkle or one of the others.</sentence><sentence id="3985">Anyhow, he married the boss's daughter and this is how he -- how he got ahead.</sentence><sentence id="3986">Von Ribbentrop, incidentally, I don't know if you knew that he was not really a von.</sentence><sentence id="3987">No, he -- h-he was born Ribbentrop, but there was an aunt who was married -- his mother's sister who was married to von Ribbentrop -- the other way around, brother, who was knighted, and he had the right to the title von Ribbentrop.</sentence><sentence id="3988">And at age 32, von Ribbentrop himself, the foreign minister, Joachim, arranged for his aunt, Mrs. von Ribbentrop to adopt him at age 32, so that he would become Joachim von Ribbentrop.</sentence><sentence id="3989">Which helped him tremendously because it helped sell him to Hitler, who was impressed by the von idea, plus the fact that von Ribbentrop could speak English and -- and other things.</sentence><sentence id="3990">But she was another one who came to visit in a relationship with families.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4739">Q: My last question has to do with this incident that happened in 1986.</sentence><sentence id="4740">This was after you had completed your assignment as ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and President Reagan was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span>, which caused a huge flurry, and he didn't change his plans.</sentence><sentence id="4741">And you did something other, didn't you?</sentence><sentence id="4742">So could you explain what you thought --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4743">A: It was still during my <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> years --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4744">Q: Oh, it was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4745">A: -- Iwas still ambassador, this 1980 -- this 1985 or "80 -- well it was the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4746">Q: I thought it was "86.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4748">A: No, no, it's 1985, was the 40" anniversary of the end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4750">Q: Oh no, you're right, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4752">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4753">And President Reagan was coming to Europe to commemorate the 40" anniversary and also to attend the summit meeting -- I forget in which one of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4754">And <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- I -- Helmut Kohl in -- invited him to make an official state visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> while he was in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="4755">And Reagan accepted, and was going to Europe -- was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> while he was in Europe for the summit conference, and it would be a state visit.</sentence><sentence id="4756">Now, in a state visit, the -- the way it usually works is the ambassador of the host country and his counterpart in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> would get together and plan an agenda.</sentence><sentence id="4757">And Helmut Kohl had requested of the German</sentence><sentence id="4759">29 ambassador to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that the president should accept an invitation for a state visit, and while there he ought to visit an American -- a -- a <span class="DLF">German military cemetery</span> and lay a wreath to commemorate -- to -- to memorialize the -- the 40" anniversary and to commemorate the end of friction between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, a -- a gesture, a recognition of the bravery of those who fought, so forth, so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4760">And Reagan, who was pretty easily ac -- accepting recommendation, accepted that he would -- he would do this.</sentence><sentence id="4761">I was attending a birthday party for Arthur Burns, who was our ambassador to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and Arthur Burns told me that Reagan was coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for an official visit.</sentence><sentence id="4762">And he thought that he shouldn't visit the <span class="DLF">German military cemetery</span>, that would cause a lot of friction.</sentence><sentence id="4763">Arthur Burns knew what the score was.</sentence><sentence id="4764">And I agreed with him.</sentence><sentence id="4765">And then Arthur Burns said, "Why don't you make a counter-suggestion and have him come to the <span class="DLF">American cemetery</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> instead?"</sentence><sentence id="4766">And I said, "Why don't you, Arthur?"</sentence><sentence id="4767">And he said, "We're both passing the buck."</sentence><sentence id="4768">And he said, "I'm the host ambassador and if I get involved it's really a violation of protocol.</sentence><sentence id="4769">I -- I shouldn't do this, because I'm -- I'm supposed to go along with what the host government wants," and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4770">So I stuck my neck out and I sent a cable, and that was a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="4771">There is such a thing as a <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> signal, and that is a direct <span class="DLF">telephone line</span> from an ambassador to a <span class="BUILDING">White House office</span>, the president, vice president, and also the secure -- national security advisor.</sentence><sentence id="4772">And you use that for really important messages.</sentence><sentence id="4773">And I should have been brave enough to use the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> signal, be the only time I would have -- have used it.</sentence><sentence id="4774">You'd use it if <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> is planning to declare war on the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="4775">But I should have used it to call the president and tell him -- to invite him to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, my proposal being that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span>, which is at his disposal would come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span> where he was making an official visit to the military -- that was our biggest military base, and our most important -- 15 -- 15 minutes less than, he could be in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4778">30 He could land in a <span class="DLF">parking lot</span>, I had it all described, and lay a wreath at General Patton's <span class="DLF">tomb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4779">Then go down 500 yards from the <span class="DLF">American cemetery</span>, there's a <span class="DLF">German military cemetery</span> where 11,000 Germans are buried.</sentence><sentence id="4780">And he could lay a wreath there at the <span class="DLF">tomb</span> of the unknown soldier.</sentence><sentence id="4781">And they could play [indecipherable] and guaranteed no SS, Waffen SS is buried in that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, the Luxembourgers would never stand for it.</sentence><sentence id="4782">The whole thing would take 45 minutes, he could be back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span>, no harm done, everybody would be happy, nobody would criticize.</sentence><sentence id="4783">But I made the mistake of s -- using a regular cablegram, which goes to the state department.</sentence><sentence id="4784">And the state department routinely routes this to the European director, who routes it to the <span class="BUILDING">president's office</span> as a recommendation from an ambassador.</sentence><sentence id="4785">And I think Michael Dever got it and f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was in so many words, mind your own business.</sentence><sentence id="4786">This is all settled.</sentence><sentence id="4787">And that was the e-end of it.</sentence><sentence id="4788">I should have had the courage to -- cause I'd corresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I became ambassador of course, but he knew who I was, and it was on Dear John basis.</sentence><sentence id="4789">And I think I could have gotten through to him, and I've kicked myself ever since.</sentence><sentence id="4790">But anyhow, Reagan came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span> and he went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where some Waffen SS were buried, I forget, 49 or some -- what the number was.</sentence><sentence id="4791">Michael Dever had been there to inspect the site, but the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was covered with snow, so he couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="4792">Well, he could have gone to the <span class="BUILDING">registration office</span>, any <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kid could have told him that there were SS men buried in the American military ceme -- Waffen SS.</sentence><sentence id="4793">But he didn't [indecipherable] but that -- that was his problem, among others.</sentence><sentence id="4794">Well, then I received an invitation from the Jewish community congregation in <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, that there was going to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same time that Reagan was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span> at the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, at the <span class="DLF">American cemetery</span> in [indecipherable].Would I accept to come?</sentence><sentence id="4795">And my good friend, Mr. Ocks, who was the president of the</sentence><sentence id="4797">31 congregation was very surprised when I personally called him and said, "Of course, I'Il come, I'll be very happy to be there."</sentence><sentence id="4798">He couldn't believe it, he said, "Oh," he said, "we're putting you on the spot."</sentence><sentence id="4799">Beca -- I had a very good relationship with him, I used to give talks to a roomful of survivors from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> and -- and Rabbi Boltz is a -- a good personal friend, and used to invite him to our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, along with the Catholic Archbishop of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4800">Was always a very in -- but they real good buddies, they were real good friends, h-had a very nice relationship.</sentence><sentence id="4801">Talk about freedom of religion, they really have it over there.</sentence><sentence id="4802">The respect.</sentence><sentence id="4803">Grand Duke and Grand Duchess would come to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on many occasions, and it was just a wonderful relationship.</sentence><sentence id="4804">Anyhow, when I accepted they were very much surprised, and I went.</sentence><sentence id="4805">And that's where I met Rabbi Here, and also some other members of the <span class="BUILDING">Wiesenthal Center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4806">And the second surprise was that I was willing to make a talk -- give a talk, and so I did.</sentence><sentence id="4807">And I brought greetings from the president.</sentence><sentence id="4808">And I was wise enough to at least notify the president that I was going to be there.</sentence><sentence id="4809">Well, the media was there in force, and they really expected me to take off and either blast the president or make some comment.</sentence><sentence id="4810">And -- and I didn't, all -- the only thing I said was I think President Reagan should be here instead of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span>, because this where he could have devil -- deliver a really significant message.</sentence><sentence id="4811">But he's not, and I'm here to represent him, and I bring you greetings and then I'm -- went into my spiel about how grateful we are those who sacrificed and we'll never forget them -- made the regular speech for the occasion, and everybody was happy, except the media, cause I really let them down, I didn't -- I didn't stick my neck out and jeopardize my job.</sentence><sentence id="4812">But I was jeopardizing it because if Reagan had taken offense, or somebody else had wanted to take issue -- but Schulz was very understanding, and he complimented me.</sentence><sentence id="4813">And Weinberger complimented me and they all said fine, everything is great.</sentence><sentence id="4814">And then Reagan's own speech -- that afternoon, we went -- Winnie and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittburg</span> and -- and heard his</sentence><sentence id="4816">32 speech and -- and I've quoted his speech many times, and -- we can't undo what's been done, we can't bring back to life those who have died, but the one lessons we've been taught by World War II is that good much triumph over evil -- I'm quoting roughly, good must triumph over evil and freedom must triumph over totalitarianism.</sentence><sentence id="4817">And a -- we should never forget the lessons learned because that"!</sentence><sentence id="4818">help us make a better future than -- the gist of his [indecipherable] which he would build his speech.</sentence><sentence id="4819">So everybody was okay, except the media, and the thi -- and people who got the idea from some media presentations, with which I disagree, that he was perfectly willing to go to that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4820">Actually, at that point -- President Reagan was the kind of president who relied pretty much on his lieutenants.</sentence><sentence id="4821">He -- he delegated, and he was a eight to five man, and some of that is good and some of it is bad.</sentence><sentence id="4822">But he didn't get involved in details, he never did.</sentence><sentence id="4823">Some presidents get too involved in details and that's wrong, too.</sentence><sentence id="4824">And you do have a staff, you do have people around you and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span>, so take what you will of that.</sentence><sentence id="4825">But -- but Reagan really didn't know -- I don't think ever -- anybody ever told him that there were Waffen SS buried there.</sentence><sentence id="4826">And if they had, I don't think he'd have known the difference, unless somebody told him.</sentence><sentence id="4827">I mean, how many people know the difference between the SS of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> type and the Waffen SS?</sentence><sentence id="4828">There is a difference.</sentence><sentence id="4829">And the Waffen SS, unfortunately, was sort of an elite military unit, and sort of like our Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Waffen SS ended up with a lot of regular SS men in it, and they began to do a lot of the things that the -- the occupying forces, the atrocities against the civilian population, and of course the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, the thing [indecipherable] so there was a -- a definite mix, but the president wouldn't have known that.</sentence><sentence id="4830">In fact, I don't think anybody in his staff would have particularly known this, unless somebody told
