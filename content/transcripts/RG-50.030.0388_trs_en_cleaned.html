<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Of course, part of the reason I ask this is that you later on, and -- were very active with the partisans, and I just wondered if -- if any of this came from kind of your life, or your ideology before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: And you probably didn't think that that would affect you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: No, till -- till the -- when the war started, yes, we wonder -- this is why when -- I try to go toward -- toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> when the war started, because I thought I -- maybe there will be a fight, and I'1l not be on the side with the Germans, but I'll be in the -- where the pol - - Polish are, and -- but unfortunately on their way, the Germans went faster toward -- came faster toward -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, to -- practically to -- see, they didn't take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, but close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, so that I was under the Germans, and -- and decided to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">When I came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, was about a few days, the commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, a ger -- the German, told all Jews to come out one day.</sentence><sentence id="111">It was about the 15" abou -- of -- of -- of September, and put all the Jews in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took them out towards the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">Left us in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Polish army used to exercise.</sentence><sentence id="113">The next morning they came again, and told us to walk toward the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="114">And we walked over there, and they took away everything what we ha -- what we still had, if they saw anything valuable.</sentence><sentence id="115">Like, my father forgot to hide his golden watch what he had from his father, they took it away.</sentence><sentence id="116">And I still remember to -- today the first Russian soldier we saw.</sentence><sentence id="117">And while the German were talking to us in such a derogative way, he was so nice, and said something, and I didn't understand a word what he said.</sentence><sentence id="118">My father understood Russian because as a child, Shasnich was under the Russian, and he learned Russian.</sentence><sentence id="119">So he said, "Oh, he told us to go over there, where there is soup for us."</sentence><sentence id="120">Alright, we went there -- the Jewish population of this small <span class="NPIP">place</span> me -- pr-prepare soup -- soup for us.</sentence><sentence id="121">For we a-ate something warm, and after that they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Couple questions.</sentence><sentence id="136">First, I'm sort of curious why the Germans pushed you toward <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> rather than just taking care of you themselves, and the other thing I want you talk a little bit about is kind of the general kind of mood, what it -- what this all felt like.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="139">A As a whole, we were scared all the time, because we did not -- we knew that they hate Jews, as a fer -- a matter of fact, they -- this is why they took all the Jews and send them out, because they said that our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> will be incorporated in the -- in the Reich, and they did not want to have Jews, the addition of Jews in the -- in the Reich, so they sa -- told us to go.</sentence><sentence id="140">And from the <span class="COUNTRY">Russian</span> point of view it was very nice [indecipherable] let us come in, as a matter of fact, for approximately two months, it -- <span class="DLF">borders</span> were opening, everybody who came, who could -- who took advantage, and cou -- and came, survived.</sentence><sentence id="141">More Polish Jews survived after that in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> than in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">The mood was of unknown.</sentence><sentence id="143">We don't know what expects us.</sentence><sentence id="144">We know that after that -- after [indecipherable] already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> that we are free to do various things, that nobody persecute us as Jew.</sentence><sentence id="145">If there is something, a lack of certain things, because we saw how eagerly the j -- Russian soldiers is buying various things on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="146">indecipherable] So it is because everybody -- or nobody has enough, but not because we were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="147">So from this point of view I felt a -- it was good and we thanked th-the -- th-the German officer did not like to have Jews in hi -- in [indecipherable] in the -- in th-the matter of fact, in comparison is all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span>, more Jews survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shasnich</span> than all the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around it, because they were completely destroyed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

other -- other food for the -- for the vodka.</sentence><sentence id="446">We were a steady supplier, and we were giving them, and a little bit leaving over for us.</sentence><sentence id="447">And once I remember I went over and a policeman caught me, with a ra -- another guy and I -- and I was thinking a -- I was looking for a stone to hit him, because I -- you know, I will not go into the -- into the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, because if somebody was taken to the police, he never came back.</sentence><sentence id="448">But he went with me, he saw where I came from, and

saw you, walking with a bottle of vodka.</sentence><sentence id="454">So we went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I paid for the vodka so that he can take the vodka, and he let me go.</sentence><sentence id="455">And he let you go, too."</sentence><sentence id="456">So this was anything, this is how we were trying to get out.</sentence><sentence id="457">It was no problem to go out, because we always -- we're -- we're walking around with something to cut the wires, in order to be able to pass.</sentence><sentence id="458">But the question, well what you do after that?Everybody was -- most of the people were scared.</sentence><sentence id="459">There was one family to -- I used to go there to ask them for a piece of bread to bring to my sister, or -- and after that he begged me not to come, because he didn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span>, because he said the neighbors know, they noticed it.</sentence><sentence id="460">Because they were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="461">They did not want to be killed just because I came there.</sentence><sentence id="462">So we were going -- we were taken to work.</sentence><sentence id="463">At <span class="BUILDING">work</span> we were getting -- men were ge -- getting some food at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">And there I was always either begging, if it

piece of bread, or something else to eat, and if he was bad, he gave me a kick.</sentence><sentence id="466">So if it was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, I was -- there were always something growing, so we're stealing a few -- a few carrots, or a few potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="467">And if the -- in the worse case, when they didn -- when I didn't have what to take, so I was taking even the clippings from potatoes from the -- from where we worked, for it was -- my sister used to wash the clipping, and make -- make from this potato latkes.</sentence><sentence id="468">And this is on what they lived.</sentence><sentence id="469">Since the war -- the war -- the wa -- there was one guy who we always were ascared of, and his name was Gorajetski.</sentence><sentence id="470">He was a -- he had written on the -- belina politsi was written.</sentence><sentence id="471">He spoke Russian and German, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="472">And he could not eat breakfast without killing a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="473">And once we -- he got us, and we worked for him, my brother-in-law and myself, and we said never again.</sentence><sentence id="474">And this was not work, it was just making fun of us.</sentence><sentence id="475">Trying to catch -- to carry -- and running and beating us while we were carrying it from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and then another group was taking it further, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="476">This was fun for him.</sentence><sentence id="477">So -- and after that, he organized like a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> separate.</sentence><sentence id="478">The people could not come from [indecipherable] outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="479">They were there with a group of Ukrainians were guarding it, and these people could not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they were sleeping over there.</sentence><sentence id="480">So whenever we saw him we did not go to work, because normally people -- other workers were coming, looking for people to work, taking to work, doing either construction work, or cleaning, or whatever, and in the evening coming back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="481">This we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="482">In order to avoid, since they were looking for work -- were looking for workers each time, and looking for people to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- it was on <span class="DLF">Schirrocca Street</span>, I remember, we -- in order to be able to hide, we built a <span class="DLF">double wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="483">A very -- we moved the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, made it a little narrower.</sentence><sentence id="484">Since we worked in <span class="BUILDING">construction</span>, I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">neighbors room</span> and covered it, a -- because otherwise we could -- you could see through.</sentence><sentence id="485">And in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> was just <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">So we could open, go in, hide, and -- and talk to neighbors, they realized, hey, whenever they're looking for -- for men, you are running <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="487">Where do you hide in the -- in there?</sentence><sentence id="488">And then they saw the -- the Ukrainians are going in and coming out empty, no wa -- nobody -- they don't catch you.</sentence><sentence id="489">They looked -- they told us, they look for where we're hiding, and they didn't no -- they didn't no -- notice that we had build this -- this <span class="DLF">double wall</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="490">Other people were hiding behind -- under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> -- the fir -- floor, there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to crawl in, and they were hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="491">So this was as long as they were looking just for men, and once we saw e -- they were taking whole families.</sentence><sentence id="492">Since we lived all in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a free, for Aryan, not for Jews, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, on this side was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">And so we saw they were -- they take -- they took whole families, a few thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="494">And taking them out and then they never came back.</sentence><sentence id="495">And they shortened the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller.</sentence><sentence id="496">So we start to think, what do we do for -- if -- if they come here?</sentence><sentence id="497">In addition to wait, we started to hear that they have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> where they put in people, and put the gas in -- in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span>, and they gas the people in there.</sentence><sentence id="498">So whenever we heard -- heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> coming, we started to hide.</sentence><sentence id="499">What to do with the -- your little girl, the little girl that we too -- took her in between the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, was crying there.</sentence><sentence id="500">So we cided -- decided to build something on the first of this -- we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">On the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, there was one <span class="NPIP">part</span> which was not finished.</sentence><sentence id="502">In one of the not finished <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, they build a deep, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, we put wa -- tube, so to -- so they'll get air, and there we saw, when the little girl was crying, outside you didn't hear.</sentence><sentence id="503">So the next time there was a thing where we had to hide, I was taking my brother-in-law, sister, and the child to this, lay down, and I was covering it with sand.</sentence><sentence id="504">Sand made it even so that you don't see that anything is there.</sentence><sentence id="505">Then I was going up and hiding in the -- between the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">And this way how we were all kind of -- we call it pogroms, we survived the pogroms in this way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
