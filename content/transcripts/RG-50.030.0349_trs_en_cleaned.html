<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: What's the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: .</sentence><sentence id="321">And in the distance we could see -- on the <span class="DLF">road</span> in the distance -- moving side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">We could see that in the distance.</sentence><sentence id="323">And we had seen very few French soldiers in the preceding days.</sentence><sentence id="324">There were very few French soldiers in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, practically none.</sentence><sentence id="325">Were just a few stragglers who were trying to go wherever they could.</sentence><sentence id="326">And so we saw -- late at night -- it was almost dusk -- and the color of their uniform was strange.</sentence><sentence id="327">It was very strange.</sentence><sentence id="328">So at first we thought they were British soldiers who were trying to -- to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> to -- we were told that the British were re-embarking that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">No, they were Germans, and it was absolutely frightening, because they were -- I'm sure they were exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="330">And they were two to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">One was driving and the other one was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sidecar</span> with a machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="332">And their face was -- they were blonde and -- they were -- they had the typical Germans.</sentence><sentence id="333">And their face covered with the dust of the</sentence><sentence id="335"><span class="DLF">road</span> -- they were looking absolutely -- they were awful.</sentence><sentence id="336">They were raw, military power.</sentence><sentence id="337">And of course, I understood that years later, when I was myself in the Army, the people who are sent like that are the best.</sentence><sentence id="338">They are the people who can analyze a situation and take action and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="339">So they passed by us, and I remember we were walking by the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the French Gendarmes and it was a hot evening and they had like a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there with the sign and the flag.</sentence><sentence id="340">And the wife of one of the Gendarmes there almost collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="341">She had a -- she had a cry.</sentence><sentence id="342">And they removed the French flag immediately.</sentence><sentence id="343">They knew what -- so -- and they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="344">And then the next morning, the other came, and they were the Herman Goerring (ph.)</sentence><sentence id="345">division.</sentence><sentence id="346">And they came with big guns and weapons and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="347">And they stopped to engage in conversation with us.</sentence><sentence id="348">And -- I'm sure they were under orders to be very friendly -- and they were friendly.</sentence><sentence id="349">They were friendly.</sentence><sentence id="350">One of them asked me why I was not in the army.</sentence><sentence id="351">And I told him, "Well, I'm 15."</sentence><sentence id="352">He said, "Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, 15, .</sentence><sentence id="353">And they were very proud to be member of the Herman Goerring division.</sentence><sentence id="354">And they were telling us, Well, a week we'll be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">And after that they left.</sentence><sentence id="356">I don't know where they went.</sentence><sentence id="357">And they were replaced by the regular German Army.</sentence><sentence id="358">That <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">administrative city</span>, so they established a commandanture there.</sentence><sentence id="359">But that was essentially for them -- you know, they -- they ordered a curfew for the population and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="360">But at the same time they were trying to show to the French people that, Well, we are not that bad.</sentence><sentence id="361">And I remember, we stayed there one month before we were able to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">And one of the son of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was a Navy officer who died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.038" long="2.378">Dunkirk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">And his body was recovered and was sent to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be buried in the <span class="BUILDING">family vault</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> came to the funeral in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">And the Germans sent an honor guard there.</sentence><sentence id="366">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="367">And they allowed his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> to be draped in the French flag.</sentence><sentence id="368">So -- and when -- when -- so they had a Mass inside the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and when they came out, you know, people were carrying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> on their shoulders, and the Germans had the salute with their rifles.</sentence><sentence id="369">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: Now, I may have interrupted you earlier.</sentence><sentence id="422">When you were -- when you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to go to <span class="REGION">Brittany</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: -- was that because you all felt it was safer because the Germans had already arrived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: Well, it was -- was -- was also because the battlefront was getting close to us.</sentence><sentence id="434">And the day that we left -- we were living outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and it was like a development, we -- I mean, little <span class="BUILDING">cottages</span>, and a <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">It was our second <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, actually.</sentence><sentence id="436">And we could hear the gun all night long -- guns -- big guns.</sentence><sentence id="437">Big guns, artillery.</sentence><sentence id="438">Which were close to us.</sentence><sentence id="439">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> flying all over and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="440">And then in the morning when we got up, at the end of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> -- of the <span class="DLF">street</span> there, a company, or a platoon of French infantry.</sentence><sentence id="441">And they were colonial troops.</sentence><sentence id="442">They were Senegalese.</sentence><sentence id="443">They were in <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> with -- looked like a battle was going to take place right there.</sentence><sentence id="444">So we fled.</sentence><sentence id="445">We fled.</sentence><sentence id="446">And our neighbor -- next-door neighbor -- was from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and she say, Okay, we'll take -- her son was fighting -- and she's saying, Okay, let's go to my sister's in <span class="REGION">Brittany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">So we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were still working.</sentence><sentence id="449">You know, it's crazy -- stuff is absolutely crazy.</sentence><sentence id="450">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were working, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">We had to change <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> -- we went from to .And there, of course, it was confusion.</sentence><sentence id="452">They didn't know which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would leave at when, but they were trying to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">And finally we got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was going the direction that we wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="454">It took us like -- quite -- almost a day.</sentence><sentence id="455">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was packed but we got there.</sentence><sentence id="456">And when we got out of the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> were there.</sentence><sentence id="457">I -- life was normal there.</sentence><sentence id="458">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span>, people were in the <span class="BUILDING">sidewalk cafe</span> and -- they didn't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

set</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">And so that was in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="605">And then he had restrictions about what he could do, in terms of work.</sentence><sentence id="606">He couldn't do this, he couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="607">But he was still working.</sentence><sentence id="608">He couldn't care less.</sentence><sentence id="609">And I was going to <span
