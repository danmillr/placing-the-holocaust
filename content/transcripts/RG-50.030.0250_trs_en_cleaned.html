<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: I was born...born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called L O D Z, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> [_6d_ in Polish].</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Would you tell me about your family and growing up in_6d_?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Well, uh...basically my life was, as a child, was sheltered and beautiful and I remember only wonderful things about my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="30">I had very caring and wonderful parents.</sentence><sentence id="31">My father...uh...was a very educated man, and uh...he had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of...uh...uniforms...uh...sort of like...sol...for soldiers or like...uh...boy scout uniforms also and like preparatory ..uh...school uniforms...uh...and...uh...we were slightly upper middle class family, basically fairly well-to- do.</sentence><sentence id="32">I had a younger brother and...uh...we had a very good life.</sentence><sentence id="33">We used to go..., my brother went to...uh... <span class="BUILDING">Jewish private school</span> where they learned Hebrew and...uh...so on.</sentence><sentence id="34">We went to a <span class="BUILDING">private kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">I went to...uh...uh...regular ...uh... <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> which was...uh...only Jewish because this is the way the system was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that...uh...the Jews had their own, ...then their own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and the Polish people had their own <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">And the reason for that, evidently, was that the Polish people were not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sundays and we did not go on Saturdays.</sentence><sentence id="37">So it was like, ...uh ...basically...uh...helping us not to be sacrilegious and so on, so it was good and we felt good about it.</sentence><sentence id="38">Of course, as far as antisemitism is concerned in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I as a child could...uh...notice things quite a lot.</sentence><sentence id="39">I occasionally would notice or hear that...uh... someone...uh... Jewish was beaten up or that...uh...you know, something...uh...little <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> which was, you know, a small little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>...uh...that was...uh...vandalized or burned or so.</sentence><sentence id="40">Those were little things and...uh...and my parents tried to ...uh...shelter me from it and for me not to, you know, grow up with a complex of these things but I knew of it.</sentence><sentence id="41">L..uh...when I was growing up,...uh...children, Polish children my age...uh...some let me know and would say something bad, "You Damn Jew" or something like that, to me.</sentence><sentence id="42">But...uh...the majority did not because <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*250 2 maybe children did not to such extent understand antisemitism or practice it as the older did, olders did.</sentence><sentence id="43">So, that was it and...uh...I don't know what else I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="44">Life, in my opinion, was beautiful and...to me.</sentence><sentence id="45">Of course, I know that there were...uh...people of lower financial class that maybe did not have it so good in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but they were also people upgraded...uh...as far as financial situation and so on is concerned and they most probably had even a better life...uh...but... uh...I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="46">I know it existed, but I don't really... have not experienced it.</sentence><sentence id="47">We used to go every summer...we used to have a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">Uh...We used to spend our summers there.</sentence><sentence id="49">And a funny thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="50">I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> two years ago, and I visited all those <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">It was a very emotional journey for me.</sentence><sentence id="52">Of course, I still feel like it isn't enough.</sentence><sentence id="53">I would like to go back and see more of it, because I spent a short time in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="54">So maybe I will do it some day again.</sentence><sentence id="55">And then I...uh...the first year, I started going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which was a private and only for Jewish girls.</sentence><sentence id="56">It was a girls" high school and, like I said, private, but unfortunately it did not last too long because the Germans entered...uh...my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in September 1939.</sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, we still went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a couple of months and...uh...but as...uh... time went on, the Germans started occupying...occupying...uh...pri...buildings that...like <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span>, <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span>, and so on, and they settled themselves in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">They only used the third and...uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>, and we had the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="59">But it became dangerous because we had to use the same <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and on some occasions...uh...we have heard that...uh...some girls were abused by the soldiers so for that reason alone, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="60">It would have most probably lasted for another month or so, but it was too dangerous and it wasn't worth it.</sentence><sentence id="61">And...uh...so I stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: What was life in _6d_ like right after the German occupation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Well, right after... Now first of all I would like to describe the entering of the Germans and slightly prior to it.</sentence><sentence id="102">I have heard that the war started with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and, of course, all the soldiers were going toward the <span class="DLF">German borders</span> to defend <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">But it seemed like...its...they just simply turned back, and they were running.</sentence><sentence id="104">Uh...a day or two prior to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the Germans to _6d_, the Polish Army, without actually having, you know, without fighting, ran back and they were passing through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">And they were passing through our <span class="DLF">street</span> and they were heading somehow toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, running away.</sentence><sentence id="106">I will never forget that day because what...what we did, ..-uh...we were preparing sandwiches and food and we were giving it to the soldiers as they were going toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> [the Polish army was retreating eastward in an attempt to avoid encirclement by the Germans].</sentence><sentence id="107">The population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> remained.</sentence><sentence id="108">There were some that...uh...foresaw what was coming for some reason...uh...that also ran to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">Many of those survived and they escaped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">But for a family with children, it was difficult to run away.</sentence><sentence id="111">So basically who ran away is young women and young men that were unattached and many majority of them survived if they could survive the winters in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and later on.</sentence><sentence id="112">Of course, the Germans practically were near...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> [only briefly in early December 1941] and...uh..of course, the Jews were running away and Jews at that time, somewhat were persecuted by...by the Russians also.</sentence><sentence id="113">So, but it still was evidently much easier to survive than to go on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where a majority of... uh... people perished in gas USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 3 <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="128">The Germans have entered _6d_.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Uh...What happened to you and your family?</sentence><sentence id="134">What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="138">We stayed there until about the end of...the beginning of December, actually.</sentence><sentence id="139">And at that point my father thought that it was too dangerous to stay in _6d_, that there were talks about making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where the poorer people...where the poorer Jewish population lived, and they were going to push everybody in there...uh...and since my Mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span>, and my Mother still had relatives living over there, we...we thought that it would be easier for us to get there and, you know, we were hoping that the Germans would not be able to follow us.</sentence><sentence id="140">I mean it was just a dream that, but it...uh...they followed us, but a lot later and in the meantime, we were still able to exist as normal people without being thrown into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How did you exist?</sentence><sentence id="146">How did you live in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: During that time?</sentence><sentence id="150">Well, we...we did not take much with us.</sentence><sentence id="151">Whatever we could pack on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>!</sentence><sentence id="152">And, of course, the...the journey on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> from...uh..._ 6d_ to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> was very unusual too because we were...we had to hide and we had to...uh...sort of...uh... pretend that we were not Jewish and the way we were doing it is, my father used to live during World War I in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for some reason I don't understand why.</sentence><sentence id="153">He was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but he lived for some time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">He spoke a perfect German.</sentence><sentence id="155">As a matter of fact, a German with a dialect, which is very unusual because if a foreigner speaks...uh...German he will not speak with a dialect, because it is very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="156">So he spoke with a dialect and I learned German in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I also was able to speak with Father some German.</sentence><sentence id="157">So we were able to sort of make believe that we are either of German descent or mixed Germans which they sort of, kind of, you know, were lenient with them.</sentence><sentence id="158">And we arrived to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where a German family .... Well, actually not all, also mixed-Germaan ...Germans hid us for a day or two until we were able to continue by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">And since it was winter time it was a very difficult journey because the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were not cleared of snow, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was slipping and sliding, and the horse were...was...uh... tripping and it was a very bumpy, bumpy and bad trip, very cold and so on.</sentence><sentence id="160">But finally we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, and...uh...after a little while.... We lived for sometimes with relatives,...uh.. but later on, we were able to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for ourself and we lived, so.... We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and my father was a designer.</sentence><sentence id="161">I don't know if I mentioned that to you, but he was designing military clothes for the army before the war.</sentence><sentence id="162">He was also designing sportswear.</sentence><sentence id="163">Also...uh...boy scouts uniform and... and...for preparatory school uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="164">So...uh...since he had the knowledge of...of making patterns and...and able to understand how to do things and so on, and I somehow always liked to sew, so we were doing some sewing.</sentence><sentence id="165">Father used to make the patterns and doing things like that; and I, under USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 4 his instruction, would sew the garments and we were able to make some money to sustain ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="166">Because all we needed at that time was just to buy potatoes and...and bread.</sentence><sentence id="167">That was our daily...uh...food, whatever we could make with it, because meat was very scarce and if there was any meat, the Polish people would get it.</sentence><sentence id="168">Somebody that had influence.</sentence><sentence id="169">In order words, people that grew up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so on, knew the natives, the Polish people, and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they were able to sort of obtain other staples of food...of food and so on.</sentence><sentence id="170">But since we were strangers, things were a little bit more difficult for us.</sentence><sentence id="171">Uh...later on, L..uh... decided that I will open up a little <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, and take care of small children for still working parents because it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we were just restricted as far as the time is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="172">In other words, we were not able to get out of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> before a certain time, which I imagine was 7 o'clock in the morning, and we had to be in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> at 5 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="173">But, of course, people still continued working and so on.</sentence><sentence id="174">There were a lot of tailors, shoemakers and...uh... merchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and whatever else, just like it was before the war.</sentence><sentence id="175">So they continued to serve the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="176">And I...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> that I opened...it was in my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which was consisting of one large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a kitchen.(cough) Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="177">But usually, we would clear the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> back, and then accept the children at 9 o'clock and I would take care of them til 1 o'clock; and that helped the family survive because...uh... the kind of parents of the children would occasionally bring some articles of clothing, or extra food that they were able to get, you know, like meat and things like that, and they were paying me a certain amount of money.</sentence><sentence id="178">And I was doing it with another friend of mine who was the same age.</sentence><sentence id="179">We were about 16 at that time.</sentence><sentence id="180">Unfortunately, this young lady was killed by the Germans later on.</sentence><sentence id="181">So, this is how we tried to sustain ourselves during the time until..-until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed and until they took us into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: How was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> formed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was still...uh...not terrible, by comparison to..to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">In other words, we were still sort of free, but we have to abide by the tules of the Germans and..., but we were moving around freely in the area of our confinement; and we were still together, which was the most important thing, my parents and my brother and I. And we...our lives were still sort of normal because we were able to get together with friends, with relatives, and amazing thing that all through our confinements in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is the fact that... uh...we were..., the Jewish population always had a sense of...of wanting to learn...of wanting...of...you know, wanting to have knowledge, so we did not stop.</sentence><sentence id="221">So, in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were...like for example, I continued...I was teaching young children in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">Someone else, who had a little higher education than I, was teaching me.</sentence><sentence id="223">Of course, we all had to pay.</sentence><sentence id="224">And I remember I...] was taking algebra and continued with my German, although I spoke German well, but I...I needed to improve it, in...in writing and so on.</sentence><sentence id="225">And we were...I even took Latin.</sentence><sentence id="226">I took French, and we were able to...to get together and sing Hebrew songs.</sentence><sentence id="227">So it was important because we were still together.</sentence><sentence id="228">We were not torn apart, and therefore...uh...life seemed to be normal.</sentence><sentence id="229">It was very...uh...very special, too, because we...we valued each other much more than...than... It made us think, altho... although I cannot say that we valued each USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 5 other more.</sentence><sentence id="230">We just understood it better because family ties were very close among Jewish family...families in Europe and...uh...ties with friends and relatives were also extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="231">And that was what was sustaining us and making our life bearable, that we did not have the comfort, we did not have...uh...the opportunities; we did not have a million things that we had before, but it did not seem to matter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="246">Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="250">Uh...I will never forget that morning.</sentence><sentence id="251">Usually they...there were no announcements...announcements from the Germans of their plans.</sentence><sentence id="252">They usually did everything totally unexpected.</sentence><sentence id="253">If anything ever leaked out, it was either a gossip or...or it might have been some truth, or the times did not correspond.</sentence><sentence id="254">So...uh...but we knew of...we heard of other people being...uh...transferred to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>; and there were many people that were transferred from small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they were all...uh...you know, put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">And things were getting tighter and tighter, because we had to share our little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with another family and another family.</sentence><sentence id="256">And we realized that it will not last...last like that forever, that things were getting worse.</sentence><sentence id="257">And, of course, the food situation was getting worse because of the incoming of so many people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">So...uh...we prepared ourselves, like for example, we made knapsacks for...for each one separately, and had them packed with the essential clothes; and my father, whatever little money we had, distributed the money among all four, amongst all four of us.</sentence><sentence id="259">That way that if we were separated that we should have the money to be able to help ourself. (</sentence><sentence id="260">Cough) Excuse me. (</sentence><sentence id="261">Cough) Anyhow, so basically we were prepared.</sentence><sentence id="262">We were not able to take any extras because we knew we couldn't carry it.</sentence><sentence id="263">Uh...so we left our household goods, our silverware, even a photo album which was so...so dear to us we had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="264">But I managed to stash away some pictures in a bag and kept it hidden... uh... and sure enough...uh...what happened is a few days later at 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans at the same time knocked in all the <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">The reason for that is that they did not want us to have the opportunity that one should find out, hear from the other and have a chance maybe to...of escaping.</sentence><sentence id="266">So, at the same time, they had hundreds and hundreds of Germans with dogs knocking on people's <span class="DLF">doors</span> and screaming, "Out!</sentence><sentence id="267">Out!</sentence><sentence id="268">Raus!</sentence><sentence id="269">Raus!"</sentence><sentence id="270">So many people, if they were not prepared as we were at that time, ...uh...ran out with basically nothing.</sentence><sentence id="271">And then they ran us all together and gathered us on a <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">Each small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> that was, you know, usually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe had this point that was called the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">So we were all rounded up there and at some point, they had Germans doing a selection: right, left, right, left.</sentence><sentence id="274">So what was happening (cough), they were selecting younger and stronger people to remain in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they were distributing them to those three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that were located in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">One <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woodwork camp</span> where they were cutting wood;

Uh... When we got there we could see from there...uh...the fires going from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...<span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> which impressed us terribly because since we did not know exactly or maybe I was the only one that didn't know, but this is my impression that still stays with me to this day, that this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> where they were burning people.</sentence><sentence id="733">That was my feeling.</sentence><sentence id="734">I did not share it with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="735">Everybody saw it.</sentence><sentence id="736">Maybe some other people were also thinking the same way, but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="737">Uh... when we got there, there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the people that were already there...uh...from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span>we were the last one to come in--were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> so everything was closed up.</sentence><sentence id="738">Uh...But at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>, there were two very long...uh... <span class="DLF">graves</span> dug and when we got there, it was the same Schrot that was in charge of this transportation from...uh...the "Sagewerker"... or in Polish, it's called "Tartak," T-A-R-T-A- K. That means wood factory.[NB: Actually, the correct translation of both terms is "<span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span>"] Uh...He was the same one, and he was in charge of transporting us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">When he told us to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and he says in German, "Women on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, men on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">Make a <span class="DLF">line</span> in fours."</sentence><sentence id="741">Then and he stood at the end of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and said to us, "You have one minute..."

it.</sentence><sentence id="744">I mean it was... uh...if had to describe my feeling it would have to take hundred pages to really, one-by-one, to describe what I felt.</sentence><sentence id="745">But my utmost feeling and reaction was my concern first of all for my parents, for my brother, for my friends, for everybody there.</sentence><sentence id="746">So what do you do in a case like that?</sentence><sentence id="747">And he also saw that I was there.</sentence><sentence id="748">And I also knew that this was this animal that was capable of doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="749">Uh...I was in the third row and my mother was standing near me and I realize how terribly disturbed my mother was.</sentence><sentence id="750">How her facial expression has changed.</sentence><sentence id="751">How her color has changing.</sentence><sentence id="752">She was looked like a ghost.</sentence><sentence id="753">And all could see is her heart going strong under her thin dress and it was so painful to me that I...I didn't know what, but I knew that I had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="754">So I jumped out and jumped straight...he...he didn't expect it.</sentence><sentence id="755">And I jumped straight to him and I knew that if I approach him from the front I have no chance of doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="756">So I jumped on his back.</sentence><sentence id="757">I..-uh...put my fingers around his throat and I started choking him.</sentence><sentence id="758">I jumped with my legs and I put them around his

nails were even longer than now.</sentence><sentence id="761">Uh...and, of course, since I...my grip was so strong and he couldn't walk because I had my legs around his, we both fell.</sentence><sentence id="762">And I still didn't let go because I knew if I let go it was going to be the end of me and especially the end of everybody else there.</sentence><sentence id="763">So I did not for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="764">And...uh...finally, they...they couldn't shoot because they were afraid that if they shoot, they may shoot him, so they didn't shoot.</sentence><sentence id="765">But finally the stupid idiots...uh...came running and...uh...pulled us apart.</sentence><sentence id="766">I am talking about the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, Germans.</sentence><sentence id="767">They pulled us apart.</sentence><sentence id="768">When they pulled us apart, I knew everything is lost.</sentence><sentence id="769">And...uh...I was mainly concerned for the rest of the people.</sentence><sentence id="770">And as I was lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, my...uh...my only satisfaction at that point would be that he would not get a chance to torture me and realize that I am alive, that... that I feel that maybe I would say something to USHMM Archives RG-50.030*250 13 him, or plead and...uh...and this thinking followed actually a outcry from a young girl who became my sister-in-law later.</sentence><sentence id="771">And she cried, she says, "Please somebody help her.</sentence><sentence id="772">Maybe...maybe she just fainted."</sentence><sentence id="773">Well, when I heard that, I...it worried me, "cause I was trying to play dead.</sentence><sentence id="774">Uh...when he heard that, well, if she fainted she's not gonna be alive much longer.</sentence><sentence id="775">And at that point...uh...he took a gun and...uh...the position of my body was evidently so that my head was to the side and evidently when he shot me it was from a angle coming here and going out this way.</sentence><sentence id="776">So it basically grazed my skin and part of my bone since my head was that way.</sentence><sentence id="777">But...nevertheless, I was bleeding a lot and he thought, well, when you get a shot right in the forehead like that, how can you live?</sentence><sentence id="778">So...and I did not move.</sentence><sentence id="779">Uh...in the meantime, all this took a long time and it was in afternoon, September, and it was getting darker and it evidently spoiled his...uh...timing because...uh... uh...they turned on the search light already, and on top of everything else they were bombing.</sentence><sentence id="780">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> were started flying over the <span class="REGION">area</span> and there was bombing.</sentence><sentence id="781">They did not hit us, but they were evidently bombing the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I mention to you later about the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> being bombed and so on.</sentence><sentence id="782">Well, they quickly turned off the search light and (cough) they...uh...uh...chased everybody in to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, together with the other ones.</sentence><sentence id="783">Now I was dead on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, so I had to remain there. (</sentence><sentence id="784">Cough) I am sorry.</sentence><sentence id="785">Well, I immediately realized that I wasn't hurt badly, that I was not near anything similar to being...uh...dead or anything like like that and since | realized that there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I didn't even know exactly because I had to keep my eyes closed not to give myself away, so I...uh...didn't know what they did with the people.</sentence><sentence id="786">I thought, "Well, all is lost.</sentence><sentence id="787">They must have taken them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>."</sentence><sentence id="788">This was my impression, that they were taking them straight to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">Uh...but I saw later on when...when it was completely dark and the search lights came back on, a German...they sent out a German, the same one.</sentence><sentence id="790">I mean the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>...uh...to make sure I was dead.</sentence><sentence id="791">And I was still in the same <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="792">Uh...And he came to me and he wanted to play smarty.</sentence><sentence id="793">He wanted to see if I have pulse.</sentence><sentence id="794">To this day a doctor has difficulties finding pulse, so he didn't find it.</sentence><sentence id="795">But then he...he did another trick.</sentence><sentence id="796">He picked my arm up and then all of a sudden I felt a release, so I dropped it like it was a piece of wood.</sentence><sentence id="797">He shouldn't realize that I was alive.</sentence><sentence id="798">Then he started searching me here for money and valuables.</sentence><sentence id="799">Well, I could not help it.</sentence><sentence id="800">I could not move because that would be the end of me again.</sentence><sentence id="801">Well, whatever he found he did, but he did not take my photographs. (</sentence><sentence id="802">Laughter) I had the photographs.</sentence><sentence id="803">Uh...And then he left, satisfied that I was dead.</sentence><sentence id="804">He wouldn't waste another bullet, because...uh...why waste another bullet where he could use it for somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="805">So...uh...between the search lights I realized that the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were there.</sentence><sentence id="806">I says, "Well, the only thing that I can do is just get under the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>."</sentence><sentence id="807">Little by little, I got myself under the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they were even lower than my body could part...take it, so I had to possibly squeeze myself in.</sentence><sentence id="808">I felt, every time I breathed, I felt that I'm raising the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, but I heard foot steps.</sentence><sentence id="809">I heard voices.</sentence><sentence id="810">I could make out the sounds in Polish and in Yiddish and I said, "Well, who could it be?"</sentence><sentence id="811">Well, I still wasn't very sure.</sentence><sentence id="812">I thought it was just anybody.</sentence><sentence id="813">When morning came, I was still not far from the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and as I saw people coming out and I saw they were wearing...uh...,you know, old shoes and...uh... wooden shoes and they spoke.</sentence><sentence id="814">They were very agitated because of the fact they...uh...witnessed shooting, my parents and relatives, my friends and so on.</sentence><sentence id="815">So naturally, they were all quite agitated.</sentence><sentence id="816">And suddenly, it dawned on me that they were the people.</sentence><sentence id="817">I says, "Well, God, then I have something to look forward to."</sentence><sentence id="818">And I came out.</sentence><sentence id="819">As I <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*250 14 came out...uh...everybody got all excited.</sentence><sentence id="820">My parents were right near the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">My father became white.</sentence><sentence id="822">My...I mean, they were crying after me, and my brother, and then....

say that on occasions, you found a person with feelings and compassion and they did special things.</sentence><sentence id="1167">Maybe it was not a great effort to them, but was a lifesaving to us.</sentence><sentence id="1168">Well, this girl was about my age and...and I went to <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*250 17 her and at that point I looked already like a

here.</sentence><sentence id="1179">That meant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport A</span>, and then the number is 14028.</sentence><sentence id="1180">That was my number.</sentence><sentence id="1181">I went first for them to do it because I wanted to see how it felt.</sentence><sentence id="1182">1 was worrying that mother would not be able to stand it or so.</sentence><sentence

to work.</sentence><sentence id="1192">So, we were in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I saw it...uh ...recently.</sentence><sentence id="1194">It had a <span

told that this what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="1197">I had no idea that they were doing it while I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but that <span class="DLF">steel

come back.</sentence><sentence id="1200">Expression was motionless, but the feelings were there.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And I looked.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Then I went to...they have a

the pictures that I mentioned earlier in my journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> after I was shot that I saved them, I
