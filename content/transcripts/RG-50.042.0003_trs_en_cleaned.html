<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">beep</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: Why don't we start talking about the 1930s, and why don't you tell me how old you were and what you remember of daily life as it was impacted by the Nazi party, how it came into greater and greater power--pogroms, laws...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Now, well actually I think I should start in the, let me see, I was born in 1910, so that would have been around 1930 when the Nazi party really came into being.</sentence><sentence id="4">And I remember that they were then a party #26, we had many, many political parties in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, and they were party #26.</sentence><sentence id="5">They had advantage over other political parties such as the communists and democrats because they had a lot of money backing behind them and when they marched into a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, they had beautiful shiny boots and beautiful uniforms and they marched in military uh formation, whereas, democrats and the communists at that time, they were organized, but they were like a bunch of people running down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, as compared to well-organized march of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="6">We lived at that time in an <span class="REGION">area</span> called ----------------- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working class neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">I would say, very largely communist, not necessarily party members, but certainly sympathizers.</sentence><sentence id="8">There was one particular day I remember quite vividly, when the Nazis decided they wanted to march down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, by the thousands incidentally.</sentence><sentence id="9">And, we...didn't exactly like the idea, this was our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, our turf.</sentence><sentence id="10">There was a lot of shooting.</sentence><sentence id="11">Machine guns had been mounted on <span class="DLF">roofs</span>, would shoot into the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">Group, and so forth, and that became a very bloody affair.</sentence><sentence id="13">This was only one time.</sentence><sentence id="14">I guess it, I'm not quite sure about the date, but it was in 1930, a very early 1930.</sentence><sentence id="15">I was involved in many of the anti-Nazi street fights, and ----------, I was never a member of a party really, but certainly a sympathizer.</sentence><sentence id="16">But then I was only 20 years old or 21 years old, so I had a lot of things that I wouldn't do today.</sentence><sentence id="17">And, it is generally assumed that the Holocaust, and it rightly so, actually started until 1942, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> came into being, but that's not really quite true, not in my opinion because the first boycott of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> happened in April 30, 1932!</sentence><sentence id="18">Where they took all, this is a long time before the holocaust started, as per se holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="19">They uh, boycotted the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>, put the name "juden" on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and so forth, and they marched in front of those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> for prevent customers from going in, but there were many people, I remember very vividly, one</sentence><sentence id="21">particular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we lived in was a <span class="BUILDING">cigar store</span>, it sold cigars and cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="22">I know, my neighbors went in there, they never smoked a cigarette in their life, they just went in there to spite the Nazi movement at that time, they were not very much in favor of it.</sentence><sentence id="23">But we have to put this in a proper context, things were very bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">Unemployment was perhaps, I'm not sure of this now, but I would say perhaps 20% people weren't working, there, there was no jobs to be had, and as time went on, they became more and more sympathetic to the Nazi movement, first, I would imagine, for economic reasons and secondly, it became very popular to be antisemitic because it was easiest thing in the world, if you want to hate somebody, the Jews are always around!</sentence><sentence id="25">They can be hated.</sentence><sentence id="26">So, in my opinion, the actual holocaust, with the exception of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, started in 1932, and, as I said before, April the 30th.</sentence><sentence id="27">A group of young men, friends of mine, we used to hang around together, we were quite active in dancing and all this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="28">We decided we're going to join the army.</sentence><sentence id="29">It was not an army, it was called uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitz</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitz</span>, Arbeiten, I don't recall exactly the name of it.</sentence><sentence id="30">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, in which we had regular military training except for weapons.</sentence><sentence id="31">That was against the Versailles Treaty at that time, which had been still obeyed then.</sentence><sentence id="32">We had no weapons, but we marched in military formation and, and we used uh, uh spades, shovels, as rifles, which marching and all this kind of thing, we had a regular military training.</sentence><sentence id="33">At that time that I went in there, it was, nobody asked me if I was Jewish, and I didn't mention it, so we all got accepted into this uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">Somehow or other, I don't recall how, they found out that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="35">I was sta-uh stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marineburg</span>, <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span>, which was right near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span>, also in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.184554" long="19.545083">Elbing</span> then was German, but it had been independent uh earlier.</sentence><sentence id="36">It's been kicked back and forth between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for many years.</sentence><sentence id="37">We marched from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marineburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span>, which was, I'd say, about 30 kilometers, and we stood guard for Hitler, and I claimed to have very distinct, uh, I don't know what I should call it.</sentence><sentence id="38">I probably was the only Jew in the world that ever stood guard for Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="39">I saw him as close as I see you right in front of me now.</sentence><sentence id="40">He was making a speech at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span>, and as he walked by us, reviewing the troops, he was a little man, everyone knows the mustache and his hairdo, and he looked perfectly calm and we stood out there waiting for him to finish, which took about 3 hours.</sentence><sentence id="41">When he came out, and he marched by us again toward his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, the man looked, and I remember this very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="42">He looked as, like a maniac, he talked himself into a total frenzy.</sentence><sentence id="43">I don't believe that he even knew what he was speaking about anymore, because he was, he looked a, a person that has not control over his emotions anymore.</sentence><sentence id="44">It was found out somehow or other, as I said before, that I was Jewish, and I was discharged from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">I must have been in there, I don't remember exactly, I'd say close to a year.</sentence><sentence id="46">This was in 1932.</sentence><sentence id="47">Nothing much happened between 1932 and 1935 except the regular political uh marches through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> that they weren't wanted and so forth, and in the meantime, the Nazi party grew, and grew in popularity.</sentence><sentence id="48">A lot of the German fellows, young fellows, they weren't really antisemitic or anti anything, but they had</sentence><sentence id="50">nothing to do, they had no jobs, and here, they come around they give them a beautiful pair of boots, and they give them a nice shirt and a pair of britches, and have a gun in your hip, you know, you can go out and shoot somebody, it's okay, you'll get away with it.</sentence><sentence id="51">Now, that became very popular, but in 1935, actually it was September 15, a new law came into being, and that a German family could not have a gentile maid, there were many Jewish families were quite wealthy too, and they had a maid, a live-in maid.</sentence><sentence id="52">They could not have a live-in maid under the age of 55, for apparently, obvious reasons.</sentence><sentence id="53">They also at the same time a law took effect that did not allow a Jewish person, male or female, to go with a Gentile person, male or female.</sentence><sentence id="54">At that time, I was going with a nice young lady that I had gone with for some time, and we were out camping, I remember very well, I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kayak</span>, and we went out camping near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and there was a fellow and, next to us, near us, in another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>, we slept in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">He wanted to make a date with this young lady that I was going with, and she didn't want any part of it.</sentence><sentence id="56">He reported me to, to the Gestapo, and I was arrested for going with a gentile girl.</sentence><sentence id="57">I got six months in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, solitary confinement in 1935.</sentence><sentence id="58">When I was released, I became known as a habitual criminal in the eyes of the Nazi party.</sentence><sentence id="59">I was a habitual criminal.</sentence><sentence id="60">I never did anything criminal in my life, but as far as they're concerned, being, doing something against the law was enough to make me a habitual criminal.</sentence><sentence id="61">As a result of that image that was put on us, I was arrested again 3 years later, on June 14, 1938 at 4 o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="62">We had gone to a birthday party of my sister in law.</sentence><sentence id="63">I was already married.</sentence><sentence id="64">I had a baby, my wife was pregnant again.</sentence><sentence id="65">Four o'clock in the morning there's a banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">We woke up, we said, "What are they?</sentence><sentence id="67">Crazy?</sentence><sentence id="68">They want to continue the party 4 o'clock in the morning?"</sentence><sentence id="69">And I yelled, "Go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span>!</sentence><sentence id="70">That's enough!"</sentence><sentence id="71">And the banging persisted and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and there came 2 plain clothes men with guns, "You're under arrest." "</sentence><sentence id="72">Under arrest?</sentence><sentence id="73">What for?</sentence><sentence id="74">I didn't do anything."</sentence><sentence id="75">No questions asked.</sentence><sentence id="76">I said, "Would you mind getting out so my wife can get up?"</sentence><sentence id="77">He says, "Oh, that won't bother us."</sentence><sentence id="78">I said, "It may bother her."</sentence><sentence id="79">So, they stepped outside the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I got up, I got dressed, they took me to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> near the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Okay, why don't we back up to the point where at 4 in the morning, they came knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, so go right back to that point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="170">I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, two plain clothes...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Do the whole knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and back up a little tiny bit more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="176">We had gone to a birthday party on June the 14th, so some friends of ours who had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, must have been about midnight, somewhere around midnight.</sentence><sentence id="177">Four o clock in the morning, we had a banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I thought those were our friends coming back to continue the celebration.</sentence><sentence id="178">I said, "Come on, go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, it's enough already.</sentence><sentence id="179">You know, 4 0 clock, got to work tomorrow."</sentence><sentence id="180">The knocking persisted, I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and two plain clothes men with guns came in to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, "You're under arrest." "</sentence><sentence id="181">Under arrest?</sentence><sentence id="182">What for?</sentence><sentence id="183">I didn't do anything."</sentence><sentence id="184">No questions asked.</sentence><sentence id="185">They didn't push us around at that point.</sentence><sentence id="186">I was, I got dressed, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we were.</sentence><sentence id="187">I got into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> perhaps as large as this one right here.</sentence><sentence id="188">There must have been 2 or 300 people in there, and we didn't know what was going on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="189">"What are you, what are you here for?" "</sentence><sentence id="190">I don't know, I didn't do anything."</sentence><sentence id="191">We didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="192">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="193">We had absolutely no idea what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="194">All we knew, we were under arrest.</sentence><sentence id="195">Around 7 0 clock or 6 0 clock in the morning, they loaded us all on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and they took it to a remote <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foulsborough</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">It's a name, it's in a, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were supported by a police--well, those are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">storm trooper cars</span>, not really <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police cars</span>, the private police had nothing to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="198">They had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and one on each side with bloodhounds.</sentence><sentence id="199">To be facetious, they wanted to be sure nobody gets lost, you know.</sentence><sentence id="200">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, and we were loaded, we were loaded into regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, as what happened later.</sentence><sentence id="201">We were not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, we went in a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and then, several hours of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, we didn't where we, we had no idea what was happening, and you can imagine some older people, I was just a young fellow, but there were some older people--started crying, we didn't know, what did we do?</sentence><sentence id="202">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, they loaded us back on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> again, no that is not correct.</sentence><sentence id="203">We went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.748639" long="13.236928">Oranienburg</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">How far outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="205">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, they shoved us all out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and we began to march towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">We still didn't know what was going to be, we had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="207">Along the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, some, we had to run, there was no walking.</sentence><sentence id="208">One particular incident I recall (pause) like it was yesterday, an old gentleman with the name of Solomon, I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="209">He must have been well in his 70s, he simply couldn't run.</sentence><sentence id="210">He couldn't run, he had to walk.</sentence><sentence id="211">He couldn't run and he collapsed, and he laid in the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and one of the storm troopers, a tall young fellow, very slender, very tall, stepped on this throat (blows his nose), this is true.</sentence><sentence id="212">Unbelievable but true, till the man was dead.</sentence><sentence id="213">We had to pick up his body, and throw him to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and we continued on into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where we were assembled in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and a strange incident happened at that time.</sentence><sentence id="214">We faced a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the right, a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">left.</sentence><sentence id="218">People went in the left <span class="DLF">door</span>, came out the right <span class="DLF">door</span>, entirely different people.</sentence><sentence id="219">Their hair was shaven off, they had a prisoner's uniform on, the very wide striped uniform.</sentence><sentence id="220">My number was 6199.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="221">A strange thing happened as I mentioned before.</sentence><sentence id="222">My parents were separated.</sentence><sentence id="223">I hadn't seen my father, and he was my step father I must say, in perhaps 8 years, maybe 9 years, right after I was bar mitvahed, my parents separated for a specific reason, and I hadn't seen him in all these years, and I saw him, met him in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="224">It was uh, hard to describe the emotion.</sentence><sentence id="225">My father was a very, very big man, he weighed 350 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="226">And I introduced myself, he didn't recognize me of course.</sentence><sentence id="227">And we became a family again.</sentence><sentence id="228">While we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I tried to take care of him as much as I could.</sentence><sentence id="229">There wasn't too much that I can, could do at the time, but, I just have to mention it because this all relates to a very traumatic experiences in my life.</sentence><sentence id="230">We worked ten hours a day if I remember correctly.</sentence><sentence id="231">We slept on straw, on strawbacks, it was a uh jude sack filled with straw.</sentence><sentence id="232">I guess that's common uh you know, under certain circumstances, many people sleep that way, and we worked 10 hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="233">On a <span class="DLF">field</span> that was approximately a square kilometer, somewhere around that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">One area of this <span class="DLF">field</span> was quite high, the other <span class="REGION">area</span> was quite low.</sentence><sentence id="235">The <span class="REGION">area</span> had to be leveled, and what was done was they had <span class="DLF">tracks</span> running from one end to the other.</sentence><sentence id="236">On those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">Now in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining car</span> is square.</sentence><sentence id="238">Over there a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining car</span> is a triangular shape.</sentence><sentence id="239"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Steel mining cars</span>, and each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had about ten of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span> on it.</sentence><sentence id="240">On each one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span> storm trooper was standing with a re--and we had to run from one end of this <span class="DLF">field</span> to the other, shovel the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cart</span> full of dirt, and return to empty it out on the lower end.</sentence><sentence id="241">If anyone would have told me at that time that I can run 40 kilometers a day, I'd say you're crazy.</sentence><sentence id="242">But I did.</sentence><sentence id="243">Day after day after day.</sentence><sentence id="244">The food was barely edible, I remember one particular incident, it so happens I hate broccoli, and they had broccoli soup for 3 days in a row, and for 3 days in a row I didn't eat anything, just dry bread.</sentence><sentence id="245">The other prisoners gave me some of their bread.</sentence><sentence id="246">They ate the soup, I got the bread.</sentence><sentence id="247">I just couldn't eat it because if I had I would have gotten sick.</sentence><sentence id="248">Psychological?</sentence><sentence id="249">Certainly, but I'm entitled.</sentence><sentence id="250">At one time, they assembled us in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">They had <span class="BUILDING">machine gun towers</span> all the way around, and they were shooting machine gun bullets over our head, maybe a foot above our head, and they said, they made a, the commander made a speech, they said that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, this was the time of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> taking over the-------------- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">They said if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gets involved in the war because of -------------, these machine guns will be lowered and we're going to kill you all.</sentence><sentence id="253">We, we were hoping that this wasn't going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="254">Perhaps, many people will recall a Christian pastor with the name of Niemoller.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="255">He was arrested from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> in a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> somewhere in <span class="REGION">Midwestern Germany</span> because he simply didn't believe in the Nazi doctrine, and he was preaching openly against it, and he was arrested and put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it became like an international incident at the time.</sentence><sentence id="256">I met him in -------- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">What they did to this man, one human being doing this to another, is beyond description.</sentence><sentence id="258">This man in the perhaps 6 months that he was in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, aged 25 years.</sentence><sentence id="259">Perhaps I</sentence><sentence id="261">shouldn't say this, but they literally made him eat his own waste, but he lived through it because he had very strong faith.</sentence><sentence id="262">I just mention this to convey what one human being can do to another.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="263">When you read this in a book it's one thing, when you see it and it actually happens it's quite another, I assure you.</sentence><sentence id="264">While I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I had pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="265">The commander used to come in and inspect the <span class="INT_SPACE">sleeping quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>, we only had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and other than that, we stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, there was no anywhere where we could relax or assemble, no way.</sentence><sentence id="267">And he used to hold his nose, "Uh, these Jews stink, I can't stand it."</sentence><sentence id="268">This of course is all in German.</sentence><sentence id="269">One time, we were assembled, and I always tried to make it my business to stay in a <span class="INT_SPACE">back row</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">We always had 3 or 4 rows of soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="271">I tried to stay in

and Herring and Hitler and Goering and all of those people, and Rosenberg, and Hess, but only in passing, when they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to visit.</sentence><sentence id="551">You talked about antisemitism and you talked about being more German or being more Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="552">Talk to me about that.</sentence><sentence id="553">No, I didn't quite mean it that way.</sentence><sentence id="554">To the best of my knowledge, my family has lived and was</sentence><sentence id="556">born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for 400 years.</sentence><sentence id="557">I, at one time, many years ago, went through a certain procedure with the American Red Cross, and they found out how far we went back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and while I was always very Jewish, my nationality wasn't Jewish, my nationality was German.</sentence><sentence id="558">I was born there, my parents, grandparents, great grandparents, I don't know how far back.</sentence><sentence id="559">They were all born, as a consequently we weren't Jewish first, we were German first.</sentence><sentence id="560">I must say, I feel the same way about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="561">I'm American first and Jewish second, and I think anyone should be that way.</sentence><sentence id="562">I think you're <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> comes first.</sentence><sentence id="563">Who was it that said, "My <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right or wrong, my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>."</sentence><sentence id="564">And that's how I feel about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">And at the time, I didn't know any different.</sentence><sentence id="566">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I was born there and lived there, and I was German.</sentence><sentence id="567">Being Jewish was my religion, which had nothing to do with the nationality at that time.</sentence><sentence id="568">See, we didn't know any different.</sentence><sentence id="569">We didn't make a special point of being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="570">I was brought up in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and all of that, and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, but there was no special em--uh, no special emphasis made out of that.</sentence><sentence id="571">It was just a normal way to live.</sentence><sentence id="572">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="573">We have to reload.</sentence><sentence id="574"><span class="BUILDING">Wentworth Films</span>; Holocaust; 7-1/2 IPS; 60 cycle sync; 2/27/92; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tamarac</span>, Florida; Continuing interview with Edward Adler.</sentence><sentence id="575"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">People say that Jews went like sheep to the slaughter.</sentence><sentence id="578">I'm sure you've heard that.</sentence><sentence id="579">How do you feel about that?Uh, at the time that the actual slaughter happened, I was already in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="580">But, I have to refer to a statement I made earlier, when I equate a certain situation with <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span>, when Mussolini went in there, and the Ethiopians were fighting with slingshots against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="581">I like to say to the people who make that kind of a statement, that Jews went to the <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouse</span> like sheep.</sentence><sentence id="582">How do you fight machine guns and submachine guns with your bare hands?</sentence><sentence id="583">I'd like, I'd like them to tell me how this can be when you're surrounded by hundreds of storm troopers with heavy weapons, and you stand there naked.</sentence><sentence id="584">Men, women and children in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="585">How do you expect to fight back?</sentence><sentence id="586">That's a very, very foolish statement.</sentence><sentence id="587">They did not go willingly I assure you.</sentence><sentence id="588">That's a very,</sentence><sentence id="590">very foolish thing to say, and I get very emotional about that, when somebody says that thing.</sentence><sentence id="591">They stand in that <span class="DLF">yard</span>, naked men, women, and children, surrounded by machine guns and submachine guns, and they, people expect them to fight back?</sentence><sentence id="592">You don't have the strength to fight.</sentence><sentence id="593">You don't have the emotion to fight.</sentence><sentence id="594">You are scared stiff.</sentence><sentence id="595">Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.</sentence><sentence id="596">Those people who make that kind of a statement, they have never been in a situation like this.</sentence><sentence id="597">Ob-ob-obviously otherwise they wouldn't say anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="598">You can't fight that.</sentence><sentence id="599">Whether they wanted to or not.</sentence><sentence id="600">But the fight should have started before, when the world knew from 1932 that antisemitism became very, very strong and, and ultimately they must have known or should have known what will happen.</sentence><sentence id="601">Nobody came to our aid, nobody helped the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="602">They help everybody else, but the Jews, they're very expendable, they don't mean nothing.</sentence><sentence id="603">We had been crossing through----------------5,000 years, and nobody ever came to our help.</sentence><sentence id="604">And those days, certainly, not, the whole world stood by and, I can't believe for a moment, well, I have to make another statement that just came back to me.</sentence><sentence id="605">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">St. Louis</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">St. Louis</span>, and came into Miami Harbor with 856 men, women and children aboard, and our beloved President Roosevelt sent them back to certain death, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">What's the excuse for that?</sentence><sentence id="607">I mean the president couldn't invoke his executive to aid, to save 856 lives?</sentence><sentence id="608">856 lives!</sentence><sentence id="609">In this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of then 132 million people.</sentence><sentence id="610">And they sent them back to certain <span class="NPIP">death</span>.</sentence><sentence id="611">And I know people come and ask me why we didn't fight back.</sentence><sentence id="612">Come on.</sentence><sentence id="613">One thing you said was what a waste of the Nazis did on extermination.</sentence><sentence id="614">What a what they did on?Waste, they wasted, they spent so much effort and intelligence and effort on...Yes, they did.</sentence><sentence id="615">Well, that was the plan after the Wannsee Conference.</sentence><sentence id="616">Prior to that, I don't believe, uh, I don't believe, I'm not sure, I don't believe that it was in the Nazi doctrine to eliminate the Jews as arace.</sentence><sentence id="617">I do believe that they wanted them to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="618">They didn't want the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but I don't think the killing was part of their philosophy at the time, that came later.</sentence><sentence id="619">So as long, like in my case for instance, and many, many others, many, many others, I'm certainly not unique in any way, uh (coughs), excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="620">At that time, as I said before, if they wanted you to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, they did let you out.</sentence><sentence id="621">And many people went to, all over the world, they went to, I have cousins that went to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> because they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to live, or nobody wanted them, <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> didn't want them, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> didn't want them, nobody wanted them.</sentence><sentence id="622">Why?</sentence><sentence id="623">Because we're</sentence><sentence id="625">Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="626">Eh, nobody wants the Jews, they're filth.</sentence><sentence id="627">It's a terrible thing, but the world is to blame for that, not one <span class="BUILDING">govt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="628">I don't believe that the killing was part of their original plan, that came afterwards, I think.</sentence><sentence id="629">No, no way of proving it, it's just my opinion.</sentence><sentence id="630">What happened to your parents?</sentence><sentence id="631">And, do you want to talk about other members of your family?Yes.</sentence><sentence id="632">As I said before, my parents were separated.</sentence><sentence id="633">This was my stepfather.</sentence><sentence id="634">My first, oh yeah, let me give you my life story.</sentence><sentence id="635">My real father I never knew, so I'm the subject of twice-broken <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, as actually, it didn't turn out too bad really.</sentence><sentence id="636">My real father I never knew, he left my mother with 3 children and she never heard from him again.</sentence><sentence id="637">I was then 2 years old.</sentence><sentence id="638">I never saw him in my life.</sentence><sentence id="639">I don't what he did, I don't know anything about him.</sentence><sentence id="640">All I know is his name.</sentence><sentence id="641">My mother remarried when I was 7 years old, and there was specific that they did not stay together.</sentence><sentence id="642">They separated when I was, it was after my <span class="BUILDING">bar</span>, my bar mitzvah, I'd say I was about 15 years old, so it must have been somewhere around 1925 or so, they separated, and I hadn't seen my father ever in the meantime, except at the time when I got into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> when I met him.</sentence><sentence id="643">MY mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">She was shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="645">I know this from 2 <span class="NPIP">sources</span>.</sentence><sentence id="646">First from the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="647">Many years ago we made an inquiry from the --------------, actually, not the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="648">And I also have a cousin who now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="649">I'm not sure that he's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="650">He was an electrician and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> also and he saw my mother.</sentence><sentence id="651">He wasn't killed because he was useful, he was an electrician by trade, so he, he stayed alive, and eventually wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="652">Was married and had children, but I don't know anything about him, but my mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in 1942 I believe.</sentence><sentence id="653">My sister was married, had 2 children.</sentence><sentence id="654">She was killed by bombs.</sentence><sentence id="655">They found her body and they got her the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="656">With her husband and her son.</sentence><sentence id="657">She also had a daughter that by now must be in her 50s, I would imagine, like my children, or maybe a little bit older, but, went somewhere into the <span class="REGION">farming area</span>, but I don't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="658">When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> in 1982, incidentally, it's very interesting, we were invited by the German government all expenses paid, including spending money every day, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="659">At first, I didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="660">I said, "I don't want any part of this."</sentence><sentence id="661">We were in, well, let me go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="662">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1972.</sentence><sentence id="663">And while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="664">Just for one day, my wife wanted to see my <span class="DLF">mother's grave</span>, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">And I cracked up totally .Everything came back to me.</sentence><sentence id="666">I remember, I wanted take a -----------, we got into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span>, never forget it, I was terrible, I was terrible, not uh the situation, I was terrible, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TV</span> wasn't, I didn't know how to put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TV</span> on, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span>, and some German guy you know,</sentence><sentence id="668">came in and put it on, and he said, "Well, you Americans, you don't know anything."</sentence><sentence id="669">I threw him out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I became almost wild.</sentence><sentence id="670">Couldn't stand it.</sentence><sentence id="671">We only stayed that one day, so when this 10 years later, when we got the invitation to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I didn't want to go, I said to my wife, "I, L, I, I'm not going to go, I get sick and all that.</sentence><sentence id="672">Then I reconsidered as time went on, I said, "You know, the hell with, we can take side trips, we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="673">They paid all expenses.</sentence><sentence id="674">The lady that was in charge, I must say, we stayed in a very fine <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">The lady that was in charge was a very, very nice lady.</sentence><sentence id="676">You could really see that she felt what we went through, and that, I mean, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had at one time, I don't know, I think 60,000 Jews or something like that, was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, 3 million people, we had about 60,000 Jews, there was nothing left, and all the big <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> that used to be owned by Jewish people are now, have now been taken over by the Nazi party those days, and eventually probably through generation their father, grandfather now owns it or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="677">And this lady felt very sorry for us, she, they, I asked her, "What's the purpose of inviting us?</sentence><sentence id="678">Do you expect anyone to change his mind to come back to live here after living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for 50 years?"</sentence><sentence id="679">She says, "No, no.</sentence><sentence id="680">That's not really the purpose.</sentence><sentence id="681">It is perhaps, to ease our conscience a bit.".</sentence><sentence id="682">That was her statement.</sentence><sentence id="683">We stayed there for I think 10 days, it was very nice, really very nice, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">It was 75% destroyed, and after war, through the Marshall Plan, naturally American money, we built it up again into beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, it really is a very beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="685">Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="686">I asked everything I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="687">Thank You.</sentence><sentence id="688">All right.</sentence><sentence id="689">We have to do one other <span class="NPIP">thing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="690">We have to, actually we can't do it till the coffee stops perking, probably, thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="691">Your welcome.</sentence><sentence id="692">I hope L..It was very....The following will be 30 seconds of room tone for interview
