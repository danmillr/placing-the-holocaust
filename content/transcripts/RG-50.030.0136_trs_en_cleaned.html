had to have be safe.</sentence><sentence id="849">And just coach them in what their new identity was.</sentence><sentence id="850">I have often said that if I had known then what I have since learned,

functioned.</sentence><sentence id="852">And it was just a matter of saving lives, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="853">And I remember taking these -- I don't know how many children -- and

id="860">And they would then be handed over to somebody else, and gotten into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">And kids came day and night, and we changed their identity.</sentence><sentence id="862">I remember most I remember two incidents that I want to relate.</sentence><sentence id="863">One of the source of help was the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic

given an address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> as my original.</sentence><sentence id="1330">I had my identification card.</sentence><sentence id="1331">I didn't even know where the <span class="DLF">street</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1332">I didn't even know whether it existed.</sentence><sentence id="1333">If they had asked me to take them there, I couldn't have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1334">But they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1335">So I left this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1336">they imprisoned Charlotte, but we managed to liberate her to help her escape.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And she's still living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1389">Q: How did you help her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1391">A: I don't -- we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1392">I wasn't part of that.</sentence><sentence id="1393">The resident workers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> managed.</sentence><sentence id="1394">I don't know how they did it.</sentence><sentence id="1395">I haven't the slightest idea.</sentence><sentence id="1396">I was very anxious to retrieve my knapsack, which had a lot of incriminating papers in it.</sentence><sentence id="1397">And so I got in touch with another worker, who first went to where my knapsack was parked -- I don't remember where -- and got out all the stuff that was in there that would have been incriminating.</sentence><sentence id="1398">And then I got my knapsack back, and then I went back on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> 75 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1399">Now, just a few 7 years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, I met a woman who, when we're introduced to each other, says, "Oh, I know who you are.</sentence><sentence id="1400">You spent the night.</sentence><sentence id="1401">You were arrested in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1402">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1403">I have absolutely no memory of it.</sentence><sentence id="1404">She remembered the incident.</sentence><sentence id="1405">She remembers Charlotte, and how she and Paulette and another young woman rescued Charlotte.</sentence><sentence id="1406">I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="1407">I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="1408">But for me, I was anxious to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> with my cleansed knapsack.</sentence><sentence id="1409">I remember this as a straight route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1410">And I took it a few years back, and it was the rollercoast-- the worst <span class="DLF">rollercoaster road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1411">And my husband said to me, "This is a straight <span class="DLF">road</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1412">In my memory, this was a straight <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1413">So I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And no sooner did I get to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that my landlady says, "Your friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> came to see you, and you were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1415">Needless to say that I spent no time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span>, and took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span>, where I had somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="1416">But you see, it wasn't always <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1417">Whenever we could, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">luggage compartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">And we went as far as we could on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, on where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Maquis</span> had blown up the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>, we had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="1419">We were always rejoicing when the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were blown up.</sentence><sentence id="1420">So we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, and we went a little bit further.</sentence><sentence id="1421">So that way, we, we traveled.</sentence><sentence id="1422">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bourges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1423">And I even remember getting a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> part of the way, putting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the back, and getting there until things calmed down until my friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> were, were sure that I was somewhat safe.</sentence><sentence id="1424">There's another crazy incident that I do remember, is that I had mentioned earlier that the head of the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span> was the Commissar de Police from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032" long="7.749989">Strasbourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1425">He ended up being the Commissar de Police of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span>, where I was doing underground work.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And I did something which today seems absolutely crazy to me.</sentence><sentence id="1427">I went to him.</sentence><sentence id="1428">And I told him, "I know you know who I am."</sentence><sentence id="1429">But I told him that I was working under a false name, and what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And I was expecting him to leave me alone.</sentence><sentence id="1431">In retrospect, it sounds absolutely totally crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1432">But he never bothered me.</sentence><sentence id="1433">It so happened that after the war as soon as the war was over, and when you know, when they sought out the collaborators, he came to me begging for some kind of, you know, "See what I did for you?!"</sentence><sentence id="1434">But at that time I went to my superiors at OSE, who says, "He doesn't deserve any, any kind of consideration because if he hadn't been the, the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp of Rivesaltes</span> and he hadn't accepted that job, it would have been, you know, more to his credit."</sentence><sentence id="1435">So, but this is the -- so but this is the -- so you asked me earlier, "How did it feel?"</sentence><sentence id="1436">I got a sense of invulnerability.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Of -- I had to do a job; and you do it with some kind of daring.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And you, you feel I could wear these uniforms of Red Cross, or doing and, and just pretend and do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1439">And I didn't feel it was anything terribly unusual, because I saw all my peers doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1440">All my peers from the youth movement did the same kind of work, whether it was in the in the escape, the routes to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- or whether it was in the in the Maquis.</sentence><sentence id="1441">Whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1442">We did it because that was the thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="1443">That brings us pretty much to almost the end of the war -- no. [</sentence><sentence id="1444">remember D-Day -- June 6th, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="1445">I thought it was all over.</sentence><sentence id="1446">It wasn't over by far.</sentence><sentence id="1447">And I put my the gold little flag on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, but very quickly put it back in.</sentence><sentence id="1448">You see, I had lived as really with these two ladies, who took me for a very good Catholic girl.</sentence><sentence id="1449">In fact, I had a rosary, and I had went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday morning in 8 the back of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1450">But anyway, it was too early to really tell them.</sentence><sentence id="1451">I was I was just exploding with telling the truth, but we couldn't because as the in, you know, as the Allies had landed, that didn't mean at all that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And then the fierce battling went on -- the bombings.</sentence><sentence id="1453">I was part of the Red Cross emergency teams, where we went when there were bombings, picking people out from under the rubble.</sentence><sentence id="1454">This was just a civil service of a some job that I didn't do as part of my underground work or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1455">It was just a community work.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And that went on.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And as reprisals, very nearby was this horrible incident of Oradour-sur-Glane, where the Germans locked up the whole population in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and put fire to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1458">This was non-Jews as well as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1459">I mean, it had nothing to do -- they had just to do with the psychology of an army that was losing the war and went and arresting more Jews and more kids that came our way.</sentence><sentence id="1460">But don't ask me the details of how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1461">I know it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I know we did it.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I know I did it, but I don't remember the details.</sentence><sentence id="1464">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1465">More kids coming, and I know we placed more kids.</sentence><sentence id="1466">It was just a frenzy of, of, of needs at that time, until finally the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="1467">I, I know this was a, a very hectic period.</sentence><sentence id="1468">I remember -- one more thing is this team of, of Jewish girls celebrating Passover that spring, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1469">And one of us watching, standing guard at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, just like Marrano-type kind of celebration.</sentence><sentence id="1470">These, some of these little details come up once in a while.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But I have mulled over and over and with great guilt, really, as to why I don't remember individual children and individual stories.</sentence><sentence id="1472">With very few exceptions, I don't.</sentence><sentence id="1473">My sister-in-law, those of my cousins.</sentence><sentence id="1474">And the only explanation I can come up with is that the fear of getting attached or the inability to get attached to individuals, for fear of loss, for fear of getting too close.</sentence><sentence id="1475">And so that I do not remember individual stories, with the few exceptions that I gave you.</sentence><sentence id="1476">Also is I left the United -- I left <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1946, after filling a couple of years very briefly.</sentence><sentence id="1477">And I had one urge and that is to put everything I cut even loose from the people I worked with during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I never spoke French to my children, never talked about any of that story.</sentence><sentence id="1479">It was all something to put behind me.</sentence><sentence id="1480">And it's not until about 10, 12 years ago or so that I became part of, of those of us who feel a responsibility of, of telling our individual stories.</sentence><sentence id="1481">When the war was over in our in my <span class="REGION">area</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateauroux</span>, in the fall of 19-- oh, just before the High Holy Days in 1944, when I remember getting my cousins out of that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, and I remember getting anyway, I just went there and got them and put them on God knows what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1482">And from one <span class="NPIP">stage</span> to the other, and got them back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1483">Because that my, my parents and uncles and aunts were the only living relatives they had, having lost both parents, and leaving them with my family but with very little time to, to spend there.</sentence><sentence id="1484">Because OSE immediately asked me to reopen one of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and I reopened the first <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montintin</span>, in the center of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1485">It was a big old chateau which had been a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> before, but it was closed during all this clandestine period.</sentence><sentence id="1486">And it was populated by rats and by filth.</sentence><sentence id="1487">And we cleaned the rats.</sentence><sentence id="1488">To today, I stand on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> if I 9 see a mouse.</sentence><sentence id="1489">In those days, we put <span class="DLF">traps</span> in, and we caught one rat after another, and we cleansed it.</sentence><sentence id="1490">And it was the most exhilarating kind of experience.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And we got as quickly as we could the children out of the <span class="BUILDING">religious institutions</span>, of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic institutions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And we had no idea yet as to what had happened to their parents, of course, because it wouldn't be until the spring of the following year when the Allies would reach the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> that we really had the reality of what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1493">So we did the best we could to create as quickly as we could a real happy Jewish atmosphere for those children.</sentence><sentence id="1494">With nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1495">With whatever we could.</sentence><sentence id="1496">We had staff survive -- survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1497">I remember particularly one couple from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who had survived.</sentence><sentence id="1498">And I had really a desire to do something in my <span class="DLF">field</span>, and that is, create a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for pre-school children.</sentence><sentence id="1499">Because <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> is, was and has always been -- and continues to be -- my area of interest.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And OSE then replaced, replaced me at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montintin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1501">And I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>; and with another girl, actually, who had worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span> -- but not for OSE, but for the Unitarians.</sentence><sentence id="1502">Jacqueline and I -- who had the same training under the auspices of OSE -- we set up a wonderful model <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for pre-school age children.</sentence><sentence id="1503">Later on, when I read Anna Freud on war and children and infants without family, I realized we really copied -- we copies...no, we didn't copy it.</sentence><sentence id="1504">We initiated the same model.</sentence><sentence id="1505">And these children had survived in hiding -- but not only children who had survived in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1506">Children who were entrusted to us by parents who couldn't handle them.</sentence><sentence id="1507">They had survived themselves, but they were alone.</sentence><sentence id="1508">And for a period of time, we had these children.</sentence><sentence id="1509">But it was also a training school for early childhood educators.</sentence><sentence id="1510">Actually, my diploma was in <span class="BUILDING">Montessori education</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1511">So we set up a Montessori program in, in the -- in a chateau near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, which, by coincidence, happens to be the one where I had taught in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="1512">It was a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span>, surrounded by ground.</sentence><sentence id="1513">And there I stayed until -- this was "45 -- and all the do-gooders from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> came over.</sentence><sentence id="1514">Oh, the most wonderful thing I got is a pair of army shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1515">A WAAC" gave me some shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1516">That was wonderful!</sentence><sentence id="1517">And they brought us candy, and they brought us all kinds of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1518">But the important thing is that I was asked whether I would want to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> to continue my training, to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and continue on with my work.</sentence><sentence id="1519">To tell you the truth, I would have gone blind-folded to the <span class="NPIP">moon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">I would have gone anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1521">This was it.</sentence><sentence id="1522">Was I was ready for a change.</sentence><sentence id="1523">And why me?</sentence><sentence id="1524">Why not Jacqueline?</sentence><sentence id="1525">Jacqueline didn't know English.</sentence><sentence id="1526">She was just as qualified, but I knew English.</sentence><sentence id="1527">This was a scholarship offered by the National Council of Jewish Women, who had set up a program of scholarships to give additional training for people who had worked under these circumstances; in, in Europe, not just in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">And would return to their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to continue to improve the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1529">So I had a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="1530">It's Georges Garel, who actually was wrote paper upon letters upon letters to get me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and I came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">warship</span> in 1946.</sentence><sentence id="1531">And the Council of Jewish Women sent me to <span class="BUILDING">Tulane University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1532">And for one year, but extended my scholarship for a second year, which I completed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>, and got my Master's Degree in social work.</sentence><sentence id="1533">But in the meanwhile, I had met my future husband.</sentence><sentence id="1534">But I did return to degdeg Women's Army Corps (WAC after 1978).</sentence><sentence id="1535">0 <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> before we got married, and worked for the Joint Distribution Committee.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And there I am worked in -- really, at that time, the local agencies who had all these <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> and all these children had to reassess the needs of these children.</sentence><sentence id="1537">And I did survey upon survey of facilities -- not just OSE of various <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> -- to assess their need and to see what else could be done with the children.</sentence><sentence id="1538">And I also set up L'Association des Travailleurs Juives"".</sentence><sentence id="1539">I started with training workers in the various <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, with my newly acquired wisdom in social work.</sentence><sentence id="1540">And I started this program going, going through the JDC.And my commitment was for at least two years, but I was itching to get back and to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And after a year, I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1542">And that's the end of the story, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="1543">I continued in social work for the rest of my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1698">Q: What -- tell us a little bit, if you would, about your adjustment to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1699">What had that year been like when you were here, and what was it like when you returned?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1702">A: Well, when I originally came -- there's two stages there.</sentence><sentence id="1703">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1704">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">Tulane University</span> I found this to be a dilemma, which was far below what I was used to in my own work and in my own experience.</sentence><sentence id="1705">And I didn't feel -- besides, I really had no intention of getting a degree.</sentence><sentence id="1706">It was just a year to be exposed to things here.</sentence><sentence id="1707">So I didn't work very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1708">I was asked to talk about my war experience, and I found it very strange.</sentence><sentence id="1709">Why talk about my war experience?</sentence><sentence id="1710">Everybody else had done it.</sentence><sentence id="1711">And why did I have to talk about it?And yet I did because I was their first student.</sentence><sentence id="1712">And I went to their triennial conventions, and I talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="1713">I don't know what I said and how I told the story then.</sentence><sentence id="1714">There was a lot of publicity.</sentence><sentence id="1715">And it bothered me for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1716">One, because as I said, it seemed so natural to have done that.</sentence><sentence id="1717">I didn't see what was the big fuss, the heroism about it.</sentence><sentence id="1718">Everybody did it, in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="1719">And the other thing is, is the thought of all the children we didn't save.</sentence><sentence id="1720">And how can you sort of make it this beautiful story?</sentence><sentence id="1721">There was just one other thing is that there were there was a program of Ship-a-Box the Council of Jewish Women had.</sentence><sentence id="1722">And I accepted to talk, provided they sent packages overseas.</sentence><sentence id="1723">And that was one of the, you know, redeeming features of my talking.</sentence><sentence id="1724">When I transferred to Case Western -- no.</sentence><sentence id="1725">It wasn't Case Western, it was <span class="BUILDING">Western Reserve University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1726">I got a somewhat different experience.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And yet, I remember my supervisor, or my faculty advisor, never asking me what my experience had been or what, what my expertise.</sentence><sentence id="1728">I mean, after all, I had left 1 was By then, I was 26 years old.</sentence><sentence id="1729">I was not a kid fresh out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1730">I mean, this was <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> because I got credit for all my work I had done.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And I didn't find the academic work any difficult at all.</sentence><sentence id="1732">I didn't find -- what surprised me very much is the true and false kind of multiple choice kinds of things, because I'm not used -- I wasn't used to that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1733">And there was a naivete about people.</sentence><sentence id="1734">I had a sense that they didn't know what life was what real life was about.</sentence><sentence id="1735">It was all textbook kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1736">Until I finally got one supervisor who asked me about -- not about my work during the war, but about my concepts about working with people and children.</sentence><sentence id="1737">And I said, "Finally, somebody feels that we know something there, too."</sentence><sentence id="1738">You * The Association of Jewish Workers (French).</sentence><sentence id="1739">1 know, it's not just in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that they have invented social work, or that we -- to me, it was much too theoretical and so unhum-- it was right and wrong, and there was no nuances.</sentence><sentence id="1740">There were I fought tremendously with my faculty advisor about one particular <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">Social workers were being trained to work in <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I did my field work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bellfaire</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>, which was one of the top-notch child-care agencies.</sentence><sentence id="1742">They were training the social workers who saw the child one hour a week.</sentence><sentence id="1743">To me, it made much more sense to do it the way we did it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and that is, train the house parents who worked with the children on 24 hours a day basis.</sentence><sentence id="1744">And I couldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1745">We would train people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who lived with the children, who were with them all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1746">But we're training a therpa-- a social worker therapist, who saw the child one hour a week.</sentence><sentence id="1747">And that didn't make sense to me.</sentence><sentence id="1748">Does that answer your question?</sentence><sentence id="1749">And but more, I think one of the reasons I was just thinking of something.</sentence><sentence id="1750">One of the reasons I clamed up, too, is that there was such a lack of comprehension as to what really happened.</sentence><sentence id="1751">The questions sometimes were so -- excuse me, but -- stupid.</sentence><sentence id="1752">And it's hard to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1753">It still happens today.</sentence><sentence id="1754">I'll give you an example.</sentence><sentence id="1755">Very recently, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span>, I was asked to talk to a <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1756">A very sweet young teacher had her class read The Diary of Anne Frank.</sentence><sentence id="1757">And could I -- she got my names through the Jewish Federation, because I'm very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1758">And could I come and talk about my own experience?</sentence><sentence id="1759">And I did, at what I hoped it would be <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> level -- which is not particularly my forte, but I tried to tailor it to, to them.</sentence><sentence id="1760">And especially ask questions.</sentence><sentence id="1761">And the kids were wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1762">They really had some very pertinent questions.</sentence><sentence id="1763">The teacher, when I recalled the incident of being arrested and, and Charlotte being put into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, said, "But on what basis did they arrest her?"</sentence><sentence id="1764">And you know I mean, there's this you feel like screaming!</sentence><sentence id="1765">And, and in front of the kids, I didn't want to tell the teacher what kind of question is that.</sentence><sentence id="1766">I said, "This is war.</sentence><sentence id="1767">This is you know, you don't have to have any reason."</sentence><sentence id="1768">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="1769">So in retrospect, I think, also this was one of the reasons maybe I didn't talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1770">The other thing is, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> we really had -- there were some people there was a whole a group of German Jews who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1771">That's how I met my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1772">He's, he's from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1773">He has a whole other saga to tell, but which he wouldn't tell, because he cannot talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1774">But there was a group of what I called people with European background, and as one didn't need to talk about this.</sentence><sentence id="1775">This was really my circle.</sentence><sentence id="1776">One of my very close friends was from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">My husband's friends were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1778">And you didn't have to dwell on these things.</sentence><sentence id="1779">It was part of what you brought with you to your daily living.</sentence><sentence id="1780">And, and I realized, when I started talking about it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> -- it all started when the Council of Jewish Women in Syracuse had a workshop for teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> to teach the Holocaust, to introduce the teaching, whatever that means, teaching the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And I participated in this workshop.</sentence><sentence id="1782">And I became aware, and I began to accept, to recount some of that.</sentence><sentence id="1783">Again there was, you know, when I say "Rivesaltes" to most my, my close friends or the people who come from Europe or come from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, it immediately evokes something.</sentence><sentence id="1784">But then I have to go into the detail as to what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>, why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>, where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>, how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1785">And it's difficult, and there is this lack of background to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1786">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1787">2 When I went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, well, it just so happened that my husband was transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> from "83 to "86.</sentence><sentence id="1788">So I retired from my -- I was teaching at <span class="BUILDING">Upstate Medical Center</span> by then, in the pediatric residency program.</sentence><sentence id="1789">And I left.</sentence><sentence id="1790">I retired.</sentence><sentence id="1791">And my clinical practice as well.</sentence><sentence id="1792">So here I was having all this time, and I reconnected with people that I hadn't seen, with people I had worked with in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1793">And we put together our selected memories.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1795">And I was asked by a group I became active in WIZO" -- which is the equivalent of Hadassah -- which I had never done, because I had never had time for this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1796">But I was very happy to create an educational program for them, and a program of activities; and I was asked to talk about my war experience.</sentence><sentence id="1797">It surprised me.</sentence><sentence id="1798">But then I realized there's a new generation.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And they were mostly Jews from <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>, because the Sephardic community is so much bigger in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> today than it's ever been.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And these Jews had all been coming in the "S0s -- after the war -- and they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1801">Yet, at the same time, there was a physical closeness being there in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And when I said "Rivesaltes," or when I say and name any <span class="NPIP">place</span>, there is some response, which made it easier for me to talk there.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And even to talk here.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And that, that's a reality.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1911">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1912">I'll probably think about it tonight.</sentence><sentence id="1913">I, I want to add that I always find it very difficult to do this, to give these talks in the first person.</sentence><sentence id="1914">And yet I know I've got to do it, because that's the only way people will I've had more people who have heard me talk in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> recently relate to exp-- pieces of experience.</sentence><sentence id="1915">Each one comes away with another little piece, not the whole.</sentence><sentence id="1916">And I think it's important, because I can -- personally, I cannot relate to anything that's fictionalized about the sho'ah,"* the television series on the sho" ah, or anything that's fictionalized in books or in the media, I just can't even watch.</sentence><sentence id="1917">To me, it's not the real stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1918">And so, I suppose that by my talking and sharing it with others, it's the real stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1919">And maybe something remains for them.</sentence><sentence id="1920">I feel that responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="1921">I really do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
