<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: When was the first time that you remember hearing the name Hitler?</sentence><sentence id="180">Granted, you were very young in the 30s.</sentence><sentence id="181">Do you have any memories up til 1939 of your parents talking about this man, or what was happening, how conditions were changing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: [have very vivid memories in 1938 of Hitler, because Hitler speeches were broadcast in the radio, and I remember this frightening voice, and -- and his yelling and screaming, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: And you were only four and a half.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: Correct, but I remember it very vividly because it was frightening me.</sentence><sentence id="188">I mean, I didn't understand the language, but the way he spoke was -- was very frightening.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Did you say anything to your parents, or do you remember them comforting you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: I don't remember them comforting me, I think I -- I said to my parents that -- that this man was a very frightening person, the way he spoke.</sentence><sentence id="195">And we had [coughing] excuse me -- we had a prime minister at the time who was also a great anti-Semite, and I remember -- well, I don't remember the -- the speeches, but I do remember the kinds of -- of expressions he -- he -- he used, which again, were -- were frightening to me, although I was only a youngster.</sentence><sentence id="196">I was a fairly precocious child and I was well aware of some of the politic -- political figures, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and all this.</sentence><sentence id="197">And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me, you know, who was the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, or who was the president of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, or whatever else, and I always knew the answer, even when I was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">So I was sort of regarded as a smart kid, and I-- I was more aware, probably, than an average four or five years old, about what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Okay, let's move now to 1939.</sentence><sentence id="205">Is that the year you said your father lost his <span class="BUILDING">job</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="209">In main of -- May of "39, when the second Jewish law came into effect, my father lost his job, but it was more than that, because that particular law, also allowed what they called people who were not trustworthy for the government.</sentence><sentence id="210">They allowed the government to induct them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">labor brigades</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">And of course,</sentence><sentence id="213">these groups included communists and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="214">And because of that, a number of my uncles, and among them, my father as well, was impacted very shortly.</sentence><sentence id="215">Actually, 1940, my father was inducted into a labor brigade.</sentence><sentence id="216">And they took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia-Ruthenia</span>, which at that time was already occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And they sent him to build <span class="DLF">roads</span>, strategic <span class="DLF">roads</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: When did you say he was taken away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: This -- this was in -- in September of 1940, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="232">And --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: What did he do between the time he lost his job, and being taken away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured a way to go around the -- the laws.</sentence><sentence id="238">According to the laws, which were designed to squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a Jew could not practice business.</sentence><sentence id="239">But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who would then take out the business license, and they would work under him.</sentence><sentence id="240">And in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who was a very kind man.</sentence><sentence id="241">He was a friend of my f-father's, and he volunteer -- he -- he essentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course my father paid him a stipend, and under this -- with this arrangement, my father was able to -- to do that -- some business.</sentence><sentence id="242">Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f -- it was not a formal <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">What -- what they have done, and this is a fairly</sentence><sentence id="245">interesting story, is they -- they went to <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouses</span>, and they met there Jews and non-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and they sold them both things.</sentence><sentence id="246">My father, being an engineer was more familiar with engineering materials, so he -- he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought -- bought them as well.</sentence><sentence id="247">And he had some partners who were -- and business partners who were both Christian and Jew, and that's how he essentially made a living.</sentence><sentence id="248">And bet -- and after "39, he has done that for -- for quite awhile.</sentence><sentence id="249">As you see, he came back after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time.</sentence><sentence id="250">But between 1939 and 1944, he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time, and when he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he was doing this, he was practicing business.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: When you were very young, did you have non-Jewish friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: I did. [</sentence><sentence id="268">remember one, I don't remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="269">My grandparents had a little <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- a little <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, a little <span class="DLF">yard</span> and a -- a small <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span>, about 20 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer -- a <span class="BUILDING">summer cottage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of "40, we went there.</sentence><sentence id="271">My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came out on the weekends and we had some -- I had some next door neighbors, little <span class="DLF">mini- farms</span>, and kids came over, peasant children, and the -- we played.</sentence><sentence id="272">And there was absolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just</sentence><sentence id="274">friends.</sentence><sentence id="275">And -- and as I said, I had a number of them from that -- it was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerdaler(ph</span>) and we had a next door neighbor, was a Serbian couple, and we were very friendly with them, and some others, also.</sentence><sentence id="276">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we lived in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> had a few children.</sentence><sentence id="277">In fact, our next door neighbor had two girls, and the next door neighbor was a professional soldier.</sentence><sentence id="278">He was a -- a -- an officer in the army.</sentence><sentence id="279">And I was extremely friendly with their kids.</sentence><sentence id="280">I was -- if I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I was there, and they sort of regarded me as -- as a family member.</sentence><sentence id="281">When there was Christmas, they had a little gift for me under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">And I have a number of pictures with the -- with the two girls.</sentence><sentence id="283">One was my age, and the other was a couple of years younger.</sentence><sentence id="284">The next neighbor next door was also very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="285">They -- they had a --a girl who was my age as well.</sentence><sentence id="286">And the three girls and myself, we were almost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10.</sentence><sentence id="287">And again, there was very little, to me, was very little awareness of -- of what's the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: So you're saying you didn't experience any anti-Semitic remarks at that time, during that interval?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: I--I wouldn't say that.</sentence><sentence id="313">What I was saying is that I did have non-Jewish friends.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="314">We had a number of anti-Semites in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">And there was one incident which I remember very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="316">There was a teacher, who was a -- quite an anti-Semite and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="319">8 November 13, 1997 he disliked me and I disliked him also, and once he asked me something, and I sort of a smart-alecky answer and he gave me a big slap on the face.</sentence><sentence id="320">And I -- that was the first time I have ever ha-had -- even my parents didn't do things like that to me, and I was very upset.</sentence><sentence id="321">And the interesting end of this story was that a couple of years -- couple of days later, this fellow came over and apologized to me that he did this, that he shouldn't have.</sentence><sentence id="322">But I know that his feelings were not very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="323">But he --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Do you think that's because you were Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Lam almost positive that that was the case, that because I was Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: How do you know that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: Well, I think he was a member of some sort of a Hungarian Nazi party.</sentence><sentence id="330">And he was certainly -- he was the warden, the air raid warden there, and he was very gung- ho on -- on the war.</sentence><sentence id="331">This was the first year of the war, when this whole thing happened, in 1941, and I know that he was -- he was nationalist at least.</sentence><sentence id="332">But 1-I--I always had the feeling that he was also an anti-Semite.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: What was it like for you as a young child to have your father tell you that he lost his job, his work, because he was Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="338">Do you remember what your reaction was at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Well, I[--I don't -- I don't remember what my reaction was, but I remember when he lost his job.</sentence><sentence id="342">I do not recall whether it was a panic time or not.</sentence><sentence id="343">But he has</sentence><sentence id="345">lost his job many times during the -- the depression, and he always found something to do, and somehow to make a living.</sentence><sentence id="346">He was a man who could make a living on a -- in <span class="REGION">Antarctica</span> probably as well.</sentence><sentence id="347">He was a very ingenious person.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: So you don't remember feeling particularly threatened in 1939 because you were Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>

happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed.</sentence><sentence id="1657">We thought that the doctor did -- betrayed us, it was not the doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1658">It was aman by name of

all got fried and then we ate a piece of it.</sentence><sentence id="1886">That was the food for that particular day.</sentence><sentence id="1887">People were not very choosy at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1888">My father also went around to see what -- what was the situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1889">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was -- th-the <span class="REGION">area</span> originally was an <span class="REGION">area</span> for about 12,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="1890">By the

the food to her son, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn't know, and her own son, and there was really no choice in the matter.</sentence><sentence id="2286">She felt still guilty til the

we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="2300">We went back, it took us three hours, two and a half miles.</sentence><sentence id="2301">We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many dead horses, and one live Russian.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Which was almost ludicrous because this man</sentence><sentence id="2304">.deg November 13, 1997 was singing.</sentence><sentence id="2305">He was singing, he wa -- must have been drunk, but he -- he had a happy face, he was smiling and singing.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And we looked at him as

id="2308">And as we were walking, these shrapnels were hitting <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, and whole <span class="DLF">walls</span> came down, tumbling in front of us.</sentence><sentence id="2309">I mean, we were in mortal danger, we -- we were crazy to walk there, but we did.</sentence><sentence id="2310">And we walked through the <span class="DLF">city park</span>, and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2311">I mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2312">My father couldn't lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2313">That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month.</sentence><sentence id="2314">It was -- was a square loaf of bread, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2315">And they just let us go.</sentence><sentence id="2316">And we stumbled <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got there.</sentence><sentence id="2317">And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2318">Mr. Dudek(ph) was the man who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for years, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June, and which he gave back to us.</sentence><sentence id="2319">I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">suitcase</span> was a green suitcase, it was a canvas, but it was full of canned food.</sentence><sentence id="2320">He didn't take any.</sentence><sentence id="2321">But the rest of the people who lived there were rather frightened.</sentence><sentence id="2322">They looked at us as if we were ghosts.</sentence><sentence id="2323">Not</sentence><sentence id="2325">ia November 13, 1997 just because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious.</sentence><sentence id="2326">Here these Jews came back.</sentence><sentence id="2327">Now what will happen?</sentence><sentence id="2328">There were -- we knew about those extreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was -- who was boasting about his adventures with the Hassidic Jews whose -- whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled with -- with pork.</sentence><sentence id="2329">And some others, who were no less guilty.</sentence><sentence id="2330">They thought they will -- that we were going to denounce them to the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2331">We were too tired, too sick to -- too nothing to -- to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2332">The miracle which happened to us was that a few hours later my

longer there.</sentence><sentence id="2967">So -- but -- but we still had some spark, and -- and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are Jewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me.</sentence><sentence id="2968">And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2969">We knew that there were a few people who -- who we could not, including teachers.</sentence><sentence id="2970">And this came to a head in 1950.</sentence><sentence id="2971">In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, demanding of the government of nationalizing our <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2972">And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers.</sentence><sentence id="2973">And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te -- a teacher-student-parent conference.</sentence><sentence id="2974">And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that -- the principal of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2975">And this --all <span class="NPIP">hell</span> broke loose.</sentence><sentence id="2976">And I was there and I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2977">There was a parent of a classmate of mine whose -- who told the students and the teacher, who did not want</sentence><sentence id="2979">to identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are traitors.</sentence><sentence id="2980">And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2981">And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next school year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was -- who -- whom we found out was a-- was a defector.</sentence><sentence id="2982">And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students.</sentence><sentence id="2983">But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed.</sentence><sentence id="2984">Our class of 30 became a class of 13.</sentence><sentence id="2985">This was our sixth grade, it was <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2986">And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less.</sentence><sentence id="2987">We couldn't talk about Jewish history.</sentence><sentence id="2988">We couldn't talk about Jewish things.</sentence><sentence id="2989">But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2990">And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example.</sentence><sentence id="2991">An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the head.</sentence><sentence id="2992">I mean, he was always a--a lesson ahead of us, but that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2993">And -- and we took this as a joke, <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2994">But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> for us, is going to come to an end.</sentence><sentence id="2995">And then what?</sentence><sentence id="2996">And that end came in 1952, when I graduated.</sentence><sentence id="2997">Now one of the motivations of the -- all of my classmates who left, was that nobody's going to be accepted in a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> from a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> such as the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2998">That was the motivation why they left.</sentence><sentence id="2999">It turned out very ironically, that out of the two -- four -- 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were</sentence><sentence id="3001">100 November 13, 1997 accepted.</sentence><sentence id="3002">Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom.</sentence><sentence id="3003">Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise.</sentence><sentence id="3004">The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn't even want to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3005">I was accepted.</sentence><sentence id="3006">And here came the big shock.</sentence><sentence id="3007">The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">technical university</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200.</sentence><sentence id="3008">And we had this huge <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and we were sitting there, you know, men and women.</sentence><sentence id="3009">And I found myself in -- very much in a minority.</sentence><sentence id="3010">This was the year where it made a difference who's -- who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications.</sentence><sentence id="3011">If your parents were businessmen, you wat -- you were rejected.</sentence><sentence id="3012">My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a -- what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure.</sentence><sentence id="3013">My father wasn't a businessman by then, he worked for another <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3014">And so in -- I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me.</sentence><sentence id="3015">The chemistry worked there.</sentence><sentence id="3016">Very quickly we found from each other -- 0-of each other, who were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3017">Of the f-- of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn't know from Adam.</sentence><sentence id="3019">We found us, each other and we drifted toward each other.</sentence><sentence id="3020">The way the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were -- was</sentence><sentence id="3022">aa November 13, 1997 divided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering -- this was only mechanical engineering.</sentence><sentence id="3023">We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding, whatever else.</sentence><sentence id="3024">And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy -- naval architecture, we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not.</sentence><sentence id="3025">And we were sort of drifting in and out.</sentence><sentence id="3026">I was -- I was never really very friendly with these people because their culture, their -- their interests were very different from me.</sentence><sentence id="3027">I felt sorry for them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with the material.</sentence><sentence id="3028">They didn't know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3029">I have to step back now because there is a -- an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally.</sentence><sentence id="3030">And that -- what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old.</sentence><sentence id="3031">This was right before graduation in February of 1952.</sentence><sentence id="3032">Fell in love with a young girl who didn't understand my -- my feelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated.</sentence><sentence id="3033">And I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick.</sentence><sentence id="3034">They thought I had mononucleosis and other diseases and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a month.</sentence><sentence id="3035">And this was in February - March of "52, just before graduation.</sentence><sentence id="3036">And my wa -- mother and father were worried that I was going to se -- lose that year.</sentence><sentence id="3037">But my colleagues were very nice and they brought me up to date very f-- very fast.</sentence><sentence id="3038">Then April roll -- rolled along, and walking</sentence><sentence id="3040">102 November 13, 1997 on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar.</sentence><sentence id="3041">Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3042">Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3043">She became a singer, she never married.</sentence><sentence id="3044">Didn't marry the -- broke off with the fiance, and she was single.</sentence><sentence id="3045">I was 18, she was 22 - 23.</sentence><sentence id="3046">And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before.</sentence><sentence id="3047">It became a very hot romance, not to my mother's liking and my father's liking, who felt that I should really learn and study.</sentence><sentence id="3048">The way it went in our school system is that we finished the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam.</sentence><sentence id="3049">And it was almost like a PhD thing.</sentence><sentence id="3050">And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral.</sentence><sentence id="3051">And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions.</sentence><sentence id="3052">We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers.</sentence><sentence id="3053">Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can't learn eight years of answers in two months.</sentence><sentence id="3054">You really had to learn some other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3055">But at that point, you know, the -- the summer was full blown and -- and I was too interested in -- in -- in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study.</sentence><sentence id="3056">But I studied a little.</sentence><sentence id="3057">And -- and it was just the hottest romance we had.</sentence><sentence id="3058">It was sort of crazy.</sentence><sentence id="3059">The -- her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were vacant during the day and we</sentence><sentence id="3061">103 November 13, 1997 took advantage of it.</sentence><sentence id="3062">And it was my real -- first real romance.</sentence><sentence id="3063">I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes.</sentence><sentence id="3064">This was really a woman.</sentence><sentence id="3065">| didn't know what -- and she didn't know how to handle it either.</sentence><sentence id="3066">Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18.</sentence><sentence id="3067">If I didn't know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she -- she should have known better.</sentence><sentence id="3068">Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn't see eye to eye through this.</sentence><sentence id="3069">I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation.</sentence><sentence id="3070">My fa-- my mother told me the same.</sentence><sentence id="3071">My father said absolutely not, I am -- you are a minor.</sentence><sentence id="3072">In --in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> you were a minor until 21, and I'm not giving your permission and that's that.</sentence><sentence id="3073">Make the long story short, we didn't marry and she had an abortion.</sentence><sentence id="3074">And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact.</sentence><sentence id="3075">And saying that, you know, she understands the -- the pain and the sorrow.</sentence><sentence id="3076">But she has to understand that I am too young and | am just starting my -- my schooling, and she should have known better.</sentence><sentence id="3077">And that romance stayed with me for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="3078">That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it.</sentence><sentence id="3079">It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children.</sentence><sentence id="3080">Nothing bad happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="3081">But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3082">And I went on to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I had this -- and I had another girlfriend about a</sentence><sentence id="3084">104 November 13, 1997 year later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was.</sentence><sentence id="3085">And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to "56.</sentence><sentence id="3086">I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name.</sentence><sentence id="3087">And we had a tempestuous relationship.</sentence><sentence id="3088">But there was a -- there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of -- small circle of friends.</sentence><sentence id="3089">We still kept going to -- to -- to <span class="BUILDING">operas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3090">We went to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3091">We kept a cultural core, which the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in itself did not, you know, they -- they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide.</sentence><sentence id="3092">But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a-- in a great degree.</sentence><sentence id="3093">Between 1952 and deg56, times were hard, and I was working very hard in -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, trying to earn my college tuition, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="3094">We were not rich, and I really needed to work.</sentence><sentence id="3095">In the summertime, I did.</sentence><sentence id="3096">I went to -- this was not my choice, I had to do work once -- one month every summer, work -- we got paid -- in industry.</sentence><sentence id="3097">And one month every summer, we had to go to the -- to the army.</sentence><sentence id="3098">And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you.</sentence><sentence id="3099">Both -- I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="3100">And that in is -- in itself a story of itself, but I'm not going to go in there.</sentence><sentence id="3101">Fifty-six came around.</sentence><sentence id="3102">The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck.</sentence><sentence id="3103">My father all of a sudden got sick and died.</sentence><sentence id="3104">He got celebra -- cerebral hemorrhage.</sentence><sentence id="3105">He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him.</sentence><sentence id="3106">This was at the end of March, right</sentence><sentence id="3108">105 November 13, 1997 during my period of exams, final exams.</sentence><sentence id="3109">And I was very scared, and I didn't know how to handle it.</sentence><sentence id="3110">I was 22.</sentence><sentence id="3111">I had a ver -- a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud -- he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a -- an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought.</sentence><sentence id="3112">He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well.</sentence><sentence id="3113">He was a very, very close friend.</sentence><sentence id="3114">He sort of said look, I think you should pull together.</sentence><sentence id="3115">You should have a better -- a bigger family.</sentence><sentence id="3116">You should really be not one -- I mean you -- my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died.</sentence><sentence id="3117">In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father.</sentence><sentence id="3118">And I drifted -- the only person I had close was my mother.</sentence><sentence id="3119">I had a couple of cousins I wasn't that friendly with.</sentence><sentence id="3120">My maternal grandmother died.</sentence><sentence id="3121">My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="3122">I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them.</sentence><sentence id="3123">So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to.</sentence><sentence id="3124">And I was scared, so Erica's family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica.</sentence><sentence id="3125">And -- and essentially I felt that maybe this is the time when -- when I should have my own, and then I engaged -- I became engaged to her.</sentence><sentence id="3126">And we had an engagement in August.</sentence><sentence id="3127">And we were planning to get married after I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was at the fall of 1956.</sentence><sentence id="3128">It was going to</sentence><sentence id="3130">106 November 13, 1997 be

id="3133">of October became a notable day, but for me the 224 was the -- the real clincher.</sentence><sentence id="3134">There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o'clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> must be an independent state and should declare neutrally -- neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out.</sentence><sentence id="3135">And we agreed that on the 23" in the morning, we would all come back to the <span

and then the shooting war started.</sentence><sentence id="3138">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> about a week later, and I participated in some of the -- the skirmishes

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3472">A: Probably.</sentence><sentence id="3473">I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="3474">At that point I was only thinking about the now and the

were removed a few months before, and we have no other <span class="DLF">barrier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3479">And this was the chance.</sentence><sentence id="3480">And I think there are some

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3542">A: I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="3543">The day before we left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, we decided my -- my fiancee and

long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> was very different, I am sure, than what it is now.</sentence><sentence id="3547">It was much closer to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had --

class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, my mother and I, and my fiancee's parents were in daily telephone contact.</sentence><sentence id="3557">The original plan was that her -- her parents and my mother would essentially come to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then we would meet there.</sentence><sentence id="3558">The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to -- to <span

didn't want to take the chance.</sentence><sentence id="3560">It started to be fairly late in December.</sentence><sentence id="3561">My mother and a cousin of mine went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.253694" long="20.146056">Szeged</span>, which is close to the <span class="DLF">Yugoslavian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3562">They tried it there, they

long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and see what happens and leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> legally.</sentence><sentence id="3564">I didn't want to wait for her because by then we had the

down.</sentence><sentence id="3566">On the 20", I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don't need those Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3567">You come with me, I

it's</sentence><sentence id="3572">115 November 13, 1997 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, it's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian town</span>, sort of.</sentence><sentence id="3573">Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3574">Now my uncle is a fisi-- was a physician.</sentence><sentence id="3575">I didn't know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret.</sentence><sentence id="3576">This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me.</sentence><sentence id="3577">Until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, I went to say Kaddish for my father every day.</sentence><sentence id="3578">When I came to this <span

id="3581">She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job.</sentence><sentence id="3582">I got a general helper's job in a small <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have.</sentence><sentence id="3583">What -- and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things is that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fiancee and I had decided to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which had a little, small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3584">And we -- to say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaddish</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3585">So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle's whom we -- knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3586">And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fiancee in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3587">You know, ho -- what -- what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="3588">Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that -- why didn't I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him.</sentence><sentence id="3589">So it</sentence><sentence id="3591">mn November 13, 1997 was a big fallout.</sentence><sentence id="3592">I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address.</sentence><sentence id="3593">And it -- the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e -- much glee Iam sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I will -- and I am just a terrible person.</sentence><sentence id="3595">My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="3596">Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was -- "57 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left.</sentence><sentence id="3597">My fiancee stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="3598">I went to vi-- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, I stayed there for over a year.</sentence><sentence id="3599">My fiancee and I sort of broke up at this point.</sentence><sentence id="3600">She moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and later on she got married.</sentence><sentence id="3601">My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in August of 1957, with a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3602">She never went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, she stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3603">My uncle, who was her brother, helped him -- her a bit, however, in reality what he did is he told me that I have to help my mother.</sentence><sentence id="3604">And I sent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="3605">After <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>, I got a job as an engi -- junior engineer at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westinghouse</span>, and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drexel</span> and</sentence><sentence id="3607">m November 13, 1997 I started to study engineering.</sentence><sentence id="3608">And I did that until March of "58, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and she will be coming in the next six months.</sentence><sentence id="3609">And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or help her when she's here.</sentence><sentence id="3610">So I had no choice in the matter, I quit <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3611">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3612">I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it -- my friend's help, I got a job.</sentence><sentence id="3613">And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3614">This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph).</sentence><sentence id="3615">Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil -- she liked me.</sentence><sentence id="3616">And she called Cardinal O'Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of

there.</sentence><sentence id="3618">I also enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> there, I stayed there for seven years.</sentence><sentence id="3619">I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi -- ending up as an as- assistant professor and receiving my Master's degree in mechanical engineering in 1962.</sentence><sentence id="3620">In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer.</sentence><sentence id="3621">That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later.</sentence><sentence id="3622">Two months after I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in 58, my mother arrived here.</sentence><sentence id="3623">And I live with my mother from "58 until 64.</sentence><sentence id="3624">And I worked in the

found a little job to get a social security, finally.</sentence><sentence id="3628">And the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> experience was -- was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it -- it's a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3629">At that time <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> was a rather backwards <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in terms of theology.</sentence><sentence id="3630">They still didn't step out to the 15" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn't tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that's not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left.</sentence><sentence id="3631">Well, actually, divorce wasn't as bad as my remarriage in 1964.</sentence><sentence id="3632">I met another Jewish girl here, and we married.</sentence><sentence id="3633">And that -- after that, things became very intolerable.</sentence><sentence id="3634">By then I only worked part-time at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3635">I got a job in a research inst -- a research in -- firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="3636">One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, is I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since "56, and the first time I really had a chance to travel.</sentence><sentence id="3637">And it was a fabulous two months of -- of -- of not just vacationing, but -- but discovering <span class="REGION">western Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3638">It was very interesting, because I sailed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, which was called the USS France.</sentence><sentence id="3639">On the manifesto of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph).</sentence><sentence id="3640">She became my wife a year later.</sentence><sentence id="3641">We didn't know that we were sailing on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, or if we were traveling together.</sentence><sentence id="3642">We met in a</sentence><sentence id="3644">-- ina Jewish get together, about a half a year later.</sentence><sentence id="3645">In 1966, I went to join the -- work for the navy.</sentence><sentence id="3646">At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis.</sentence><sentence id="3647">And the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had no <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> which was really capable of doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="3648">So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did.</sentence><sentence id="3649">I worked there 11 years.</sentence><sentence id="3650">I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis.</sentence><sentence id="3651">I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn't -- I was in -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it.</sentence><sentence id="3652">And I really didn't think that I needed it.</sentence><sentence id="3653">So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I -- the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3654">It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research.</sentence><sentence id="3655">I wrote more than 50 papers.</sentence><sentence id="3656">I was involved in the professional development there.</sentence><sentence id="3657">And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="3658">I moved from 19 -- from <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> where | lived, to <span

mutual consent got divorced.</sentence><sentence id="3661">Reason why we did -- and this was a -- again a fairly long story, is I had a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children.</sentence><sentence id="3662">We went through three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her</sentence><sentence id="3664">m November 13, 1997 biological clock was

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3997">Q: Why do you think it's relevant?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3999">A: Why is it relevant?</sentence><sentence id="4000">I think that it's relevant because people are -- most people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what happens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as they were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message is still fresh.</sentence><sentence id="4001">You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is the only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides.</sentence></p></dialogue>

different from the story of the Polish Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it -- in my estimation it's underrepresented in the -- in the main exhibit, anyway.</sentence><sentence id="4198">So it should -- it should find someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="4199">The French Jews same thing, and -- and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are also underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4203">134 November 13, 1997</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4204">Q:

id="4207">I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak to them, in a Belfer conference.</sentence><sentence id="4208">I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave, who recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers" education.</sentence><sentence id="4209">After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse -- to -- must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a -- the education department recognized the contribution with the educ -- which the survivors could make to education.</sentence><sentence id="4210">But I had some memorable instances this year, when I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting around and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and wanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them.</sentence><sentence id="4211">And one -- and telling me -- and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but other years, is that their me -- most meaningful experience was to meet survivors.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4212">That many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to person touch was -- was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit to their students.</sentence><sentence id="4213">And I really believe that.</sentence><sentence id="4214">That was certainly most memorable for me there.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4218">135 November 13, 1997</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4219">Q: Are there any particular parts of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> with which you identify with?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4220">Anything special there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4221">A: Of course, I-- I under -- I identify with everything.</sentence><sentence id="4222">It would be saying, you know, if you have many children, who do you love more?</sentence><sentence id="4223">But despite of that, there are certain things obviously, which -- which were closer -- or which are closer to me than other <span class="NPIP">pieces</span> are.</sentence><sentence id="4224">For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="4225">Obviously, the man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate family's life, makes a difference to me.</sentence><sentence id="4226">But -- but everything is meaningful.</sentence><sentence id="4227">And of course th-the-the large pictures which -- which show the Hungarian Jews on the ramp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered faces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old.</sentence><sentence id="4228">I have a picture of it, and I provided that to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> to show that this was a uniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore.</sentence><sentence id="4229">And so Iam always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of them.</sentence><sentence id="4230">They of course, not survived and I did.</sentence><sentence id="4231">And that is a very emotional thing, but for me -- and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and -- and go through that -- that exhibit so many times, isn't that stressful?</sentence><sentence id="4232">The answer is, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="4233">It's a gut-wrenching experience, and I -- I feel that I owe that to -- to the</sentence><sentence id="4235">136 November 13, 1997 dead, and I owe that to myself and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate, of what it was, not just to look from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in, but what it was to be in, in <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4251">Q: Be-Because of the very difficult experiences you had during the war, was there ever a time when you resisted remembering what you experienced?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4253">A: I--I do not remember consciously resisting.</sentence><sentence id="4254">After the war, particularly after the communists took over in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, this was a taboo subject.</sentence><sentence id="4255">We did not focus at this, we had day -- daily problems and concerns.</sentence><sentence id="4256">The memory, as fresh as it is 53 years later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its vividity, its -- its vividness, its -- its -- its relevance.</sentence><sentence id="4257">And it stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="4258">I mean, it obviously this kind of things don't go away forever, but I never resisted it consciously, I si--I simply just went somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="4259">I -- I did -- and I -- I must say also that my life is not defined by the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4260">Maybe in the later, last few years it's focusing -- the Holocaust is more of a focus.</sentence><sentence id="4261">But as you heard it from my post- Holocaust experiences and my -- my professional life, I was not -- the fofo -- the Holocaust did not deter me in what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="4262">I was among the probably few who ended up not in a helping profession.</sentence><sentence id="4263">You would be a-amazed how many of the survivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha -- how many ended up in becoming a -- more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers.</sentence><sentence id="4264">But I was among the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and</sentence><sentence id="4266">137 November 13, 1997 profession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I am very much like -- I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4267">I still do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only.</sentence><sentence id="4268">But I f-- want to use my survivor status to speak, and my -- my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long as I can.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4288">A: Lam sure I would be.</sentence><sentence id="4289">I think the wartime experiences has -- had taught me a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="4290">Many things which I probably wouldn't be.</sentence><sentence id="4291">Persistence.</sentence><sentence id="4292">Not be cowed by -- by intimidations.</sentence><sentence id="4293">Sometimes recognize when a crucial decision have to be made, and I learned that heroes are not born, but made.</sentence><sentence id="4294">Not un -- I'm not com -- saying that I'm a hero, but at least I have seen heroes who became heroes, who were plain folk, and -- and I brushed with death very many times.</sentence><sentence id="4295">So many times that sometimes I worry that I run out of luck eventually.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4306">A: [have to tell you the -- I have to tell you a little story about this.</sentence><sentence id="4307">You know Einstein was asked the same question.</sentence><sentence id="4308">The -- does he feel American, German or Jewish, and he says -- do you know what his answer was?</sentence><sentence id="4309">His answer was, well, as long as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I'm German, the</sentence><sentence id="4311">138 November 13, 1997 Americans will say I-- I am American, and of course the Jews will say I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4312">But if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I'm German and the Germans will say I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4313">So the same way with me, it's -- I feel that the components are there.</sentence><sentence id="4314">I am a part --I have 22 years of me with Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="4315">I have 40 years of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they somehow counteract and interact.</sentence><sentence id="4316">I -- I think it is -- is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component.</sentence><sentence id="4317">I -- I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music.</sentence><sentence id="4318">I love American literature, but I love a lot of -- lot of other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4319">And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4320">But I lo -- but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither.</sentence><sentence id="4321">For example, I -- I love photography, which is neither Jewish -- although there were many Jewish photographers.</sentence><sentence id="4322">Neither Jewish nor Hungarian were -- there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers.</sentence><sentence id="4323">Nor American, where again, same -- same thing happens.</sentence><sentence id="4324">My interest and philosophy of life, I hope transcends somehow, this compartmentalization.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4347">A: Yeah, I 1-1 like to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and I like to go back to a--a concern I--T had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers"</sentence><sentence id="4349">139 November 13, 1997 education.</sentence><sentence id="4350">I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian.</sentence><sentence id="4351">I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> about anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="4352">And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was -- where I am -- was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central -- centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4353">And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea.</sentence><sentence id="4354">And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa -- one of the -- one of the teachers said well, what happens if e -- we teach it different?</sentence><sentence id="4355">And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way.</sentence><sentence id="4356">Well, that's nice.</sentence><sentence id="4357">I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec -- spe-specific and fairly practical objections.</sentence><sentence id="4358">For example one black teacher got up -- very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> from the <span class="REGION">Bible Belt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4359">I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt -- their -- their New Testament is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4360">I can't teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4361">How do I do this?</sentence><sentence id="4362">And I was really concerned and I am -- I think that this is a great central concern and should be of the education department to -- to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a -- of -- of the anti-Semitism in such a way that</sentence><sentence id="4364">140 November 13, 1997 the teachers can accept it.</sentence><sentence id="4365">I'm not talking sugarcoating.</sentence><sentence id="4366">I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it.</sentence><sentence id="4367">If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won't be taught.</sentence><sentence id="4368">And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost.</sentence><sentence id="4369">It's not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened.</sentence><sentence id="4370">And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art -- of anti- Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="4371">But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves?</sentence><sentence id="4372">I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling.</sentence><sentence id="4373">I mean, they -- they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don't know how to resolve it.</sentence><sentence id="4374">I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and that's not a small amount of work either.</sentence><sentence id="4375">That's my parting shot for this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
