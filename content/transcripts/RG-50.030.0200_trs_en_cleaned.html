<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And could you tell me a little bit about your parents and their occupations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Uh my father was a small-town lawyer in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="16">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitchen</span> (ph), which a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of a county seat called ,uh in German, and uh my mother was from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> and when the time came for me to be born, she decided to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to mother where her parents lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> and uh where the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> were better, so I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> but I lived there for only seven days of my life, and then they brought me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I grew up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">Uh my family consisted of my parents and an older brother, brother who was six years older and it was a as | remember it a nice life really for for us.</sentence><sentence id="18">While we were not very rich.</sentence><sentence id="19">They were kind of a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to grow up in uh as a youngster with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and swimming and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: When you were growing up, was was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh mostly a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> or a non-Jewish town?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, it was a...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a typical eastern European or Polish ..uh I'm talking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> in which I lived, and it may...1 1 1 suppose it had maybe five thousand people of...and of the five thousand, maybe two thousand or two and a half thousand were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="28">Uh our family was relatively assimilated so I had both Jewish and non- Jewish friends.</sentence><sentence id="29">I spoke only Polish and not Yiddish so that uh immediately uh limited my association with uh youngsters from <span class="BUILDING">religious Jewish homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">And I I considered myself Polish as well as Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="31">Of course that view of myself uh changed very quickly once the war came, because my Christian friends reminded me very soon that I was not one of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: What uh...from the time the war began, what...how did your life change before you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, after the Germans came?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Uh the war as you know started in September, September Ist, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="40">I was eleven, eleven and a half years old and when the war started I remember uh as it was starting I remember the excitement of...excitement on the part of an eleven year old of seeing our parents uh you know getting ready and listen to the radio, listen to the news and there was something about uh I suppose exciting about it.</sentence><sentence id="41">Then the war started.</sentence><sentence id="42">My father who was a a reserve officer in the Polish army expected to be mobilized but before anything happened uh the Germans came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and to the best of my recollection it was on the 8th of September, about a week or eight days after the war started, and uh things have changed from then on.</sentence><sentence id="43">First uh the day after the Germans came or maybe two days after, they uh broke into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh and uh burned the Torahs (ph) and destroyed uh the the the contents and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and they imposed restrictions on the general population, but more severe restrictions on the Jews, arrested a number of uh intellectuals or people that they considered to be uh leaders of society.</sentence><sentence id="44">Among them was my father who was arrested by the Gestapo about a week or maybe two weeks after the Germans arrived and and uh the life was changed.</sentence><sentence id="45">It was getting progressively worse.</sentence><sentence id="46">The restrictions were...that were imposed on us were were by themselves small but progressively more severe and the penalties were very, very severe, so therefore, for example, one was prohibited from shopping in certain <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> or later prohibited from uh being walking on certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> or later required to wear a white arm band with a blue Star of David on it, or prohibited from using the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">While each restriction by by by itself was not all that severe, the penalty was very frequently imprisonment or execution and consequently life was changed.</sentence><sentence id="48">And as as time passed, uh life became more and more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="49">In addition to it, there were Jews, and my parents in particular were unable to exercise uh their professions or make a living and we had to sustain ourselves by slowly selling whatever possessions we had...furniture, fur coats, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>...and so the life was difficult and uh and in addition to it, my my friends, my former associates who were Christians uh now were quite uh sensitive to the fact that I was not one of them and made me and let me know about it.</sentence><sentence id="50">I remember the day when the when our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed and when the Germans pulled out the torahs on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and burned it...uh we youngsters were observing this and wanted to know what the Germans were doing.</sentence><sentence id="51">My Christian friends stayed and laughed and said that that's kind of a funny uh incident where I and maybe one or two other Jews who were there felt aa sense of damage or destruction, and kind of laughed, you know, destroyed and so things like this have happened.</sentence><sentence id="52">So my life has changed both because there were restrictions on the Jews, because there was uh economic hardship, and because there was a general rejection by those of my friends whom I with whom I associated prior to the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Now you then went into a a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">Is that correct?</sentence><sentence id="69">Can you tell me about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="74">I...let me just add something else.</sentence><sentence id="75">There is one something else that happened of course.</sentence><sentence id="76">Uh the the war started in September of 1939 and and shortly we were occupied uh mid-September or late September, the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> opened again.</sentence><sentence id="77"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> in Europe started usually the first Monday in September, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was...I think was in the fifth grade at that time and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was time to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">And I remember my teacher who who was known as anti-Semitic, my Polish Christian teacher, uh taking me aside with some sense of embarrassment and telling me that Jews were no longer allowed to attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so there was another change.</sentence><sentence id="79">That was another another restriction on my life.</sentence><sentence id="80">To to go back to your question, yes, uh life was getting more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="81">There more and more restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="82">My father, after a number of months of uh being imprisoned, was uh released, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a broken, sick man and uh the restrictions that the Germans imposed upon us were greater and greater.</sentence><sentence id="83">There was some terror.</sentence><sentence id="84">There was some executions.</sentence><sentence id="85">We were basically uh we were basically conditioned to to to obey the laws and the restrictions, the demands, until early in 1942 uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established in in and uh slowly the various uh Jewish communities both in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were compelled to leave all possessions behind and move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so in the spring of 1942 my family uh was required to move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the oldest part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">It was very congested.</sentence><sentence id="87">There was lots of misery and hunger and uh uh sickness and it was really as terrible as one can imagine life to be.</sentence><sentence id="88">I was at that time fourteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="89">Let me talk to you a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if that's OK.</sentence><sentence id="90">There were always I would guess maybe fifteen to twenty thousand Jewish people in this very small section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, uh small section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">It was surrounded by a very tall <span class="DLF">wooden fence</span> which was guarded continuously by both German and Polish police.</sentence><sentence id="92">Food was very limited and there was really no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="93">We managed to to share a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a with one of my father's brothers who was also an attorney and people were living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and it was just terrible and in those circumstances the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was full of rumors or speculations.</sentence><sentence id="94">Uh people were speculating that something is going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="95">There were rumors that people who are not working will go to work, uh will be compelled to to go to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> outside of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to to work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">There was other speculation that people will be sent here and there.</sentence><sentence id="97">It was a fearful, terrible time which was made worse by a growing terror on the part of the Germans who would come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at night and execute people at random, just kind of break into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh into an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, enter an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and take out the two women or a man and his son and execute them, and then uh leave that <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and go to another one.</sentence><sentence id="98">If something in in their pattern that appeared completely random and execute some other people for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="99">It did condition us, however, to be really fearful and terrorized and made us realize that uh we have virtually no choices, because the community, the the Christian community, the Polish community outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not supportive or sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="100">If anything they they be...they were active in in uh spotting and denouncing Jews who left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when a penalty for doing it was execution and as the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were getting worse and worse uh people thought about doing something else, but there were virtually no choices.</sentence><sentence id="101">One either had to stay and hope for the best or take a chance and jump over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and that was not an easy thing to do because uh unlike soldiers who really are responsible for themselves, most people had children or wives or parents and and one who was maybe willing to be courageous and put one's own life at risk, but few people are willing to do that to their own family, so that was the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">Hunger, misery, terror, execution.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Did you have any particular daily activity?</sentence><sentence id="134">Did you try to continue your studies or anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="138">There was there was no opportunity to study.</sentence><sentence id="139">Some people of course in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> worked.</sentence><sentence id="140">Uh my father found a some job in some social organization which really I I think had no other value than he gave him a a a some certificate that uh that that allowed him to be excused in any kind of a a raid for for workers to work on the on railroad and so on, but there was no education.</sentence><sentence id="141">There was no...nothing formal.</sentence><sentence id="142">Uh of course our Jewish and intellectual roots uh cause us caused us to continue doing it, so there was some private private teaching and former <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students who were maybe teenagers were uh busy teaching reading and writing to youngsters and I who was fourteen was also sometimes asked to teach young children of nine or six to how to read and write, so there was a little bit of act...there was some, there was some, there was a structure to deal with it but nothing formal.</sentence><sentence id="143">Much of the time was spent uh wandering through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> looking for some opportunity to to do something that would secure some food or listening to rumors or just wasting time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did any kind of an underground organization develop?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: There was uh...first of all, you have to understand that as a as a fourteen year old, I wasn't necessarily trusted enough to to be taken into it.</sentence><sentence id="154">Uh I don't know that there was a underground organization that uh that had plans to enter into combat, but there was, there were many underground organizations that dealt with the cultural and social life of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and uh uh approved and...I shouldn't say approved...but uh supported activities that were really prohibited by by the Germans like teaching or having some religious services or having some social services that provided whatever little help one could provide to to the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">It was underground.</sentence><sentence id="156">It took courage.</sentence><sentence id="157">It took commitment, even though it did not involve carrying a gun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about six months, and...uh in in about June of 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was fully of rumors.</sentence><sentence id="166">Rife was rumors that something is going to happen and uh it gave it it caused us all to be very active, to run from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> to to listen for some rumors, and I remember being one day uh together with my brother who was uh twenty at that time...I was fourteen...in front of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the <span class="BUILDING">German work office</span>, <span class="BUILDING">labor office</span> uh and people...whatever there were there...maybe two or three hundred people standing and milling around.</sentence><sentence id="167">There was fear in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">There was concern and at some point some of the officials of the the German officials came out and started examining identity papers of those people that were ed...on the edge of the crowd and again people were saying (cough) oh this is good or bad and those whose papers will be somehow examined will be sent out to work and others were saying those that whose papers are examined will be allowed to stay here, and it (cough)...excuse me...and in in the course of that uh activity and that...all that was accompanied you must understand while beating and kicking and hitting...and they looked at the young man's paper, a man, a young man who was maybe sixteen or seventeen at that time...I I knew him...and uh his papers, his identity card which was yellow...that was specifically uh given to Jews...uh yellow because the Germans consider yellow to be a color of shame and they were very very much involved with the symbolism of that...and his papers indicated that he had some physical limitation that uh excused him from random assignment to la...to to work groups, and one of the Germans looked at these papers and said, ah...in German of course...you didn't want to work before so the heck with you now.</sentence><sentence id="169">And that gave us, of course, all of us, a great crowd of a few hundred people an indication that having the paper somehow stamped, the process was a positive thing.</sentence><sentence id="170">Everybody started pushing forward with their papers in hand and the Germans, the...additional German officials came out and was shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and beating and pushing people back, and it it happened that the man in charge of that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was a a man of German origin who lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> before the war and was a teacher, a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teacher, my brother's high school teacher.</sentence><sentence id="171">He recognized my brother and said to him, give me your paper and of course my brother also gave him mine.</sentence><sentence id="172">Our papers were taken away and we went...our papers and the papers of a number of other people, and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without them.</sentence><sentence id="173">Again, the rumors were they are not letting us know what what this is all about and the next morning the Jewish police...they were kind of Jewish police is really...that's what they were called but they more like like couriers and and and uh people who help keep order...anyway a Jewish policeman came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and returned mine and my brother's paper and they had a stamp put from the German Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="174">We didn't know what it meant.</sentence><sentence id="175">We, again, were driven by rumors and speculation.</sentence><sentence id="176">Uh two days later there was an announcement in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">This is now late June of 1942...I have to take some water...(pause)...announcements posted on all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in Polish and in German and in Yiddish I believe, basically saying that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is being being evacuated, being moved or the inhabitants are being moved to a big <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">Let me just point out that this was in June of "42.</sentence><sentence id="179">Uh the German-Russian war started in June of "41 and June of "42 was the height of German success in in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> where the large segments of Russian were under German occupation, so it made sense when they said that the ghetto population is being moved to a large <span class="DLF">communal farm</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> that sits idle.</sentence><sentence id="180">There will be work there, that the trip will take uh three days and that people should take food along for three days which really silly because we had no food, and that uh what the climate is going to be and uh what clothing to take along and that everyone except those who have stamps on their ID cards, on their identification papers, are required to to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="181">Deported is not the term they used, but to be moved to that new new <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">I didn't want to stay.</sentence><sentence id="183">I was fourteen.</sentence><sentence id="184">I was the youngest son.</sentence><sentence id="185">I wanted to go with my parents, but my parents said no, uh stay here.</sentence><sentence id="186">You have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">You'll be with your brother.</sentence><sentence id="188">We don't know what's going to happen over there.</sentence><sentence id="189">In retrospect, I don't know...they they had some premonition that that story was really a lie as as you can gather.</sentence><sentence id="190">Anyway uh a week later the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was divided into two parts.</sentence><sentence id="191">The lar...it was the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">It was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> but we call...they called it the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">One corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was uh surrounded by an <span class="DLF">internal fence</span> and the instructions were given by the Germans that all those who had their cards stamped including their wives and children had to move to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and no one in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...no one can be in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without a stamp on his card and if there is anyone found without the stamp on his card, he or she will be executed and all others are to move to the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was then in the course of four days with great violence, and great shooting and blood, uh driven to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> on four consecutive days and driven and taken to what I believe...and maybe some people believed to...was this <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">Me and my brother stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">We were assigned jobs at the <span class="BUILDING">local factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">Uh that was kind of a random process.</sentence><sentence id="197">Those who who stayed were assigned to to work groups, and me in one...in a group that was doing construction on a housing construction on this large uh <span class="BUILDING">airplane engine factory</span> that was built by the Poles before the war but was not operating, now was operated by Benz or Mercedes Benz if you wish.</sentence><sentence id="198">They are the same company, and my brother was assigned to the same <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> but in another group where they were doing repairs of damaged airplane engines.</sentence><sentence id="199">And so we we were marched under guard every day to that to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, about uh five miles or maybe five kilometers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in separate groups and we worked.</sentence><sentence id="200">The work was hard and miserable but we worked and we came back and we met at night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and uh hoping to hear something from our parents because we believed, or at least I believed...I had no reason not to...that they are someplace in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And of course that was...there's no suspense then and of course they all went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">destruction camp</span> and all the people were driven naked into <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and killed.</sentence><sentence id="202">After about three weeks of working in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, one day...and our group was maybe a group of hundred people...after about three weeks of working and the marching every day to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, one day when the work, when the job was over, the officials in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> said to us you are not going back.</sentence><sentence id="203">We have built a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh within the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, right outside the <span class="DLF">factory walls</span> but kind of adjoining the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and you're staying here tonight.</sentence><sentence id="204">You're not going back.</sentence><sentence id="205">So we were taken there and the name of the camp was Reischof, and I need to look at my piece of paper here to tell you how it was spelled.</sentence><sentence id="206">It was spelled R - E -1-S-C-H-O-F. And uh when we were marched to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, we discovered there were about three hundred other Jewish people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">Most of them were people who were selected in the process of deportation and during the day's deportation there were people who had professions like watchmakers or watch repairmen or locksmiths uh because this was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in which they needed people that knew something about uh uh mechanical or metal working, either mechanical work or metal work.</sentence><sentence id="208">Apparently we were taken to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh a long period of three years, almost three years, started.</sentence><sentence id="209">Uh this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of some that varied between three hundred and five hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="210">Virtually all Jews.</sentence><sentence id="211">Uh the work was uh was inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and inside the the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> working on lathe or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drill presses</span> for some of us.</sentence><sentence id="212">For others like me, working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in <span class="BUILDING">construction</span> or sweeping the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and before I tell you more about the conditions and what happened, let me say something about my brother.</sentence><sentence id="213">My brother continued to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which they repaired airplane engines.</sentence><sentence id="214">So L...so he was still...he was not confined to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">His group continued to come every day to uh to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and since I was, my job was to sweep the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, I managed to sweep the <span class="DLF">street</span> under the <span class="DLF">window</span> in which he worked and so we could say hello to each other, and that continued for about four months and uh sometimes in late uh late "42, his group as well as the remnants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that the Poles, all those people was the was their was the stamps on their ID cards and including some other groups that was still going to work from the from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and shipped on to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> on the in the east.</sentence><sentence id="216">I I discovered it when I went to see my brother that the group was not uh no longer working there, that they were deported.</sentence><sentence id="217">I was , and that week a man whom...this was in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, a man whom I knew before the war who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with my brother, came to see me and gave me a note from my brother and that note indicated that he jumped out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and joined the partisans, so he continued to to exist in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> together with partisans.</sentence><sentence id="218">I continued to receive notes from him on and off without telling me very much about where he is or his what name he was using for a year.</sentence><sentence id="219">In September...I think it was the 7th of September, 1943...he sent me a note through some people that worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that he is about to enter on a mission which will prevent him from uh contacting me and that we shall see each other after the war and that we should find each other by writing once the war is over to our uncle and aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and this would be a way to find out each other.</sentence><sentence id="220">Needless to say, I have never heard from him since then.</sentence><sentence id="221">I have no idea what happened but I can guess that he like countless others didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="222">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was (cough) very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="223">Life was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="224">There was hunger.</sentence><sentence id="225">There was beating.</sentence><sentence id="226">There were there were the guards were Ukrainians and they they were quite cruel and and miserable.</sentence><sentence id="227">Our our overseers, our masters were were Germans, German civilians who were also unpleasant.</sentence><sentence id="228">Our Polish co-workers really didn't show any sympathy and given that it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which I was I I was born in, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which I grew up (coughing)...excuse me...every once in a while I'll meet someone whom I knew before the war who was maybe...they were they were not my age because I was too young to to really be there, but they were maybe older brothers of my friends, and their reaction to seeing me was, are you still alive.</sentence><sentence id="229">And so that was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and whatever whatever comfort there was, we found in each other.</sentence><sentence id="230">People who were strangers, people who maybe didn't like each other, found a special fellowship, special kinship with each other and we tried to support each other and tried to help each other.(Cough) Another thing...a thing happened to me which is one of those incidents that uh that reoccurred over and over during the war where something happened over which I had really no control or or when it happened I had really no way to project what it will lead to that allowed me, that that that saved my life and gave me an opportunity to continue, you know, with my struggle to survive.</sentence><sentence id="231">The first of them was this incident of finding a man in the in the labor department who was my brother's teacher.</sentence><sentence id="232">I mean there was really no way that I would have managed, especially at my age, to have my card approved.</sentence><sentence id="233">What happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh I started working after maybe eight months of working <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>, sweeping <span class="DLF">streets</span> and working on construction, I was assigned to work inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I was marched to that large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and led in together with all the other people inside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and was walking through the <span class="BUILDING">factory building</span> to my assigned place of work (cough) and I noticed that in front of me there was a man ina white coat walking and something fell out of his pocket and instinctively I ran after him, picked up that envelope it was, and chased him and gave him that envelope, and he kind of looked of me and was pleased.</sentence><sentence id="234">The look appeared pleased and walked away.</sentence><sentence id="235">It turned out that night when the police came looking for me that it was his pay envelope and he was one of the German engineers working.</sentence><sentence id="236">Now they came looking for me because he wanted to tell me that he appreciated me returning his money to him, that it was really surprising that somebody who's Jewish would not steal it but return him the money, and frankly when I discovered it was money I was had some second thoughts of whether I should have done it or not.</sentence><sentence id="237">About six months later I we I was working on a...cleaning windows, standing on a long <span class="DLF">ladder</span>, because in addition to working twelve hours a shift in the inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, we were required to work in the evening, on weekends and doing other work and I was standing on this long <span class="DLF">ladder</span> cleaning a <span class="DLF">window</span> above a <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> when one of the German guard guards kicked the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> from under me.</sentence><sentence id="238">I fell down and there was a <span class="DLF">grate</span> at the bottom in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> which are common in Europe on which people were able to scrape their shoes.</sentence><sentence id="239">Anyway I fell, uh cut my knee.</sentence><sentence id="240">It was very badly damaged and injured and since we had no physicians and no medicine, it was infected and my knee was stiff and I really couldn't walk.</sentence><sentence id="241">I was running high temperature and after a number of weeks of being sick and miserable, I was selected together some others uh to be to be driven to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> which we believed was really a place where they executed people that were not useful.</sentence><sentence id="242">And uh I was too sick and too beaten to really to care, to really be able to resist it.</sentence><sentence id="243">And as I was sitting on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or standing on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with maybe six or eight or other people, that uh German master came by, the German engineer.</sentence><sentence id="244">He recognized me and uh said oh, this is a very important worker that I cannot spare and took me off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and a job was assigned to me, a wonderful job...the best job one could have there...to be a janitor cleaning uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">That may sound strange but this was a job that one had some degree of freedom because there was not a supervisor that stood over one.</sentence><sentence id="246">One could go walk and go and clean and and it gave me an opportunity in the next four or five months to recover, but again that little incident was one of those and there were others and I will mention them as I go along, that that were those lucky things for which I claim no responsibility because when I found the envelope and gave it back to him, I had no way of knowing that where it's going to lead.</sentence><sentence id="247">Anyhow it was one those lucky incidents that allowed me to continue.</sentence><sentence id="248">Uh we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, working.</sentence><sentence id="249">Uh there were a number of miserable things...some uh executions and killing and beating and hunger and misery.</sentence><sentence id="250">I remember one incident that I 1 remember it quite well because I could never really understand it and I still don't.</sentence><sentence id="251">One day...it must have been spring of "43 when the leaves were turning green and and uh weather was turning turn turning nice, when two young men and they must have been nineteen or twenty, young prisoners, escaped.</sentence><sentence id="252">They tunneled themselves under the <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">It was on a Saturday or on a weekend.</sentence><sentence id="254">On a Sunday it must have been because we did work on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="255">They tunneled themselves under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and escaped and there was much excitement and the Poles living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood villages</span> joined the Ukrainian guards in chasing them and they were caught by the by the two, by the Ukrainian guards with the help of the Polish peasants, brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> badly, very badly beaten and uh somehow the the authorities, the guards sent for the German Gestapo man who incidentally survived the war and was not not punished very much but that's another story...sent for the Gestapo man to come to deal with this breach of of order.</sentence><sentence id="256">And I remember he came on a in a in a kind of horse-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> with his wife who was...he must have been a young man in his thirties with his young wife and two little children, really blonde, pink (ph) children.</sentence><sentence id="257">Left them sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> outside of the <span class="DLF">camp gate</span> and uh the kids were running around.</sentence><sentence id="258">The wife was sitting over there while he went <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, tortured the two men and executed them, and I could never understand how a person who obviously had tender feelings for his family, who thought that it was a good opportunity to take his wife and children on a Sunday spring outing, would just transition from by just crossing the <span class="DLF">threshold</span> of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and to become a a terri...a terrible torturer and executioner, but these were the things that happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I'm trying to remember...it was a long period of about a year and a half.</sentence><sentence id="260">Difficult work.</sentence><sentence id="261">Difficult conditions.</sentence><sentence id="262"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hunger</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">Uh many tragedies, people trying to escape and being caught and and brought back and people executed but in the passage of time in spring of 1944 or maybe it was...yeah, it was late winter 1944 when...you understand that I was taken to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in July of "42 and about a year and a half later in spring of "44, the Russians were coming.</sentence><sentence id="264">The Ger...the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was advancing and uh and uh they were not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but they were someplace in in <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span>, but anyway they were close enough and as you may know the Russian advances were kind of .</sentence><sentence id="265">They will advance uh a hundred miles and then stop for a few months waiting I suppose for their supplies and logistics to catch up with them.</sentence><sentence id="266">Anyway the Russians were advancing and the Germans decided to evacuate most of their key machinery in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as well as us, those four or five hundred Jewish prisoners who were in the camp who by that time were considered kind of specialists or important people.</sentence><sentence id="267">So one night in a great panic the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> showed up and the machines were being loaded and dis...(cough)...uh disconnected from the electric uh wiring and loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left and the next day the rest of us were put on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that arrived and shipped west toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="268">Uh however in the interim between the time when the machines were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to be shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the next day when we were deported, a number of people managed to escape.</sentence><sentence id="269">There was a group of uh about eighteen people that escaped because the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were open.</sentence><sentence id="270">There was confusion.</sentence><sentence id="271">They escaped, uh and I have met one of the escapees after the war and who...and he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> now and it turned out that they escaped.</sentence><sentence id="272">They were hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, I should say, and then encountered the Polish national army resistance group who looked upon hiding Jews as bandits and they were, all but one were killed by the Polish resistance group.</sentence><sentence id="273">Our group in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved very slowly west, and we were deposited in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> (ph) which was a major uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">execution camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in which most of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> was liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="275">It was located in a on the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> of a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there we were given new numbers.</sentence><sentence id="276">Incidentally, I had...my number in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp 222</span>, a very low number.</sentence><sentence id="277">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruschov</span> I had the number of 25,113, and assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and made to work digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the in the ground which was full of skeletons and and uh <span class="DLF">graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">We were just digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> and filling them in but it was...it was really a brutal and terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">Uh people were beaten at random.</sentence><sentence id="280">There were continuous execution, almost random execution of prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="281">We stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> maybe a month, and then sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was even worse, uh not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="282">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was well-known for having major <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> and uh my ancestors lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">I didn't say that my my original name in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was Salzman (ph) and uh that means salt man and my...I, as I recall the story of I heard from my father, my ancestors lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and their business was to buy and transport salt to the neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and when in the late 17th century or maybe it was early 18th century, the tax 0 officials decided that everyone including Jews must have last name for tax purposes, and they just called my...they assigned a name to my great-great-grandfather uh that he had...uh that was associated with his occupation, so that's where the Salzman came and it was at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Well, OK.</sentence><sentence id="409">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a very crowded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">There were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in which there were great crowds of prisoners uh sleeping on kind of a three tier shelves.</sentence><sentence id="411">Uh food was very very limited.</sentence><sentence id="412">Our work was uh basically hard like labor where it was really no skill required and which made anyone of us expendable.</sentence><sentence id="413">Working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...if someone's working on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drill press</span> there was some value to one's identity, because if that operator of the drill press was executed, the drill press would idle until they found somebody else that they could train, but digging <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was really black labor, labor that was, that had no identity.</sentence><sentence id="414">It was just uh kind of useless labor and we were all vulnerable to be beaten or executed uh and uh one just existed from day to day.</sentence><sentence id="415">One just had a a kind of a inwards determination and to one's mind and to one's heart to just kind of bear with it, to to somehow avoid being identified, never to stand in the front row and if one marched in columns of five to be in the middle rather than the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, to to appear busy, to avert one's eyes, to to be driven by an instinct for survival which was I think is in all of us.</sentence><sentence id="416">The other thing that was different about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span>in in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the first time I encountered uh women prisoners, Jewish women prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="417">They were I believe from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and it was it was an additional injury to my humanity to see women about whom I have romanticized, because I was just a young man of sixteen you know, being compelled to work hard and being compelled to walk around half dressed and to not being given any facilities for sanitary purposes that somehow gave them some degree of privacy, and all those things kind of added together to make us, to make me feel uh less than a human being really,but feel as a kind of a uh uh...a a a machine that whose purpose was to avoid exposure, to avoid any kind of a risk and just survive by uh obeying and following and doing the kind of things that I felt uh uh avoided uh being singled out by people, by the guards and by the SS supervisors who uh amused themselves I believe or satisfied some of their sadistic uh drives by beating and and killing people for no reason at all and and what one had to do is somehow be both lucky and be sufficiently assertive to avoid that situation when one could be singled out.</sentence><sentence id="418">Uh II avoided it, not because I was really more aggressive than the others, but because I I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="419">So that...when I look upon those months there, just months of of of ailment, of a of a sickness of mind and body...</sentence></p></dialogue>

did.</sentence><sentence id="471">And and and again I am saying this kind of unskilled labor was the most dangerous job to to do because there was no value in any individual worker.</sentence><sentence id="472">There were there were thousands of hundreds of thousands of people gassed and killed every day so there was basically unlimited supply of replacements.</sentence><sentence id="473">Things have changed.</sentence><sentence id="474">At at the end of one week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vileshka</span>, the four hundred or four

west.</sentence><sentence id="476">It was first...it was the first indication 2 that the identity of that group that worked for a year and a half in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reischof</span> was still retained and had some meaning.</sentence><sentence id="477">It was a very long trip and for people that survived the <span

in a <span class="REGION">mountainous region</span> uh where we were made to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, those of the few people that died along the way...we were made to leave

time.</sentence><sentence id="509">They would give us one bowl of soup for two people.</sentence><sentence id="510">You have to remember a bowl of watery soup with some leaves or some piece of potato in it for two people who each one of them equipped with his own spoon and and this was ready made for conflict and combat and and and and uh the the spilling of soup and so on, but somehow before I arrived a a custom was developed over there 3 where the two prisoners, skeleton-looking hungary prisoners who would be given this bowl of soup to share, would feed each other, so if you gave me half a spoon, I gave you half a spoon.</sentence><sentence id="511">And if you dipped down and found a piece of potato, I'll dip down and give you a piece of potato, and so that customs or that habits or that arrangement which had both philosophical and not religious undertones, people managed to people who were strangers, people who were dying of hunger managed somehow to be disciplined and to go through that daily ritual of sharing the bowl of soup.</sentence><sentence id="512">After six weeks of work and hard labor...oh yes...I'm I'm forgetting something...when we first came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span>, we were marched by this young SS guards with their dogs up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we we were brought before a very large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in a kind of assembly area, and we were...there were four hundred and fifty of us approximately, and we were all told to undress, to leave our clothing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and all our possessions and we go in to take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">Now there was concern.</sentence><sentence id="514">There was speculation, because by that time we knew about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="515">We knew that our parents who were who went to the to the allegedly were sent to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the east were really killed and sent to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">We knew about that, and there was great concern that we may be taken to a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">This was typical...this the thing...undress...go in naked.</sentence><sentence id="518">But there were really no choices.</sentence><sentence id="519">The choice was to resist and be killed, to run, to fight, to or to just hope and to do what one was told and hope that it was true that what they said that we will take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">I did that.</sentence><sentence id="521">I left my clothing and I left what whatever little possessions I had of my own that I carried through all the years of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and these possessions were a little handkerchief in which I had tied photographs of my brother and my parents, and after that we were really given <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and when the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> was over, made out...made to go out through another <span class="DLF">door</span> where we were given new stripped uniform and uh and uh wooden shoes and all those things that we left behind we have never seen again, so I have not had a picture of my parents until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where my aunt uh gave me a picture of my parents when they were first married.</sentence><sentence id="522">This uh...1 remember them only vaguely that way, and I have no picture of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="523">We worked.</sentence><sentence id="524">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> for about six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="525">Worked very hard and one time we were exposed to a selection.</sentence><sentence id="526">Uh selection was a process where everybody stood naked and the a few SS people, one of them I believe a physician, kind of went by and marked us with a green ink writing numbers or some symbols on our forehead and he did it to me too.</sentence><sentence id="527">I don't know what it meant and we didn't know or we didn't care anyway.</sentence><sentence id="528">Didn't know, didn't care, but that night again our group was assembled, put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...that group of four hundred and fifty.</sentence><sentence

seven days we arrived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...we didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="536">I mean I got...when I say <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> I mean that's in retrospect.</sentence><sentence id="537">At that time we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="538">Along the way experienced great hostility from the Germans along the

that I am that I am about those other <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were terrible because it was a a unique encounter with human kindness which I had forgotten about.</sentence><sentence id="669">After a week we were put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again, again after a few, two days of traveling, arrived in a kind of a <span class="REGION">mountainous area</span> called uh in which which we discovered was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orbas</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="670">It's a small, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in in <span class="REGION">eastern France</span> in which there was a unfinished <span class="DLF">railroad tunnel</span> and in inside the <span class="DLF">railroad tunnel</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> set up to manufacture airplane engines and most of the machines and many of the supervisors were those people back in 6 Reischof uh who were who left sometimes back in in March.</sentence><sentence id="671">Again uh circumstances of of luck that for which I take no responsibility and decisions that were made outside of my presence uh completely outside of any influence that we had, that some German officials in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or whatever, decided that it is valuable to retain this group of four hundred and fifty specialists which they considered us at that time, and had us catch up with the machinery that was being transferred to defense (ph) and uh uh absent that, we would certain not survived because working in <span class="DLF">stone quarries</span> or <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> or some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> was a job where one survived for only weeks and we worked with Frenchmen, uh guarded by Germans but working with Frenchmen in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and it was a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="672">The French workers that we worked with, the French worker I worked with shared his food that he brought with him...they used to bring a lunch bucket and they usually shared an apple or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="673">Uh on weekends I was made to work in the in the in a <span class="BUILDING">farm complex</span> in which the SS were located washing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> for soldiers and as I did that strangers would throw apples or other things to me and uh and uh, you know, the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was pretty.</sentence><sentence id="674">There were hills with goats on it and little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and uh we were still unhappy and miserable and the guards would still uh the SS guards that guarded the thing was still cruel.</sentence><sentence id="675">They have uh a few people were shot and killed.</sentence><sentence id="676">One man was told by a young guard I remember who was maybe nineteen to hey, run away and he ran and as he ran about six feet, the man killed him, but it was a different environment.</sentence><sentence id="677">It was a somewhat better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">One night I remember I was walking through this <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">I was made to carry something and uh on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there was a piece of newspaper with a large headline, and my judgment wasn't very good at that time and I picked it up and stuck inside my jacket and then that night when we looked at it, it said in German, <span class="REGION">fortress Europe</span> under attack.</sentence><sentence id="680">It uh really was the D-Day invasion and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> by the Allied Forces from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="681">It was very reassuring.</sentence><sentence id="682">We were happy about it, but we really didn't know exactly where we were.</sentence><sentence id="683">We didn't know how the Americans were doing and the the Allies were doing.</sentence><sentence id="684">The newspaper was not uh uh was not really honest.</sentence><sentence id="685">It's kind of said they attacked but they are being beaten back.</sentence><sentence id="686">But finally we didn't expect really anything good to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="687">We didn't expect...the whole idea of being liberated or being free or being autonomous was strange.</sentence><sentence id="688">We were conditioned now to be prisoners, to live in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, to be given cabbage soup, to be told what to do, to be completely without rights, to be beaten, you know, and so anyway the Americans were coming and in August as you remember...the Americans landed in June of "44.</sentence><sentence id="689">They was landing in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> uh by early in August as I as I believe, and in August of "44 they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and shipped us east.</sentence><sentence id="690">First the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> left and then we left.</sentence><sentence id="691">As our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.884512" long="6.959216">Colmar</span>, we looked out the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="692">On our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> with four hundred and fifty of us...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and we would looked...no, we looked.</sentence><sentence id="693">We were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">We were looking out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with all the machines that we worked on sitting on the <span class="DLF">side railing</span>, completely destroyed by a air raid and we knew that that connection was behind us, that connection with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">Incidentally this is also the time of the...in retrospect when there was the last attempt on Hitler's life in August of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="696">I just remembered now.</sentence><sentence id="697">Uh was a long, long journey.</sentence><sentence id="698">Many people, a number of people died from hunger and thirst.</sentence><sentence id="699">We arrived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="700">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp 7</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="701">It was one of the largest camps in uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my number over there...just to tell you how big...was 107,081.</sentence><sentence id="702">I was under the name the name of Salzman (ph).</sentence><sentence id="703">We were put in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the four hundred and fifty of us were assigned to work in a in a in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where iron devices like uh axles for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and so on were being stored and we were caused to move it and required to move it and assemble it and pile it and so on.</sentence><sentence id="704">I don't know that there was really any sense to it.</sentence><sentence id="705">It was hardness of the work...uh same thing again.</sentence><sentence id="706">Beating, hunger, uh uh rejection again.</sentence><sentence id="707">I know I'm kind of not emphasizing here...that I'm...but you know, we just was there.</sentence><sentence id="708">That's how life was.</sentence><sentence id="709">There was nothing exciting that happened from day to day.</sentence><sentence id="710">One got up and one hoped that it wouldn't rain and one hoped that the shoe which didn't have a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in.</sentence><sentence id="711">One hoped that one got into <span class="DLF">line</span> to to get one's soup.</sentence><sentence id="712">If one was at the right point in the <span class="DLF">line</span> so when one got the the bowl of soup it wasn't from the top but was from the bottom of the of the of the container where there was a little bit more cabbage and these were the things that occupied our life.</sentence><sentence id="713">There wasn't anything dramatic or wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="714">Was just to survive to and little things in life were the kind of things that allowed us to somehow sustain ourselves another day.</sentence><sentence id="715">Uh if one uh was required to move a big piece of iron, one somehow tried to do utmost to have six people rather than four people, because four people carrying that piece of iron would be so much more difficult that one's ability to survive, to somehow carry another day, would be diminished.</sentence><sentence id="716">So I don't know what others say, but I must tell you those monontenous terrible days were were occupied by the by the compulsion to survive, by doing those little tiny things, you know, by somehow uh being able to find a needle to fix one's pants or to sew on a button because one needed this button to be warm and one needed the button to look orderly and proper, to not somehow be singled out by a guard who could use that for whatever purpose he wanted to use.</sentence><sentence id="717">After...at at the time, the time, the days passed one after another.</sentence><sentence id="718">There were...it was a terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">There were French resistance prisoners, from the French resistance who were made to...they were being made to walk all day long in leg chains and and there were random hangings.</sentence><sentence id="720">There were other people in a in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> uh company that were that were caused to march everyday with a new pair of German military shoes because they wanted to...when they issued the shoes to the German soldiers they wanted the shoes to be worn for at least one day so these people had to march all day long, and it was just...it was an awful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but after about a number of weeks, an announcement, an announcement was made that our group of about four hundred and fifty who were somehow identified as machine machine operators or or lathe (ph) operator specialists, was being shipped, was being sent to two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, one outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721">Now I...we just knew...1 I must tell you we are told we are being shipped to two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">I don't know that we knew at that time.</sentence><sentence id="723">I guess we knew that we...one group was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span> and another group was being sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="724">And the way it was done that orderly would say well we need seven lathe operators to go here and five uh drill press operators to go there and because they allowed it that way rather than saying you and you go there, people that had some connection with each other, either because they were from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or because they knew each other, managed to stay together, and they would just be assigned and we continued going to work and about four or five days later there was a list posted 8 by number...all of us had numbers...I had this number that I said, 107,081, and there was a list posted of the people that were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">I originally was supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span> and not that I had any knowledge of whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span> is better or not, but the people that I knew from before the war and some of the people I knew for a long time were going there and I just wanted to stay with people on whom one could count as a little bit of support.</sentence><sentence id="726">Well, I discovered that in the process of assembling the final list, there was some changes and about forty or so people were shifted and I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="727">Another person that was shifted with me was a young man who had a cousin by the name of Joe Senga (ph) that was allowed to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">I hope I'm not confusing it.</sentence><sentence id="729">Some of us that was supposed to go was shipped here and this cousin said I want to go with my cousin because we're just cousins and that's most unusual among those few survivors that that there was their cousins or brothers.</sentence><sentence id="730">Well, this cousin said uh I don't know what fate has for me.</sentence><sentence id="731">They assigned me here and I'm going to stay...I don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="732">Well, anyway, after much ado and much suffering, Joe Senga and I changed uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="733">He put my uniform with your number on the side and so on and I took his uniform.</sentence><sentence id="734">He told me his name and his date of birth.</sentence><sentence id="735">He was incidentally born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chemish</span> too, but he was eighteen and I was sixteen at that time and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span> with his cousin...I'm sorry...he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> with his cousin and I, under his name, stayed with my friends and and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...fellow townspeople in that group that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.2637901" long="10.526843">Braunschweig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="736">Uh of that group of two hundred or twenty or forty that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, only one survived I found out after the war.</sentence><sentence id="737">And all the others uh died and uh Senga who carried my name didn't make it either.</sentence><sentence id="738">Again, one of those lucky incidents.</sentence><sentence id="739">Lucky.</sentence><sentence id="740">One of those fateful incidents where, you know, I really didn't know which one was better, and I did it, you know, just for reasons to please him and to go with my...the people I knew.</sentence><sentence id="741">Our group of some two hundred and twenty...I would guess about twenty-five, twenty-eight survived and I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="742">None of the others.</sentence><sentence id="743">And I...remember I say twenty-five, twenty-eight.</sentence><sentence id="744">Maybe it was thirty-two.</sentence><sentence id="745">It was some small number survived and nevertheless I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="746">I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.137461" long="10.436549">Watenstedt</span> (ph) is the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

about two hundred and fifty of us and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was attached to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in which they manufactured the casings for bombs and therefore there was a need for lathe operators and all that stuff and it was one of those...as as the war was going on, the time was passing, conditions were getting worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="749">There was much less food.</sentence><sentence id="750">The the guards were much more cruel and there was no clothing and anyway we we got there in October.</sentence><sentence id="751">I was now Joseph Senga, had a new number and my number was 107,028.</sentence><sentence id="752">I don't know why his number was smaller than mine and uh worked

cruel.</sentence><sentence id="755">They were...most of the people were uh from...well, there were no...very few Jews and people were dying like flies, either from hunger, from exhaustion.</sentence><sentence id="756">I have seen people arrive and be there for two, three weeks and then unless they were really hustling and competing, if they were trying to be some how accommodating of all the others who but all the other prisoners who by that time were very aggressive and would try to steal your bread or steal your soup just to survive, not out of villainy (ph), or they wouldn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="757">At one point there there were two French 9 people brought in who I was told were priests or bishops and they were just overwhelmed by the misery they saw around and were willing to share their food and they lasted two weeks and I'm not making any judgment about it but that's how it was.</sentence><sentence id="758">In January of...we got there in October...work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, try to keep warm.</sentence><sentence id="759">We had very little clothing.</sentence><sentence id="760">We got wooden shower shoes and very thin clothing.</sentence><sentence id="761">In January of 1945 the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed by B-17's I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="762">It was a daylight bomb and it was on a Sunday and we worked all the time except Sunday afternoon was free.</sentence><sentence id="763">And it was bombed on Sunday afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="764">Was completely destroyed and at that point, from that day on...well, anyway, from that day on we worked rebuilding the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, moving, building bricks, picking up pieces.</sentence><sentence id="765">It was just tremendous feel of gloom (ph) and also that night, the night of the bombing, snow for the first time, so when we went to work it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="766">It was cold.</sentence><sentence id="767">We had no gloves.</sentence><sentence id="768">We had no socks.</sentence><sentence id="769">We had no shoes and we just worked <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> moving bricks and moving uh moving uh stones and I have and uh this was the time when most of the people died, just from cold and exhaustion.</sentence><sentence id="770">We would sleep two men to a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and I remember sleeving...slee... sleeping with a young man whom I knew for about two, three years now whose name was Hoffenflack (ph) and at night when I woke up, he was dead, and I couldn't push him out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> so I just slept there the rest of the night, but he was dead just from cold and not eating.</sentence><sentence id="771">Uh I need to go back for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="772">I said that in January when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed...in mid-December, the times were already very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="773">There was very little food.</sentence><sentence id="774">Someone recognized that I have some artistic talent and assigned me to work for those kind of two weeks before Christmas in a uh carpentry uh shop in which uh toys were being made for the children of the guards, so I worked designing drawing horses and ducks and the carpenters would would uh cut it out and assemble it into something they could draw on a string and all that.</sentence><sentence id="775">At one point one of the SS officers came in and said to me we need a star to put on top of our Christmas tree and design one and have it painted, but don't make it make a five-corner star because it's communist or a six-cornered star because it's Jewish, so I had to design an eight-corner star because uh that's how I knew how to do it, you know, because I just remembered that incident.</sentence><sentence id="776">During that time when I work in the <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shop</span> I was getting some extra food which I shared with a friend of mine, someone by the name of , Julius , who was somebody I knew from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="777">He was three years older than I was and he was with me and I was getting more food.</sentence><sentence id="778">I was able to share it with him and uh then when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed out, I was no longer working in the <span class="BUILDING">carpentry store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="779">I was working...in <span class="BUILDING">carpentry shop</span>... was working carrying bricks and cement.</sentence><sentence id="780">So was he, but he found in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> a a box of ration cards and remember at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had food rationing.</sentence><sentence id="781">He found a box of ration cards and made some contact with uh with a Polish worker who was there who was willing to trade those ration cards for extra bread, and he was able to help me.</sentence><sentence id="782">Again, those special circumstances that allowed me to be drawing Christmas tree stars and have some food to share with him and then allowed him by accident to have access to some additional bread which he was able to share with me.</sentence><sentence id="783">He shared with me because uh well, because we were friends I suppose and because he had enough for himself.</sentence><sentence id="784">But it was a very terrible time.</sentence><sentence id="785">There was very little food.</sentence><sentence id="786">There was very little...there was no clothing.</sentence><sentence id="787">It was cold, miserable.</sentence><sentence id="788">The German guards were even more cruel and we would find in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> some old drapery 0 material because they had...and we tried to either fashion gloves or vests or something and they would search us and if we had any gloves made out of drapery material or vests, they would take the take it away from us or we would find paper sacks from cement and try to use this as something to keep warm.</sentence><sentence id="789">They would also take it away from us and we marched to work every day and every night when we walked back we would have to carry fifty, sixty dead people who died during the uh during the day.</sentence><sentence id="790">That is how it went.</sentence><sentence id="791">People were just dying, just dying.</sentence><sentence id="792">There was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="793">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="794">People were just like flies.</sentence><sentence id="795">Uh those of us that survived uh again did the same thing and it it...there was no drama.</sentence><sentence id="796">There was nothing there.</sentence><sentence id="797">No no great things happened.</sentence><sentence id="798">There was no special danger.</sentence><sentence id="799">There was no special mercy.</sentence><sentence id="800">There was no...no one showed up to do anything good or bad.</sentence><sentence id="801">We just had to survive, day to day, survive.</sentence><sentence id="802">Finda piece of __ to tie around your shoes.</sentence><sentence id="803">Uh uh try to have a piece of paper around your body to keep warm and and avoid the German searching you and if uh if there was jobs being assigned, try to get to assigned to a job that was less exhausting than some other job, because it gave you a chance to live another day.</sentence><sentence id="804">And uh early 1945...I would guess it was uh maybe in late February, March...we heard guns on the horizon.</sentence><sentence id="805">Now we had no idea what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="806">By that time we didn't have any hope.</sentence><sentence id="807">We didn't nurture any hope.</sentence><sentence id="808">Of those two hundred and twenty or so of us that came to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, there were maybe forty, fifty alive.</sentence><sentence id="809">We didn't nurture...I was...specifically, I was sinking.</sentence><sentence id="810">There was in...there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> a condition called mussulman and I don't know what it comes from, but these were people who was...whose...who were so physically and mentally deteriorated that they no longer cared about survival.</sentence><sentence id="811">They kind of like wandered or staggered around.</sentence><sentence id="812">They fall down.</sentence><sentence id="813">They usually live for a day or two.</sentence><sentence id="814">I was approaching that condition.</sentence><sentence id="815">Times I was hungry.</sentence><sentence id="816">I was cold.</sentence><sentence id="817">I and I was sick.</sentence><sentence id="818">I know that and I remember talking to some people and saying I don't know if I can manage it another week or two, and they were saying come on...even though they were in the same condition.</sentence><sentence id="819">Even though some of them that said to me come on, you know, try, try...didn't make it themselves.</sentence><sentence id="820">Anyway, in early March...I'm estimating now...there were guns on the horizon.</sentence><sentence id="821">The Germans again put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and after a very long and very deadly journey uh we arrived in a...in the middle of the night someplace.</sentence><sentence id="822">We were made to get out of out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there were these mountains of bones, human bones, and it was kind of like something that an abstract picture of <span class="NPIP">hell</span>...just big piles of human bones.</sentence><sentence id="823">We walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="824">Turned out it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> (ph), which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mecklenberg</span> (ph) which was a major, primarily a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">There was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span> for men and uh we were kept there for two weeks, really doing nothing.</sentence><sentence id="826">Sitting in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="827">Uh all organization started breaking down.</sentence><sentence id="828">For example, when there was a distribution of slices of bread and they would they would have a ba...a basket of slices of bread and which you get one slice of bread a day and the the kapos who would hand it out would hand it out and as the people pushed, they would turn over the basket and everybody would attack it and grab it and and our belief was that the kapos did it because they kept some of the bread for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="829">They didn't have enough to to give each one of us a slice of bread, so then those that are a little bit stronger managed to have two pieces.</sentence><sentence id="830">Those that were either not in position or were weaker would die that day or the next day.</sentence><sentence id="831">I remember the sun was shining and I was kind of wandering around and 1 came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we had lice and we were dirty and we were just terrible and I came by a <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw my image in a <span class="DLF">window pane</span> and I didn't recognize myself, and I saw that I was a mussulman already.</sentence><sentence id="832">I saw that I was not making it.</sentence><sentence id="833">After about three weeks in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again and shipped us someplace else and when we arrived there we discovered that the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was .</sentence><sentence id="834">It was a camp that incidentally was liberated by the 82nd Airborne Division and if one reads Gavin's (ph) book uh Road to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, in the last chapter he talks about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> he says something that I don't remember...that you could smell that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before you saw it.</sentence><sentence id="835">I don't remember any obvious smells.</sentence><sentence id="836">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">But was half finished.</sentence><sentence id="838">We slept on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="839">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="840">Dead bodies all over.</sentence><sentence id="841">People were eating the dead bodies and uh everyone who sur...wanted to survive would do whatever one had to do to to eat uh whatever was available.</sentence><sentence id="842">Uh more people were dying.</sentence><sentence id="843">There were just mountains of dead people.</sentence><sentence id="844">They didn't bury them anymore.</sentence><sentence id="845">It was late in the war.</sentence><sentence id="846">It was April of...late April of "45.</sentence><sentence id="847">Of our group there were just a few, but there were some other Jews now by then there and then on May Ist, and I know the date in retrospect of course...on May Ist, we were all told to get in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="848">It was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was assembled and we were all told to get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="849">We all were marched in a <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="850">I couldn't walk anymore.</sentence><sentence id="851">I made the first first risky thing I did.</sentence><sentence id="852">When we were when we were assembled and were informed that we are leaving, they asked those who cannot walk will go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="853">The others will march.</sentence><sentence id="854">Those that cannot...that can walk step forward.</sentence><sentence id="855">And I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="856">I couldn't walk anymore.</sentence><sentence id="857">My head was hurting me and I couldn't walk.</sentence><sentence id="858">But it turned out they put us all on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, so that fact that I accepted now, that being singled out, showing some weakness that I had fought for three years to prevent, really didn't harm me.</sentence><sentence id="859">We were put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all night long and confined hundred, hundred and twenty people to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span>, and there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> and in the morning they made us walk out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and stand there between the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was and the <span class="DLF">front fence</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="860">The the way it was arranged the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> has two pieces, two <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">There was a camp of the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="862">There were <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and on the other side of the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> there was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the guards lived, so we were there and uh my... don't know...maybe four thousand prisoners although there was lot of death later on, and they said all Jews step forward.</sentence><sentence id="863">And we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="864">I mean I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="865">Uh some of the...well, of course this was not announced the way they announce it now.</sentence><sentence id="866">It was announced...it was de...demanded with threat and with violence and some of the non-Jewish prisoners started pointing us out.</sentence><sentence id="867">It was possible for us to be identified because we would have a red triangle showing that we are political, but there were little three yellow corners behind it to make that into a star of David and in all that tumult and confusion...this was now May 2nd...there was a...I'm again coming to an emotional time...there was a gunshot and we all looked down the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> which was kind of like a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> cut in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and in May there were...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were already green and far away there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">It looked kind of like a prehistoric monster with smoke coming out of it and was maybe a mile away, but the Germans just opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, pushed us all in, and we were still guarded.</sentence><sentence id="869">There were still guards in the in the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and they kept shooting at random at uh at the ca...at the prisoners and one had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide behind a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> not to be exposed to line of 2 fire and uh then they took the German trustees out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="870">And we were kind of alone and I remember finding someplace three potatoes, because they...whatever supplies there were were no longer guarded by the German trustees, by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span>, and cooking those three potatoes in the fire, baking and making little fires...others did it too...a little fire behind...and it was afternoon and then I hear noises.</sentence><sentence id="871">People running and shouting and I really didn't want to leave the three potatoes but I was concerned that maybe something bad is happening, and I was still, had sufficient instinct for survival that I needed to know what's happening. __</sentence><sentence id="872">I couldn't walk very well and my head hurt.</sentence><sentence id="873">I and I I suppose maybe I was stimulated by that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and which obviously was a friendly one, or at least unfriendly to the Germans, so I ran to see what all these people were running and there were Americans. (</sentence><sentence id="874">Crying) They were soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="875">There was a patrol of 82nd Airborne soldiers inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> standing among these mountains of bodies and thousand or two thousand crazy prisoners jumping and hugging each other and kissing each other and uh I really didn't feel it.</sentence><sentence id="876">I didn't know what it meant.</sentence><sentence id="877">And they were there.</sentence><sentence id="878">They were overwhelmed and they left.</sentence><sentence id="879">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">They were not going to...oh yes, when they...when we jumped and screamed and saw the Americans, we looked around.</sentence><sentence id="881">There were no guards in the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span>, and when the Americans left, when those...when the patrol of six or seven soldiers left, and we...some of us...people continued still dying.</sentence><sentence id="882">There were lots of people that were dying laying around and some people started leaving and me and five friends, , the one that I mentioned before , and another was a man I knew from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who was an older brother of that young man back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who had a certificate on his on his identification paper that he had some physical ailment and should be excused...we decided based on the stories we heard from the...from our parents on what happened in the first war when the Russians and the Austrians keep moving back and forth, so the Americans left and the Germans may be coming back.</sentence><sentence id="883">We really didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="884">We left at night.</sentence><sentence id="885">We jumped...the <span class="DLF">door</span>, <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open and the five of us just left, went went walking in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and hiding over there.</sentence><sentence id="886">At one point we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called that was still in German hands and we hid in a little <span class="BUILDING">paint store</span> and that night the Americans came and I was free.</sentence><sentence id="887">I didn't try very hard to...1 was seventeen.</sentence><sentence id="888">I tried very hard to write a letter to my aunt and uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and I didn't know their address anymore because among the things that I left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> with the photographs was the address of my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="889">I knew that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">I knew that there was MD attached to his name and I didn't know exactly what it meant or I knew that he was a physician and uh needless to say I finally got through to him.</sentence><sentence id="891">None of them...1 I | asked every soldier, American or English, to send a letter for me and none of the letters arrived but one of the GI's came back and brought a letter with him and looked him up in the phone book in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and called him and uh I just you know, I made contact with relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="892">I discovered that no one else has survived, none of my family, and the part of Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where I was liberated, became...was destined to become the eastern, the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, now part of eastern rather than East, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and uh the Americans wanted to uh put uh on turn us over to the Russians because they were shipping people that were from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and people that were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> back east and that day the Russians didn't...they put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and brought us out to 3 the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the Russian's <span class="DLF">lines</span> were.</sentence><sentence id="893">The Russians didn't want to accept us that day.</sentence><sentence id="894">I don't know if that would have made any difference in my life, but at least they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="895">So then the British picked us up and took us in a on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span>, <span

days is a photograph of myself, how I looked uh about three or four months after I was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="897">I have no other photographs of of anyone else, but that...and when the war was over there was some already institutional things started and one needed papers and so I went to a photographer and had a picture taken.</sentence><sentence id="898">As you can see...I think there is a date on it.</sentence><sentence id="899">The date is...OK...here we're looking...1st June of "45 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubeck</span> which would be a month after I was liberated and being seventeen and having access to food which the American soldiers around were kind enough to share with us, I was recovering.</sentence><sentence id="900">I mean my hair started

was kind of like sitting around and uh to occupy myself or to maybe to to give give vent to some emotional needs I had I started painting and I painted some pictures.</sentence><sentence

it.</sentence><sentence id="1182">I'm saying this because when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and moved with my uncle who was a successful physician, who had great uh had friends who were musicians in the New 4 York Symphony and who had candles at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> and friends __, it was a very difficult transition for
