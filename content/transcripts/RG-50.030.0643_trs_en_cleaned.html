<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Oh gosh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Well, she -- she was -- I'm sure she had some ill health, but if she -- if she did, I know, had a stomach operation early in her marriage.</sentence><sentence id="303">I have a feeling it all -- it had to do with nerves too, you know?</sentence><sentence id="304">And then she, in 1929 she had a major operation, I -- I don't know if it was a hysterectomy, or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="305">And what is very unfortunate, she had a surgeon who was addicted to morphine, and he got her addicted.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Oh dear, what a tragedy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: And that was very unfortunate, because she was really a very wonderful person.</sentence><sentence id="317">But of course, I was only nine when this started, so I never really knew what a wonderful</sentence><sentence id="319">person she was.</sentence><sentence id="320">I knew it mainly through other people, who told me about it.</sentence><sentence id="321">She was, you know, she had -- of course had not gone to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, but she was pretty smart, and she had a lot of common sense.</sentence><sentence id="322">And she was very -- she had a lot of empathy.</sentence><sentence id="323">And I'l tell you a little story, during the depression, you know, in -- starting in 1930, I guess, when there was so much poverty in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, she started a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Wow.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: And it's one of my most vivid memories.</sentence><sentence id="337">We -- the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> was on the side, and the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> had -- had sort of a <span class="DLF">window</span> you could raise up to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338">And we would have, every day, about 20 people who came.</sentence><sentence id="339">After a while, we started giving out little slips to people, to say which day they could come, and -- with their name.</sentence><sentence id="340">And I know I used to write those slips, which is why I remember it so well.</sentence><sentence id="341">And then they would come starting at noon, and our cook would have a big soup, you know, something substantial, and bread.</sentence><sentence id="342">And we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">And if it was raining, we put them in the -- one of the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">And then the people would eat their lun-lunch, or main meal, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="345">In fact, we had one couple that found each other and got married.</sentence><sentence id="346">And then on Christmas, she always had everybody come, and she -- they got -- the men got shaving cream and stuff like that, and the women got some other stuff.</sentence><sentence id="347">He -- they -- they all got the little bag with goodies.</sentence><sentence id="348">So she really, I mean, and that was entirely my mother's make -- doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: That's a very kind thought.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: And she really, I mean, that's the kind of person she was.</sentence><sentence id="369">But, of course, the addiction was dreadful, because you know, a-an addiction to morphine is the same as -- as a heroin addiction, or any other.</sentence><sentence id="370">It's unpredictable.</sentence><sentence id="371">The mood can be -- one day you think, oh, she's wonderful, and then you talk a lot, and then the next day she's gone again, you know.</sentence><sentence id="372">And -- and she did go into <span class="BUILDING">rehab</span> twice in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and then it was better for a while, but it never lasted.</sentence><sentence id="373">And then when she came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- you know, I don't know where she got her morphine.</sentence><sentence id="374">That's sometimes the curse of having money.</sentence><sentence id="375">And -- but a -- it was the same in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tucson</span>, where she lived, I mean, she -- and in the end, it wa -- was just awful.</sentence><sentence id="376">But you know, tha-that is -- that was very sad, really.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="387">And hard for children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: But, you know, it -- the one thing I-- I -- I have told this to my kids from the day they were born, in order to make sure that they stayed away from all drugs, because I told them how horrible this is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="392">Q: Well, the price that people pay.</sentence><sentence id="393">The price that the family pays, the price that the person pays.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: It-- it's -- it's -- it's really very sad.</sentence><sentence id="397">But, you know -- and -- and I know -- I mean, we all know it was -- it was her surgeon who got her addicted, and he was addicted him -- a lot of doctors are addicted, I think.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: Well, before that happened, you would have been nine years or less, but you mention that your parents would go out in the evenings.</sentence><sentence id="403">Did they -- did they enjoy each other's company?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: Yes, they did.</sentence><sentence id="405">And -- and, as I think I want to -- I mean, they got divorced in 38.</sentence><sentence id="406">I think it had na -- it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that my mother was Jewish, and my father wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="407">My sister and I saw that divorce coming for years.</sentence><sentence id="408">Which doesn't mean they weren't friendly.</sentence><sentence id="409">They were very friendly, they always talked to each other and -- and -- but, you know, I -- it's very hard to look at your parents and think about sex.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: That's true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: But I think it was very -- they were incompatible.</sentence><sentence id="419">That's what I think, you know, and I think that my father wasn't that interested in it, and my mother was more interested in it, and do I think that was the basis for the divorce.</sentence><sentence id="420">Because she got married again, but -- to the guy that she'd been going with for years, anyway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Did you all know about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="427">Kids always know everything.</sentence><sentence id="428">Kids know everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
