<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: Why don't you tell me how that came about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: About two weeks after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they lined up, had another selection.</sentence><sentence id="1983">They took us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1984">I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away.</sentence><sentence id="1985">The tank top was so short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing.</sentence><sentence id="1986">And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out.</sentence><sentence id="1987">Then something happened, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were not there, and they put us in some temporary <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1988">The following day, they ran another selection.</sentence><sentence id="1989">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1990">This was the time I really don't know if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> or not because this is the only time and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I remember, we went through the main camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because we were in and this was, I saw the red <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, the permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1991">I saw the band playing.</sentence><sentence id="1992">So, I had a feeling they had some other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> proper which they loaded us.</sentence><sentence id="1993">They unloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> somewhere else, and they put us there.</sentence><sentence id="1994">They put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1995">They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese.</sentence><sentence id="1996">There was one water bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1997">I think we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped somewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute the water.</sentence><sentence id="1998">Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip.</sentence><sentence id="1999">One woman got so frenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe.</sentence><sentence id="2000">When they give us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles.</sentence><sentence id="2001">One was white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin, significant later, I'll tell you about that story.</sentence><sentence id="2002">We stayed, and as I said the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was on and off and on and off.</sentence><sentence id="2003">At night it would stop.</sentence><sentence id="2004">I remember once we were next <span class="NPIP">side</span> there were real cattle making cattle noises.</sentence><sentence id="2005">This was an absolute nightmare.</sentence><sentence id="2006">Later on when I had my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head.</sentence><sentence id="2007">That's all I could hear is that.</sentence><sentence id="2008">It took me years before I wanted to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was very reluctant to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2009">We finally arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> about maybe the third day.</sentence><sentence id="2010">All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2011">We saw someone tried to 7 climb up.</sentence><sentence id="2012">We could see the bombed out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and we were very happy to see those bombed out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I think it must have been the third day.</sentence><sentence id="2014">We felt that another night on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing.</sentence><sentence id="2015">We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing.</sentence><sentence id="2016">Anyway, they took us, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span>, and until that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2017">They had various camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no camp concentration camp as such.</sentence><sentence id="2018">Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went.</sentence><sentence id="2019">Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2020">She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="2021">We finally got into the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2022">It was a long, long <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2023">The front of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the beginning of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, there was <span class="BUILDING">administration places</span>, there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, there was a little <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> which they could burn two bodies.</sentence><sentence id="2024">But this was done for bodies.</sentence><sentence id="2025">It was never done to use it for killing people.</sentence><sentence id="2026">If people died, they would use it.</sentence><sentence id="2027">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and we put our clothes in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span>, and when we walked out from the other side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, we got the clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2028">They marched us down to the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the very end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and there was this big <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> that could accommodate about 1,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="2029">It was clean.</sentence><sentence id="2030">We all got a blanket each.</sentence><sentence id="2031">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used.</sentence><sentence id="2032">There as a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> in the back right under the <span class="BUILDING">guards tower</span>, big <span class="DLF">pits</span> and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2033">There was a wooden trough with pipe.</sentence><sentence id="2034">We could use the water any time we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2035">They nominated one lady, she was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so they spoke fluently German.</sentence><sentence id="2036">They counted us once a day.</sentence><sentence id="2037">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is located on the , SO it's like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">heather</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2038">At that time there was <span class="DLF">fields</span> in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was just us and the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2039">So, we could sit in the sun.</sentence><sentence id="2040">We could drink when we wanted, we could go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> when we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2041">Even at night, if you wanted to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, -- if the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he heard a movement.</sentence><sentence id="2042">So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2043">When the girls were sitting there, they would just look.</sentence><sentence id="2044">After a while, you lose all inhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look.</sentence><sentence id="2045">That's what we're going to do.</sentence><sentence id="2046">At that time we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest with some first aid things and some pills, some equipment.</sentence><sentence id="2047">Mom became the doctor.</sentence><sentence id="2048">There was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very, very decent guy.</sentence><sentence id="2049">So, one of the first questions he asked me is "How come your head is shaved?"</sentence><sentence id="2050">They couldn't understand that.</sentence><sentence id="2051">There were SS but they had no idea about the horrors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2052">They were just half way decent people in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2053">The food we got was <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2054">Fairly decent soup, we got some kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they had something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd get red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the first few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2055">The next few days they put another <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> up.</sentence><sentence id="2056">We got a big group of 8 Hungarian women another <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> up.</sentence><sentence id="2057">So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>, because there were other groups.</sentence></p></dialogue>

like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2649">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something.</sentence><sentence id="2650">We also had babies.</sentence><sentence id="2651">There were babies born.</sentence><sentence id="2652">We had one woman once who knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our

over there and he said this is <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Jordan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2657">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2900">Q: The dead people, they just dumped them <span class="NPIP">outside</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2902">A: That I'll tell you.</sentence><sentence id="2903">When we first came in there was a little morgue not far from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2904">A little concrete structure.</sentence><sentence id="2905">Well we started taking the people out.</sentence><sentence id="2906">Everybody was taking them out.</sentence><sentence id="2907">Well, after a while that <span class="NPIP">place</span> would not accommodate the bodies and they didn't have time to take them.</sentence><sentence id="2908">It got to a point that it was like a tremendous <span class="DLF">field</span> of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw.</sentence><sentence id="2909">Families would walk by and look and who do I know there.</sentence><sentence id="2910">If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save the blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there.</sentence><sentence id="2911">The pile was growing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they had no -- they could not keep up with removing the bodies.</sentence><sentence id="2912">Toward the end when there was this tremendous epidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of privileges.</sentence><sentence id="2913">They would dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and burn the bodies.</sentence><sentence id="2914">They just could not keep up with it.</sentence><sentence id="2915">When the British liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> took the British General, whoever it was, showing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and naturally they avoided that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2916">So, there was a bunch of noisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here.</sentence><sentence id="2917">We didn't speak English, but they said you have to see this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2918">And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and they made the German officers remove those bodies.</sentence><sentence id="2919">They came so beautiful the first day.</sentence><sentence id="2920">They came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had 8 to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were.</sentence><sentence id="2921">Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2922">This was horrid.</sentence><sentence id="2923">Anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was getting bigger.</sentence><sentence id="2924">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> coming in every few days, and they needed help with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2925">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came in, the able bodies would get a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they would place them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved.</sentence><sentence id="2926">A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going.</sentence><sentence id="2927">I have to help them.</sentence><sentence id="2928">I just can't let them work both nights."</sentence><sentence id="2929">So, we went out.</sentence><sentence id="2930">By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed.</sentence><sentence id="2931">There was this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with all kinds of bundles.</sentence><sentence id="2932">They made the people leave the bundles and there were sick people.</sentence><sentence id="2933">Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and find their own clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2934">There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out.</sentence><sentence id="2935">She's half dead, she's dead."</sentence><sentence id="2936">I kept on shoving her around that <span class="NPIP">place</span> behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive.</sentence><sentence id="2937">Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out.</sentence><sentence id="2938">Let's take her out.</sentence><sentence id="2939">Let the guys take her out."</sentence><sentence id="2940">So, I was hiding her behind bundles, behind anything.</sentence><sentence id="2941">Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face.</sentence><sentence id="2942">I tried to give her some water.</sentence><sentence id="2943">Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out.</sentence><sentence id="2944">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was so full of lice.</sentence><sentence id="2945">We got so bitten by lice.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3018">Q: How often did you <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3020">A: We never showered.</sentence><sentence id="3021">The first time when they brought you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3022">This was the second one.</sentence><sentence id="3023">Maybe once they took us out.</sentence><sentence id="3024">I don't remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3034">A: Well, we washed.</sentence><sentence id="3035">Maybe once they took us to <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, maybe when we're changing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, I think they marched us.</sentence><sentence id="3036">This was a pleasure, this <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, and they took our clothes and they deloused them.</sentence><sentence id="3037">Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever.</sentence><sentence id="3038">I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it.</sentence><sentence id="3039">At first they didn't know what was wrong with me.</sentence><sentence id="3040">So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble.</sentence><sentence id="3041">We had a young doctor who was wounded at the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3042">His arm was injured and he was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3043">They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it.</sentence><sentence id="3044">By that time, the doctors in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3045">But I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine.</sentence><sentence id="3046">She had t.b.</sentence><sentence id="3047">but I tried to keep her on calcium.</sentence><sentence id="3048">The theory was that calcium was good for t.b.</sentence><sentence id="3049">and we had calcium, she would get it.</sentence><sentence id="3050">Again, she was a young woman.</sentence><sentence id="3051">You tried to help people who were not too far gone.</sentence><sentence id="3052">We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going.</sentence><sentence id="3053">By that time, the epidemic started.</sentence><sentence id="3054">The typhus epidemic.</sentence><sentence id="3055">It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus.</sentence><sentence id="3056">My fever was building up about three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="3057">It's like with pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="3058">It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis.</sentence><sentence id="3059">Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and bring water and wet my lips.</sentence><sentence id="3060">And those Slovak ladies made me a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3061">I'll never forget it.</sentence><sentence id="3062">This tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3063">They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this.</sentence><sentence id="3064">And I kept on saying "Get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head.</sentence><sentence id="3065">I can't stand the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3066">And when they would bring the turnip soup into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, it was wretched.</sentence><sentence id="3067">I couldn't stand it.</sentence><sentence id="3068">Finally one night, I must have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said "Get me my mother."</sentence><sentence id="3069">So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies.</sentence><sentence id="3070">We had something to support the heart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3071">I think I was dying.</sentence><sentence id="3072">Then I got better.</sentence><sentence id="3073">In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors.</sentence><sentence id="3074">I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick.</sentence><sentence id="3075">This young German doctor performed some surgeries.</sentence><sentence id="3076">Again, he wanted to learn.</sentence><sentence id="3077">He did them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him.</sentence><sentence id="3078">Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it.</sentence><sentence id="3079">Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him.</sentence><sentence id="3080">He didn't know where he was going.</sentence><sentence id="3081">So, they did perform some
