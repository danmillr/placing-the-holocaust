<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="41">4 Interview with Joyce Mizrachi July 23, 2009</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: I don't know how long it took for her to get me back, but I know I must have been about one -- one and a half?</sentence><sentence id="43">One?</sentence><sentence id="44">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="45">I have been trying to get information, but I haven't gotten anything so far.</sentence><sentence id="46">I do have a booklet that was given to my mother when they brought her -- when they brought me to her, and it has the pictures of the women who -- the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red Cross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have.</sentence><sentence id="47">We -- after ri -- Rivesaltes, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tres</span>, and there I have very few memories.</sentence><sentence id="48">The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="49">I think it's my mother.</sentence><sentence id="50">And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem -- that's the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young.</sentence><sentence id="51">And then I do remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tres</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">Not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tres</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, it was the end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">The one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and the air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break open the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">The <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold.</sentence><sentence id="57">And I always cried.</sentence><sentence id="58">So there was a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see.</sentence><sentence id="59">His wife was blind.</sentence><sentence id="60">That I still remember.</sentence><sentence id="61">And he taught me how to -- taught me different songs.</sentence><sentence id="62">And</sentence><sentence id="64">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 that, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else.</sentence><sentence id="65">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="66">And I remember the different things.</sentence><sentence id="67">I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people.</sentence><sentence id="68">And I never had what my sister and brother had.</sentence><sentence id="69">I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry.</sentence><sentence id="70">I was frightened because no matter how young you are, people's emotions do -- do penetrate, and fear is very, very noticeable and affective.</sentence><sentence id="71">It affects you.</sentence><sentence id="72">So I was always frightened of that.</sentence><sentence id="73">I was always afraid of being taken away.</sentence><sentence id="74">The other thing I remember is that I guess it was -- it was a big Catholic organization, and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the nuns had very big headdresses.</sentence><sentence id="75">I don't know the order, but I remember we used to get hot chocolate there, or something like it.</sentence><sentence id="76">And my mother -- I was so s -- very afraid of my mother leaving me, and being very -- screaming very badly.</sentence><sentence id="77">Those are the things I remember, being very frightened.</sentence><sentence id="78">So remember being in back of a woman, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> was a very, very rough <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, at that time especially, because it was near the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">And walking -- and we were walking behind a couple, and she had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off.</sentence><sentence id="80">And she stood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind.</sentence><sentence id="81">I don't know if my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody who was -- had to be caught.</sentence><sentence id="82">And that always, always stuck in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="83">There was a couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way.</sentence><sentence id="84">It was a friend of</sentence><sentence id="86">" Interview with Joyce Mizrachi July 23, 2009 theirs, I-- I don't know, they just figured my mother had two children and they had none, and times were very bad.</sentence><sentence id="87">And she said, probably, I don't know who they were.</sentence><sentence id="88">I know my friend -- friends of ours that still live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> told Lucie about it when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">I don't know who it was, someday I'll go, in the near future, because they're rather old, and I have to go and see what they know.</sentence><sentence id="90">Then I remember coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> after the war, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">Things were very tough in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="92">Work was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="93">The anti-Semitism was horrible, very, very strong.</sentence><sentence id="94">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span>, but because I was very rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn't care less, and I didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="95">There was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they were going to be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, eventually, or some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, or stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">And that made me very frightened.</sentence><sentence id="97">And ultimately my mother was asked to find another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me, because I was such a wonderful child.</sentence><sentence id="98">They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out.</sentence><sentence id="99">And the next <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to was an all-girls school.</sentence><sentence id="100">It was not a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, it was very -- it was mixed.</sentence><sentence id="101">Very few Jews, and I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="102">And the antisis -- anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it's a shame that they didn't get you too.</sentence><sentence id="103">And I didn't know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="104">My father never spoke</sentence><sentence id="106">4 Interview with Joyce Mizrachi July 23, 2009 about it til the day he died, til he had Alzheimer's, then he went back through everything.</sentence><sentence id="107">So he never spoke about anything.</sentence><sentence id="108">But I never understood what she was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="109">It was -- it was tough.</sentence><sentence id="110">Then we came and what we did for entertainment was we went to the movies.</sentence><sentence id="111">And I decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway -- I used to put on accents -- I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh.</sentence><sentence id="112">So I entertained.</sentence><sentence id="113">And coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> meant that I wanted to know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="114">I was nine on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and it was -- I was thrilled.</sentence><sentence id="115">I was thrilled to come, til I came and I didn't particularly care for it.</sentence><sentence id="116">I was very homesick, I missed my friends.</sentence><sentence id="117">My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="118">It was all kept very quietly.</sentence><sentence id="119">We came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">My mother refused.</sentence><sentence id="121">She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice.</sentence><sentence id="122">He either could come -- because she had one sister left, that lived here -- he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th -- he could go and he'd never see us again.</sentence><sentence id="123">So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn't really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">She loved it.</sentence><sentence id="125">And every day I thank her.</sentence><sentence id="126">She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever spoke about it.</sentence><sentence id="127">I never knew he was in the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="128">I never knew that he had</sentence><sentence id="130">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 gotten people out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because he was a plumber, and he knew the underground works, where he had to fix things, and that's how he got people out.</sentence><sentence id="131">I never knew all these things.</sentence><sentence id="132">Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a wonderful father.</sentence><sentence id="133">He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to play with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us.</sentence><sentence id="134">She -- my mother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma -- young.</sentence><sentence id="135">I remember her crying a lot.</sentence><sentence id="136">I remember her when her niece's birthday and her nephews, or whoever, always having -- we didn't have very much money, but she always managed to get flowers next to their picture.</sentence><sentence id="137">And I always think -- I always thought, I don't get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="138">Why do they?</sentence><sentence id="139">I always had a feeling -- well, it's my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you -- she got me out when I was one or two, how did she know it was me?</sentence><sentence id="140">Who told her it was me?</sentence><sentence id="141">Children change.</sentence><sentence id="142">How did she know?</sentence><sentence id="143">We stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">HIAS</span> when we came, and that was really a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">It was a lot of different people from a lot of different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and it was very much like a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>, today, I would imagine.</sentence><sentence id="145">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">And my aunt felt that that really wasn't proper for me, and I stayed with her.</sentence><sentence id="147">And I was -- as I said, I was always very -- my sister and brother do not want to think that I experienced anything.</sentence><sentence id="148">If I say I remember something, they're very fast to either say,</sentence><sentence id="150">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 no you can't, you're too young.</sentence><sentence id="151">They -- it's a form of protecting me, but it's the way they were.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Excuse me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different.</sentence><sentence id="275">And I thought, oh, what a different <span class="NPIP">place</span>, what a different world.</sentence><sentence id="276">But I soon -- and then we moved to <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">But there were always things lingering, there was always this heaviness that I remember.</sentence><sentence id="278">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, there were a lot of -- which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span>, there were a lot of refugees there, and it's funny how you click.</sentence><sentence id="279">And that's what you do.</sentence><sentence id="280">Even later on you do.</sentence><sentence id="281">And the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that that was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle.</sentence><sentence id="282">She was put up as a child.</sentence><sentence id="283">And that reinforced my feeling that, oh I-- I know she's not my mother.</sentence><sentence id="284">And I remember thinking -- and I know, because I was such a difficult child.</sentence><sentence id="285">I was difficult also because she was 43 when she had me.</sentence><sentence id="286">I was not exactly what you call a planned child.</sentence><sentence id="287">And I remember thinking, yeah, if I'm gonna have a kid, I'm gonna have somebody like you.</sentence><sentence id="288">Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I look just like her.</sentence><sentence id="289">But that could be with adopted child as well.</sentence><sentence id="290">I am ju--I am very</sentence><sentence id="292">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi deg July 23, 2009 much like her, and I know, I know that who -- that I'm not.</sentence><sentence id="293">Not that it would matter anyway, after a certain age.</sentence><sentence id="294">As a mother she was a fantastic mother.</sentence><sentence id="295">She let me live and be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of -- who are survive -- children of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="296">Because they burden -- there is a burden on you.</sentence><sentence id="297">There is a--a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too much, because they were upset enough.</sentence><sentence id="298">But all in all they were -- she really did a phenomenal job.</sentence><sentence id="299">She is the reason why we're alive.</sentence><sentence id="300">She is the one who masterminded everything.</sentence><sentence id="301">But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was stopped by Gestapo, and she was -- and he looked at her and he said, I will let you go this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive.</sentence><sentence id="302">So things like that did happen.</sentence><sentence id="303">She did not -- one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for anything that happened before.</sentence><sentence id="304">And that I'm thrilled about, because I do have friends that are everything different.</sentence><sentence id="305">As I said, she didn't put all the ugliness on me, but unfortunately we do that ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="306">I don't -- I'm very careful who I speak to about it.</sentence><sentence id="307">I don't watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="308">And you get your own things that you have to live through and work through, but I didn't have the hardship that they had.</sentence><sentence id="309">For that, I'm lucky too.</sentence><sentence id="310">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="311">And that's my story.</sentence><sentence id="314">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi " July 23, 2009</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: Of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Can you tell me one of the things you -- what your career was, what -- what you did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician like my sister, because my mother wanted me to do that.</sentence><sentence id="367">But when I -- as soon as I made a little money, I went to tech -- I went -- decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along.</sentence><sentence id="368">So I went to -- had a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him?Anthony Menino?</sentence><sentence id="369">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">Herbert Berghof studios</span>, and I studied with Bill Hickey(ph).</sentence><sentence id="370">And I did plays.</sentence><sentence id="371">I did different things, nothing major.</sentence><sentence id="372">Then I got married and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them, which was stupid.</sentence><sentence id="373">But I also didn't have the need that I had before.</sentence><sentence id="374">I'm sorry I didn't pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did.</sentence><sentence id="375">My brother, I remember telling my father, you have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="376">She can't go to <span class="BUILDING">acting school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">You know what's in <span class="BUILDING">acting schools</span>, they're all sick.</sentence><sentence id="378">And a few other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">And my father smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want.</sentence><sentence id="380">And I did, and it was wonderful, I loved it.</sentence><sentence id="381">I really enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="382">And I always said someday I'll do it</sentence><sentence id="384">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi " July 23, 2009 again, and I just -- I've done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="385">That's my fault, no one stopped me except me.</sentence><sentence id="386">But I found that it's a great thing to do, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable.</sentence><sentence id="387">I used to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="388">The only thing that I remember that really I'm thrilled about, when my father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, when he was -- had Alzheimer's, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you know who I am?</sentence><sentence id="389">And he said yes -- and this didn't happen very often -- you're my child.</sentence><sentence id="390">I remember how you -- and I-- I remember all the accents you used to do.</sentence><sentence id="391">And one of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="392">So it was an imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny.</sentence><sentence id="393">And strange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his shoes, because he'd have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide.</sentence><sentence id="394">But that was -- you know, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and there is some nice things that you can remember.</sentence><sentence id="395">For the longest time I couldn't think of my father because I didn't want to think of him that way.</sentence><sentence id="396">Took a long time, and now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer <span class="NPIP">parts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">For someone who did so much good, sad to think that that had to happen.</sentence><sentence id="398">But, you know, we're not privileged.</sentence><sentence id="399">The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in <span class="REGION">California</span> who was really -- who's like my third cousin or second cousin.</sentence><sentence id="400">And she</sentence><sentence id="402">Interview with Joyce Mizrachi " July 23, 2009 knew all about his grandmother and his -- and my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="403">I had no idea about them.</sentence><sentence id="404">I had no idea about anything.</sentence><sentence id="405">I found out that my great-grandmother had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure.</sentence><sentence id="406">But I never knew all these things.</sentence><sentence id="407">I never knew anything.</sentence><sentence id="408">It's almost like being adopted, when you don't know who your grandparents are really.</sentence><sentence id="409">You don't know -- you don't have any aunts and uncles, you don't have any cousins.</sentence><sentence id="410">There's no one there.</sentence><sentence id="411">The reason we're so close is because that's it, that was what we had.</sentence><sentence id="412">That's who we had to rely on, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="413">There was no one else.</sentence><sentence id="414">And then we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I had an aunt, and she had -- but her children were much older than -- because she was my mother's oldest sister.</sentence><sentence id="415">And she decided that we were too European, she really didn't want too much of us.</sentence><sentence id="416">She was a little mentally deranged.</sentence><sentence id="417">And we didn't see her that much.</sentence><sentence id="418">So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very large family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always had cousins and friends and -- and the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="419">And it was lovely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
