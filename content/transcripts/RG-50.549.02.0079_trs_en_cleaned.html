money.</sentence><sentence id="180">And how was this</sentence></p><p><sentence id="183"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0079 5 going to be, you know, they have to support another person.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and I needed a bit of money for -- for tuition and for travel, because I -- they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montre</span> and I had to travel to <span class="BUILDING">University of Lausanne</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">And they were able to get a little scholarship for me from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">But it was a very close community.</sentence><sentence id="187">And what she found, and I'm telling you what she says to me, what she found that -- that I became her best friend.</sentence><sentence id="188">Because at that point I was 19 and she was 30 some -- could figure out how old she was, but I can't remember it now.</sentence><sentence id="189">Anyway -- and when she found out that I had met my husband -- I mean my future husband on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and when the letters arrived, she went through that courtship with me, and almost sort of vicariously lived through that.</sentence><sentence id="190">And so when the day came of the -- of the wa -- I mean, she remembers in detail what I said to her about, you know, when he proposed and -- and you know, where she was sitting.</sentence><sentence id="191">She was sitting in the -- she was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, cleaning something and I came and -- and told her and just exactly what I told her, you know, and so it was like a big thing for her, bigger than it was for me.</sentence><sentence id="192">I was like, yeah, I'm getting married.</sentence><sentence id="193">Sort of a crazy 19 year old, 20 year old --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: -- by that point.</sentence><sentence id="196">So that I think, you know, she remembers in detail about -- and tells me all over again about, you know, my going to -- to get Dan at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, you know, wearing a -- a two piece blue dress with, you know, that was -- that was perfectly ironed and my nails were perfectly done, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="197">And</sentence><sentence id="199">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0079 deg it's funny because -- and of course, I think I told on the other tape that one of the -- anyhow, I don't know, that -- that one of the nice things that my uncle had done for me is that before Dan came and I met him again, my uncle said, you know, the wedding is all arranged for, which was fine with me, I hadn't do -- done very much about that.</sentence><sentence id="200">And -- but you have not -- you know, you think you want to get married, but if something doesn't go right, you have two weeks and if you want to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: That was very great of him to say and I appreciated it then and I appreciate it more as I am an adult and have children of my own.</sentence><sentence id="213">But he did say that, and so I have that in the background, so I was feeling fairly safe and okay.</sentence><sentence id="214">And now, as an adult I look back and everybody says, my God, what a risk, you know, all of this thing was.</sentence><sentence id="215">But it didn't seen to me that way at all.</sentence><sentence id="216">I mean, you know, you marry -- you meet somebody, you like them, and you just get married.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Did you have a sense of -- this was more than 10 years after the end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: But did it have a sense for you because of all your aunts and uncles being there who had survived, and even though you were a child then, did it have any sense of continuance, and we -- of surviving, people having survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="227">Was there that</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Maybe because -- because it was late -- so much later and because I was so young when I lost my parents.</sentence><sentence id="247">And I lived with my uncle -- my -- my mother's sister's husband, whom I adored and he adored me.</sentence><sentence id="248">And you know, I star -- I started my life with him when I was, you know, in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">So -- so I was in -- it-it -- it was, in a way, contrary to that i-in -- in a sense that he wasn't going to be able to be at my wedding.</sentence><sentence id="250">So in a way, I -- I her -- I felt the absence of a parent, but not my real parents, because it was so far in the background.</sentence><sentence id="251">I mean, I know that that is how my uncle and my aunt felt, and -- and to my uncle it was extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="252">That's why, you know, my aunt tells me that to my uncle -- and he had told me -- he passed away in "90, but he told me how important it was to him that -- that there was this continuation and th -- it was extremely important to them that I marry someone who is Jewish and that was behind their inviting me, much -- very much so.</sentence><sentence id="253">And that was said to me.</sentence><sentence id="254">You know, they wanted me to -- to meet people because they knew at -- my aunt says that she knew that -- he knew that if I was left in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> I wouldn't</sentence><sentence id="256"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0079 n marry somebody Jewish and that would be the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="257">There was just nobody to meet there.</sentence><sentence id="258">And they thought I would meet someone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montre</span>, through them.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I met people, but I had pre-empted it all by meeting Dan on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">So -- so it was extremely important to them, it was -- it was for them, because they were that generation to -- who understood it.</sentence><sentence id="261">I ha -- I-I don't think I understood it fully.</sentence></p></dialogue>
