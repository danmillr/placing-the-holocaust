<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">intellectually driven person with a -- a constant thirst for a-acquiring new knowledge and reconsidering and re-evaluating things in her life, both the significant and the trivial on a day to day basis, but her mind is constantly focused on that sort on of endeavor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: I guess my -- my question was sort of trying to first of all get you back into childhood, but also trying to bring out whether or not your perception of your parents has changed over the years [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Oh, I can answer, I do -- I do not think that my perception of them has changed over the years.</sentence><sentence id="6">I think that w -- the one thing one can say about each of my parents, even my father, who is American, and brings with that certain cultural baggage, is that they don't -- th-they don't move with -- with the changes and ebbs and flows of American society.</sentence><sentence id="7">They've been very consistent in their own personality types throughout my life.</sentence><sentence id="8">And the things that they were concerned with or dedicated to at the time of my birth, a-and mine and my brother's upbringing continue to this day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="13">They -- they behave and -- and dress actually, very much in the ways that I recall them having done so when I was a child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Interesting.</sentence><sentence id="16">Talk about your brother a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="17">Who is -- what's his name, when</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">Interview with Harry Gelb , December 13, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: -- when he was born, and -- and what -- what type is he?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="22">My brother's name is Paul Gelb.</sentence><sentence id="23">Right now he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span>, but obviously he lived here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with our family when he grew up.</sentence><sentence id="24">He was born April 13" of 1960, also here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, which makes him four years younger than me.</sentence><sentence id="25">And I remember very well the time when he was born, and having been sent for a -- a sleepover to a friend's, while my mother gave birth to Paul.</sentence><sentence id="26">I remember him coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and having a -- a reasonably good memory myself, I recall details of our upbringing very, very well since the day he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because that was his fourth birthday and my memory goes back even farther than that.</sentence><sentence id="27">And is there anything in particular you'd like to know about him?The way he looks, what his interests are?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: Describe him -- just describe him a little bit to us.</sentence><sentence id="37">Sort of as -- over -- against how you think you are, how you see yourself, maybe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Physically my brother, i-it's obvious to anyone who would see us, is -- is -- he's a very -- looks very different.</sentence><sentence id="41">I am about six feet tall, weigh about 155 pounds, I'm a very thin -- thin framed person.</sentence><sentence id="42">And my brother is about six feet five inches tall, is physically built -- the only way I can describe him, as I've often said, is that he looks like, literally like the statue of a Greek god.</sentence><sentence id="43">He works with his body, meaning he's a landscaper and he designs things and works with things <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>, heavy</sentence><sentence id="45">things, all day.</sentence><sentence id="46">And I'm sure in large part because of this, he's able to keep up the tremendous physique that he has.</sentence><sentence id="47">But he's always been a very physical person.</sentence><sentence id="48">I've been a very much more intellectually oriented, and my brother has always been oriented towards sports, the great outdoors, and using his body and keeping it moving and doing things at all times.</sentence><sentence id="49">Very different type of person from me.</sentence><sentence id="50">We had very similar education though, we went to the same <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span>, the same <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> and the same <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">And we went to similar <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">We went from <span class="BUILDING">PS 187</span> to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> 143, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper Manhattan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">Then each of us went to the Bronx High School of Science.</sentence><sentence id="54">And then I went on to <span class="BUILDING">Hamilton College</span>, and four years later, Paul went on to <span class="BUILDING">Saint Lawrence University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Both of those are smaller, upstate New York institutions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Did you get along when you were small?</sentence><sentence id="75">Were you kind of friends, did you sh -- did you share things, or was it difficult because you were so -- such different people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: I think actually we got along very well.</sentence><sentence id="79">There's always sibling rivalry, and any pair of brothers who are four years apart who say that they don't have periodic, or sometimes unrelenting battles between the two of them would be prevaricating.</sentence><sentence id="80">I'll -- Pll just say that we -- we got along just fine.</sentence><sentence id="81">He, because of his great physical abilities was often welcomed in with my circle of friends, almost as a co-equal, so</sentence><sentence id="83">that he could so-called hang with them, and play sports with them, and they looked at him very much as one of their own friends.</sentence><sentence id="84">I'm sure that he -- that being welcomed by -- by my friends made his life a little more easy, or fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: It's a -- it's a good chance, actually, to go back into your childhood, because you said your memory goes back so far.</sentence><sentence id="94">I'm -- my own does, too, which is interesting, it does in -- sort of in glimpses.</sentence><sentence id="95">Put -- give us those glimpses that you remem -- give us a few, sort of impressions from what you remember, what it was like in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, what -- what do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Hm.</sentence><sentence id="100">Well, I rem -- first of all, looking at our general family constellation, some of the most interesting and fun things that -- that we did, meaning Paul and I did as children, was to go and visit our relatives.</sentence><sentence id="101">My mother's family, each -- she has two older sisters, one sister lived with her family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, the other sister lived with her family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">And travels out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, to different <span class="BUILDING">venues</span> are always interesting to any child.</sentence><sentence id="103">What was very unique -- visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>, of course, is a foreign country, but I don't think there is anything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> that particularly grabbed our attention when compared to our lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, except that it was always fun to see our cousins and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="104">Going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> was very interesting because at that time, our aunt and her husband, our uncle lived on and owned a <span class="DLF">chicken egg farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">And they had dogs and</sentence><sentence id="107">rabbits and people who worked there.</sentence><sentence id="108">And imagine coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> and then all of a sudden being allowed to play in -- in a wide open <span class="DLF">farm</span> with your cousins who took you around and showed you all of these things that you'd never been exposed to before.</sentence><sentence id="109">You had the run of the <span class="REGION">land</span>, you had the run of the animals, you had the run of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">It was really a big adventure.</sentence><sentence id="111">We also had a paternal grandmother, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Asbury Park</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, very, very close to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">So when we visited there it was always pleasant for my mother to take us over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">It was only about four or five blocks directly to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and we could go on the little rides, and -- and get a salt water taffy, and orange-ade, and waffles with ice cream and hang out on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>, and if the weather is right we could even go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">But we could go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> any time of the year, as long as it was clement weather.</sentence><sentence id="115">That was always a fun thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="116">My brother and I had free run of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span>, that's near 190(tm) Street and <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">In those days -- and these days as well, but in those days it was a very, very safe, and the children could wander the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> freely, enjoying everything from the <span class="BUILDING">Cloisters Museum</span> in <span class="DLF">Fort Tryon Park</span>, all the way through playing ball in the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> as most children would do.</sentence><sentence id="118">So we had quite a range of things to keep us busy in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119"><span class="DLF">Fort Tryon Park</span> in</sentence><sentence id="121">particular providing a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where a lot of different sorts of recreations and adventures could be had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Do you recall -- before I -- we talk a little bit more about what it was like at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> atmosphere and so on, do you remember the particular circumstance or event or so when you first realized, understood, that your mother was what we now call a Holocaust s -- a Holocaust survivor?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: There was never a time that I can recall that I was not aware that she and her sisters were Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="149">As a matter of fact my mother has always made it a point, and I know this not only because she did it, but because she said to me, and has reminded me that she has done so, to be very honest a-a-about her background, and I'm quite certain knowing her, that she told us things in an age appropriate manner, meaning age appropriate as far as we children were concerned.</sentence><sentence id="150">But we have known as -- as long as I can remember, what our roots were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Do you remember partic -- a particular sort of w -- how she talked to you about it, or do you -- its -- an-and your response, your feelings?</sentence><sentence id="155">How do you -- how did you f -- how did you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Well --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: What -- what was your response to it?</sentence><sentence id="160">Sort of, curiosity, fear, anger, resentment, what sort of happened?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Speaking for myself, I -- I -- then, and now, my reaction is always curiosity and further curiosity.</sentence><sentence id="165">I in no way ever resented this.</sentence><sentence id="166">As a matter of fact, since so many o-of my mother's relatives, and -- and of course her extended circle of friends were survivors as well, this was not something that seemed in any way aberrational or different.</sentence><sentence id="167">This was just something that I accepted as the norm, that some of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I lived in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span>, had come over after World War II as survivors, as compared to the many, many other, particularly German Jews who settled along <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> in the late 1920's and 1930's, before the war.</sentence><sentence id="168">Many of the children in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were the descendants of that group of people, as well, but basically those are the types of people that lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where Paul and I grew up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Did you perceive any differences that might be attributed to Holocaust experiences among your aunt as over -- against your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Well, I think i-it's -- they're -- both aunts, and you have to remember that my mother, a-as you might know is the youngest of three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="177">My -- when the war broke out, as my mother was born in December of 1929, and the war broke out in September of 1939, my mother had not even celebrated her 10" birthday.</sentence><sentence id="178">So her outlook on the war, both then and now, i-in retrospect, is I'm certain quite, quite different from that, let's say, of her oldest sister, who is significantly older than she.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="182">Interview with Harry Gelb me December 13, 2001 My -- my mother's oldest sister, if I'm correct, ha -- was already attending <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, and my mother would have just been a <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> child at the time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="183">So the -- the -- how do we say, perspective that -- that a -- a child who's 10 years old would have on the outbreak of war is certainly different than a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> child would have.</sentence><sentence id="184">My -- I-I -- I'm sorry, I just -- I was wondering what it -- exactly it was that you'd like me to get at, because it's such a -- a broad <span class="REGION">area</span>, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Well, I was just -- we can -- can leave that alone and bring it up later --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Just go right ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: -- and talk more about it, but I was kind of thinking, because of the a -- wh- whether you saw, as a -- this, still trying to be in your childhood somewhere, it's kind of hard to [indecipherable] --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: No, no, I understand --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: -- separately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: -- but you were asking about my mother and her sisters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Yeah, whether you perceived certain differences.</sentence><sentence id="195">The way they were, or the way they talked, or what they talked about, what they didn't talk about --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: -- that could be attributed to experiences in the -- during the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: I think that the amount of -- of discussion that any o -- that either or -- of her sisters, and compared to my mother, that any of the three girls had about Holocaust activity, or what ha-had happened to them, I mean, in the Holocaust, is more reflection of their -- just of their basic personality.</sentence><sentence id="204">For example, my oldest -- my mother's oldest sister, my oldest aunt, I was just going to say, is just slightly more reticent, but that's just her -- her -- just innate character.</sentence><sentence id="205">She's always willing to discuss, and always was willing to discuss their past.</sentence><sentence id="206">She married a survivor, and someone that she had known overseas, of course, and she -- he was a -- he was a guerilla fighter, as was the husband that my mother's next oldest sister married.</sentence><sentence id="207">They were all survivors, so within the family, issues of discussing their past are certainly -- were n-nothing to hide, this was part of their joint and several backgrounds.</sentence><sentence id="208">And actually, my father would be the only one who would be viewed or -- I shouldn't he would be -- he could have been, but he wasn't viewed as an outsider, having been born here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and grown up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">It's a -- but my father fit right in with the family, he -- he's just a -- a very gentle and welcoming sort of person and -- and that is reflected in the way that these five other people treated him and accepted him.</sentence><sentence id="210">The sister -- my mother's middle sister, so to speak, the sister that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, and her husband have always been, out of the three sisters, the most involved in Holocaust related activities.</sentence><sentence id="211">As</sentence><sentence id="213">you might know, the sister who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> married a gentleman names Miles Lerman, who eventually became the chairman of the Holocaust Memorial Commission and <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C</span>.. So all of our family has always looked up to Uncle Miles and his activities as exemplars of -- of what one could in reference to remembering or commemorating the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="214">But that doesn't in any way mean that I wish to give short shrift to the concerns and activities, both of his wife and of my mother and her oldest sister, who live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Her name is Hania?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">Her name is Hania Wilson, her -- people call her Anna.</sentence><sentence id="232">And the sister who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> is Krysia, but people call her Chris, their last name is Lerman.</sentence><sentence id="233">And I forgot to say that the uncle that I had, by marriage of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>, who is now deceased, his name was Adash Wilson, but he was known in Can-Canada as Adrian.</sentence><sentence id="234">And the uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, who is the hol -- <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> is Miles Lerman.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Di -- I -- I gather yet that you did get along with your cousins, but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Oh sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: -- speak a little more about that relationship.</sentence><sentence id="243">Is it particularly close or just sort of, and did you talk about, amongst yourself about the experience of your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="249">Interview with Harry Gelb 8 December 13, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: There is -- looking back, there was some discussion about it, but more in latter days, more since the time I would be college age, and in a way that isn't really reflective of how we were raised.</sentence><sentence id="251">Seeing our cousins was basically seeing our cousins and having fun.</sentence><sentence id="252">Of course, visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, those cousins from the oldest sister were a bit older than me and Paul, and I'm sure they looked at us as -- as their nice, very much younger cousins visiting from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">But we were entertained when we visited there, largely by my mother who -- who took us around and made sure that Paul and I had fun things to do.</sentence><sentence id="254">However, when we went down to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, my cousin David, who is the younger of Krysia and Miles's two children, and was a boy as well, and was also involved in boy's scouting, was a hero to me and Paul.</sentence><sentence id="255">He led us through adventures on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and -- and starting little campfires and cooking potatoes and hot dogs and chasing the chickens through the <span class="DLF">coop</span>, and taking fresh eggs [indecipherable] under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nest</span> and just generally having a lot of fun.</sentence><sentence id="256">All of the other three cousins, meaning his older sister and the two cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> are female.</sentence><sentence id="257">So I -- I suppose one could say that Paul and I had a bit of a closer relationship to David at the time we were children.</sentence><sentence id="258">Also, when we were growing up there came a point where David's older sister, since we saw th-this family more often, they were living in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, David's older sister was away at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandeis</span> for four years, and then went to Stanford for <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, so</sentence><sentence id="260">we didn't see her for long periods of time.</sentence><sentence id="261">But David was around a lot when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, and David was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">My first ever college field trip was to visit David up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">That would be in the spring of 1972.</sentence><sentence id="264">And that was a big adventure for me too, it was a big trip away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Okay, let's go back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">That was a good -- and if you want to take a sip of water, you can do that.</sentence><sentence id="283">Yeah, let's go back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see sort of what kind of values were stressed?</sentence><sentence id="284">What -- with regarding t -- with regard to education and religious upbringing and so on.</sentence><sentence id="285">What was important to your parents and what -- what -- what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: With regards to education, I can speak both for my mother and for each of her two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="292">They were extremely devoted to the -- the value of education and a classical education at that.</sentence><sentence id="293">Each of the three sisters a-and their spouses as well, drove all of us cousins, so to speak, to a-achieve academically as much as we possibly could.</sentence><sentence id="294">And virtually all of us have graduate degrees and we all did excessively well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">We went to excellent <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and did well in them.</sentence><sentence id="296">I'm proud to say.</sentence><sentence id="297">Education, though, isn't only what one does in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">My -- my mother, as -- as well as her two sisters exposed the -- their very -- their respective children to all sorts of -- of -- both performing and fine arts, to make sure that we had a -- a breadth of knowledge and familiarity with the -- the humanities, that</sentence><sentence id="300">Interview with Harry Gelb (r) December 13, 2001 would not make us simply narrow academics, but to make us a broader and more fulfilled and self-fulfilling people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Yeah, your mother actually said in her interview that the emphasis as far as she was concerned was not so much on succeeding, but on broadening their horizons.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="314">So you would say that's how you would see that -- how -- how you see that too, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Absolutely, it's both.</sentence><sentence id="316">It isn't just -- ne -- she -- I -- I agree with her, even in her own self estimation.</sentence><sentence id="317">I think that she both was very interested that -- that we succeeded o-on both a substantive level and of course competitively, which don't necessarily go hand in hand.</sentence><sentence id="318">And also that -- that we became more familiar with other cultures and other histories that weren't our own.</sentence><sentence id="319">And I know her two sisters felt exactly the same, because you can see it in -- in the way their children are now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Was that a burden to you sometimes too, that you felt that you had to kind of move on and make her proud, or was it something that just sort of came naturally to you anyway?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: These -- these sorts of things came up, but only when -- I-I'd say when I was over -- over the age of 17 or 18.</sentence><sentence id="439">In other words, after -- I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> early, so after I got out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and people became freer in talking -- or more interested maybe in talking about these things, and I -- I ki -- will tell you later a bit about some of the other people that -- that I knew and the things that we discussed in -- in those years.</sentence><sentence id="440">But as a child, this is not something the -- that the children used as a -- as a conversation item between them.</sentence><sentence id="441">Now, you were asking about -- about how I view education.</sentence><sentence id="442">When I went to the Bronx High School of Science, you can imagine that like me there were many other children of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="443">And of course in those days, Bronx Science was heavily</sentence><sentence id="445">Jewish as a general matter, whether that be American Jews or Jews from other parts of the world, and not necessarily Holocaust survivors, per se.</sentence><sentence id="446">Then, at that point there was no formal Holocaust education class or program at <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Science</span>, although I distinctly recall that these issues were discussed in social studies classes as -- as one would expect them to be, in the context of studying history.</sentence><sentence id="447">However, shortly after I left, the Bronx High School of Science opened what I believe was the first <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> Holocaust study center of its kind in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and it's there to this day.</sentence><sentence id="448">I actually happened to stop by <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Science</span> last week cause I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> on business, to see one of my old history, or social studies teachers.</sentence><sentence id="449">And indeed, the <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is -- we actually mentioned it, the <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is still there, and the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, though, has changed, and what -- what is wonderful about having the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust center</span> there now is that the student body is made up of children who might not know as much as we did when we were children, the reason being that Bronx Science, like Stuyvesant and <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn Tech</span> is now heavily Asian.</sentence><sentence id="450">And overall one could say that whereas the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was largely Jewish when I went there -- of course, there were -- there were hundreds and hundreds of other children from other backgrounds, whether they be -- were Protestants or Catholic, Irish or Greek or -- or -- or black Americans or Spanish.</sentence><sentence id="451">Now, the vast proportion, maybe not the majority, but a vast proportion of the students hail from Asia.</sentence><sentence id="452">And</sentence><sentence id="454">you can see that the minute you enter these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">It -- this is just reflective, in many ways, of the changing ethnic face of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">And it's a wonderful thing to know that this <span class="BUILDING">center</span> is serving these children's educational needs.</sentence></p></dialogue>

education.</sentence><sentence id="488">One of the most interesting aspects of -- of -- of my outlook, and the counsel that I give to my children and others nowadays, is -- is my mother's attitude about going on to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="489">I think it was a given with every family in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that their

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fordham</span>.</sentence><sentence id="496">You can rest assured, I'm sure she would have been quite proud and supportive.</sentence><sentence id="497">However, from the earliest years my -- my mother encouraged me and Paul to think about going away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="498">And why was this?</sentence><sentence id="499">She was v-very o- open about why this was.</sentence><sentence id="500">When my mother came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, she came under the supervision and the guardianship of her next oldest sister, which is Krysia, and Krysia's new husband Miles.</sentence><sentence id="501">And when they first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they lived together as a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, and then Krysia gave birth to my cousin Jeanette, and my mother was involved in raising her.</sentence><sentence id="502">And then there came a point in time, the exact date I don't recall, but that's not really relevant, when Miles and Krysia decided to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, and my mother was to stay on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and attend <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="503">She had attended Thomas Jefferson High

class="REGION">Indiana</span></sentence><sentence id="507">Interview with Harry Gelb 4 December 13, 2001 was or even perhaps where it was.</sentence><sentence id="508">But the offer included the opportunity to both teach and to finish her undergraduate education, at I -- I -- I'm certain a -- a financially acceptable situation for her, given the fact that she was basically on her

in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span>.</sentence><sentence id="511">The point of what I'm saying is specifically that she always told us how important it was in her upbringing, to be exposed to a different cultural and intellectual milieu, while she was in <span class="REGION">Indiana</span>, from the one she would have been exposed to had she stayed here and attended <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> and finish her education there.</sentence><sentence id="512">And -- although of course, immediately after graduating from <span class="BUILDING">Indiana University</span>, she did indeed move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, she always told us and still does to this day, how highly she valued the years that she spent there.</sentence><sentence id="513">Both the fact that she ha -- got a wonderful education, but also because she met so many different types of people from so many different

class="REGION">middle America</span>, that she would never have seen here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> during those years.</sentence><sentence id="515">And I suppose that that in large part informed the way she counseled me and Paul about the -- maybe not advisability but about the weight we should give in -- in thinking of out of town schools.</sentence><sentence id="516">And you'll notice that both Paul and I went off to out of town <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">And the end of my four years at</sentence><sentence id="519">Interview with Harry Gelb 6 December 13, 2001 Hamilton, I did move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, but I moved back here at that point largely because the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> that had selected me, which was <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span> was a fine institution.</sentence><sentence id="520">If one, for example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, had accepted me that I wanted to attend, I would have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, and perhaps eventually relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="521">As a matter of fact, now that I think back on it, I probably would have.</sentence><sentence id="522">But it wa -- the selection

to talk about things, or with someone who is more reticent.</sentence><sentence id="993">If you're asking about the historical developments that I was exposed to as a child, as a general matter, I would be happy to answer your question.</sentence><sentence id="994">I think that the desegregation movement of the 1960's, which was in large part sparked by educational desegregation decision by the Supreme Court in Brown versus Board of Ed.,</sentence><sentence id="995">in 1954, I believe, just before I was born, but not implemented until the re -- tru -- not implemented it really in fact and in detail until al -- the great society, Lyndon Johnston administration, really, really affected me strongly as to my sense of -- of equality, for opportunity for all people.</sentence><sentence id="996">I was highly, highly upset at the -- at Martin Luther King's death, much more so than at Robert Kennedy's death, which we -- they were both in the same season, I mean, I remember them both well.</sentence><sentence id="997">I think the reason for this was th-that I, even as a child, and I would have just been 12 years old then, viewed Martin Luther King as -- as a champion of -- well, obviously he was a champion of civil rights, but I mean a -- a champion of rights without being a revolutionary.</sentence><sentence id="998">And in a way that was more inclusive and less divisive than many other people would have been in seeking the same overall goals.</sentence><sentence id="999">What I think was interesting in my outlook at -- at least wh-when I look back as --</sentence><sentence id="1001">Interview with Harry Gelb 8 December 13, 2001 as a sort of revisionist, now, is that the desegregation movement of -- of the 60's, in -- in particular Martin Luther King's work, begat a lot of equal opportunity, equal employment opportunity and other e-equal housing opportunity, equal health opportunity, equal educational opportunity movements in the 60's.</sentence><sentence id="1002">The desegregation of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> I agreed with and I still do to this day, wholeheartedly.</sentence><sentence id="1003">But I think that in affirmative action on the job, and in -- and in recruitment for -- for higher education, I think -- I thought then that it was perhaps a necessary thing, but I'm coming to think now, after it's been a good 40 years of such programs, that perhaps the time has come as a matter of -- of social justice and to be more inclusive of all other types of peoples who've come here in the years since the 60's and have re-colored, both literally and figuratively the face of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in particular, that opportunity be based on merit and achievement, rather than on a blind consideration of a person's color or ethnic or religious background.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And I say this even as a person who is the child of a survivor who was offered opportunities when she came here.</sentence><sentence id="1005">I think what is different is that even children of survivors -- I shouldn't say children, even -- even we children of survivors who have parents who came here, saw that these parents, many of whom came over without education, without any bul -- physical belongings, without any money.</sentence><sentence id="1006">Literally with just a carry-on bag in their hands, and a -- as they say, a hope in their</sentence><sentence id="1008">44 Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 hearts, were able to educate themselves, make careers, make families and raise those families and support themselves, while there are many others in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, who -- nowadays, who one can say have equal opportunity, but it is my view, independently choose, and willingly in -- choose to not exercise those opportunities in -- wi-with even one-tenth the drive or ambition that the Holocaust survivors did a mere 50 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1009">I think that's a -- a very, very important comparison and in some ways drives my changing outlook on affirmative action.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Because I feel that there are just so many immigrants who come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> now who are willing to work hard for themselves, as did our parents, that they all have the equal opportunity to do the same sorts of things that our parents did for themselves and their families.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And I -- I really don't feel at this point, that the government should be requiring as a matter of law, or -- or monetarily subsidizing those who a-are not willing to exercise the rights and opportunities available to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1125">A: Yes, in-indeed, I-I think our greatest hope is -- is that our children would grow up to be both literate and concerned beings.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Aside from formal education, which [ll discuss in a minute, I think a very unique portion of -- of Max's upbringing, meaning our older son's upbringing was the fact that during his formative years, Cheryl] was a senior staff member at New York City ballet.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And at that time we lived directly across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, literally a 15 second commute from her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the New York State Theater at <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln Center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Max grew up basically as the New York City Ballet Company mascot.</sentence><sentence id="1129">He and I were there every day because my wife worked evenings and we would go to say hello to her, but not only to her, to all of her staff members and to the many members of the orchestra, and the dance company, with whom we became friends over the years.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And she was there from 1985 to "95, and Max was born, as I said, in January of "89.</sentence><sentence id="1131">So he had his first six years at the <span class="BUILDING">ballet</span>, backstage, in the <span class="DLF">orchestra pit</span>, in the flies, playing hockey in the</sentence><sentence id="1133">Interview with Harry Gelb %8 December 13, 2001 <span class="INT_SPACE">back hallways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1134">Hanging out at the <span class="BUILDING">dance bar</span> and making believe he was -- he was a little nutcracker prince with some of the world famous prima ballerinas.</sentence><sentence id="1135">It was a most unusual thing for a child to be exposed to this quantity of the performing arts on a day to day basis.</sentence><sentence id="1136">The funny thing is that nowadays he enjoys going to these things very much, and is even actually -- last night he said to me, hey Dad, we've gotta go see The Nutcracker.</sentence><sentence id="1137">Because that's -- that's a performance that he adored as a child.</sentence><sentence id="1138">But he is not willing to perform.</sentence><sentence id="1139">He doesn't feel that he has any talents either in music or in dance.</sentence><sentence id="1140">However, on the other hand, he's a phenomenal athlete and he's discovered in himself talents which I know I never had, and perhaps he inherited somehow from his Uncle Paul.</sentence><sentence id="1141">But my -- my older son is physically gifted, and he plays league sports i-in -- in many different <span class="REGION">areas</span> and is particularly good in the hockey sports.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And he plays league ice hockey, league roller hockey, he's just a -- a phenomenal athlete.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And he's -- he's very proud of himself and he'1l never fail to tell you, I'm -- you know, proud papas tal -- talk this way all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1144">But he -- he"!</sentence><sentence id="1145">remind you of that as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1167">Q: What about the formal education?</sentence><sentence id="1168">He is --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1169">A: Okay, formal education.</sentence><sentence id="1170">When he was in <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>, I suppose you call it, pre-K at the <span class="BUILDING">Westside Montessori school</span>, it was -- it was somewhat apparent to us that he might be a gifted child, and we had him tested, and were fortunate enough to</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1177">find that he's a superlative gif -- superlatively gifted child.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And he was accepted to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> public school program for -- for truly a-advanced children, and I'm no-not -- I'm n-not saying this in -- in any way to make him sound better than other children, it's just a fact that that's -- that's the whole definition of -- of the program he was in, it's called the Anderson program, and it -- and there are two programs like it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, Anderson program on the <span class="REGION">west side</span> and Hunter College high school has its own program which goes all the way down to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> on the <span class="REGION">east side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1179">And so Max went to and attended the Anderson program and he graduated from there after the fifth grade and took an exam to get into another gifted program for <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> level, that's called the Delta program.</sentence><sentence id="1180">And it's -- it's -- basically it's the same kids and others who have joined them in a slightly larger program that he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And he's now in the seventh grade.</sentence><sentence id="1182">He is getting a -- a regular, although accelerated and perhaps a bit more in depth <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> education.</sentence><sentence id="1183">He's doing very, very well, he -- this particular child, it's within his personality to be most competitive.</sentence><sentence id="1184">He is -- I think if I had to descri -- use one word to describe my own -- this particular child, I would say it's competitive.</sentence><sentence id="1185">He has to be a medalist, meaning he has to get the gold, or the silver or the bronze, and he's very happy to get any one of them, although everyone wants the gold, but he's happy to get them.</sentence><sentence id="1186">But no matter</sentence><sentence id="1188">Interview with Harry Gelb *deg December 13, 2001 whether it's in sports, or in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, he has to be a winner, he has to be a medalist.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And that's the way he does in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and that's also the way he does in sports.</sentence><sentence id="1190">So I think it's very interesting that this child has grown to be so highly competitive in personality.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1223">This is a child who really -- this one really loves stories and loves being read to, and loves imagining and loves creating <span class="INT_SPACE">play spaces</span> and games and environments, as you can see from our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, it's -- we're surrounded her by -- by Legos and -- and little -- little seenaria o-of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="DLF">construction sites</span> and -- and letters and he</sentence><sentence id="1225">Interview with Harry Gelb * December 13, 2001 does these things every single day.</sentence><sentence id="1226">Actually Max at that age, although interested in things -- he loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, he loved model <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and he loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that went around, as Joe does, but he wasn't as interested in building these little communities and environments that you see here, as Joe is, and he's -- this is the way Joe is, this is the kind of child he is.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1242">Q: Well, let me rephrase this, I didn't mean how did they relate, I just say, what's the relationship between, how do they like each other, do they -- do they talk -- do- does sh -- does she talk to the oldest one about parts of her past already?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: She does, but he -- it isn't something that they talk with any frequency about.</sentence><sentence id="1245">He is quite aware, prob -- in more so and in more detail about my mother's background than I was about her background at his age.</sentence><sentence id="1246">The reason is that Cheryl and I have always in -- been believers in -- in being very upfront with Max, we're much more open and less protective of him, and -- and eventually of Joseph than my mother was of me and Paul.</sentence><sentence id="1247">My mother was very careful, I'm -- I'm certain, not to traumatize me or Paul with things that she viewed as inappropriate for a given age.</sentence><sentence id="1250">Interview with Harry Gelb * December 13, 2001 And a-as -- as you've interviewed her, I'm sure you can agree that -- that sh-she may have said that to you, or you may have read it into what she said, but I-I'm sure you'd agree with the statement I just made.</sentence><sentence id="1251">On the other hand, perhaps to his detriment, perhaps to his benefit, I don't know, I have been very, very upfront with Max, not only about my mother's background, but about everything that I do at work, about everything in the world, both the good, a -- things and the horrors of living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1252">The sufferings of people, crime, death, disease.</sentence><sentence id="1253">I -- I -- we really don't hide anything from him.</sentence><sentence id="1254">That may or may not be good for him in the long run, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1255">I've tried to encourage him to be independent.</sentence><sentence id="1256">He was the first of all of his friends to travel on his own through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1257">I have entrusted him since th-the fourth grade, basically, with being on his own and shifting for himself.</sentence><sentence id="1258">I expect him to lead his friends.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I -- I've always tried to foster in him the ability to lead not only himself, but his friends.</sentence><sentence id="1260">To be responsible for himself and his friends, to keep a lookout for himself and his friends, to protect them, but to achieve.</sentence><sentence id="1261">And the funny thing is that things i-in many ways have gone that way, and among his friends, whether by dint of his upbringing here, or the fact that he is among the older of the children in his age group, or a combination of those factors, he is looked upon by the other children as a sort of a social hub, a leadership figure.</sentence><sentence id="1262">And perhaps it's because he's so involved in sports and the boys follow him in that way.</sentence><sentence id="1265">Interview with Harry Gelb * December 13, 2001 Perhaps it's because he actually is very talented in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1266">That he's getting homework help calls all the time, and his guidance is sought as to what is expected of them in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1267">It's just that he -- he's grown up to be a very unusual child in that regard.</sentence><sentence id="1268">The downside of this is that his tolerance for others and his patience with them sometimes wears a little bit thin.</sentence><sentence id="1269">So I think that these might be the sorts of responsibilities that a 12 or 13 year old boy shouldn't have thrust upon him.</sentence><sentence id="1270">But he handles it pretty well overall, and -- and -- and his friends love him.</sentence><sentence id="1271">He has a whole crowd of -- of friends that are hanging out here all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1272">One, we've always tried to make th-the other kids feel welcome around our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so that they -- they -- they should always feel they have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to come, if they want to sleep over, or they want to hang here, have dinner.</sentence><sentence id="1273">Whatever they want, they're welcome to stay, it's fine by me.</sentence><sentence id="1274">And it's alway -- it's fine by Cheryl, too, it's -- it's fine by all of us, but we -- we always want our children to have their friends welcome.</sentence></p></dialogue>

declared intention of -- of educating others about what happened in the Holocaust so that -- so that people are, for all of the rest of history, aware that such -- such intense and organized evil could be perpetrated on -- on a -- a discrete population in so short a time.</sentence><sentence id="1381">I also ha- have tried in my professional career, to spend as much of my time as possible, helping refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1382">Since I started at this -- at this <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> -- when I say at the administration for children's services, then known as HRA, whatever, but it doesn't matter, at this same agency, which is the foster care agency for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, I started there in January 1983, I have been the sole

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1440">A: Quite frankly, I -- I do very, very little for -- for fun, myself.</sentence><sentence id="1441">I don't get to see my friends very often.</sentence><sentence id="1442">Most of my activities are involved around providing care for, or joining in the activities of each of my two children.</sentence><sentence id="1443">And it's becoming increasingly demanding as little Joseph, now being a-age four, is starting to have a broader circle of friends and different interests and activities.</sentence><sentence id="1444">I am now challenged with keeping up with both Max's activities, whether that is his ice hockey or his soccer or his swimming or his basketball, and Joe's new circle of friends and activities.</sentence><sentence id="1445">Is -- it's -- it's always -- always a challenge, always fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1456">A: Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1457">Max has, I believe since either the first or second grade, been attending <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, and Joseph, who is in his last year of <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> now,</sentence><sentence id="1459">Interview with Harry Gelb *" December 13, 2001 just started <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> two months ago.</sentence><sentence id="1460">We belong to a <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood synagogue</span> and Max is currently studying for his Bar Mitzvah which is going to be in February of the year 2002.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1467">Q: Any particular holidays that you especially like, or any family rituals that happen for some reason?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1469">A: If you're speaking about Jewish holidays, i-i-in particular it has always been my joy and distinct pleasure in celebrating Passover with the Lerman cousins, so to speak and aunt and uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1470">This is what we did as children, we meaning Paul and I. We always went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vineland</span> for Pesach, always, and it 1-i- is perhaps my, and I -- I'm sure it is many other children's favorite holidays, but celebrating the -- the escape to freedom of the Jewish people from enslavement in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But just being with that family at that time of year has always meant something very special for me, and -- and I know it has for my brother Paul as well.</sentence><sentence id="1472">And we continue to go there every year and I bring my children and my wife down to spend a Lerman Passover with them, an-and I'm glad to say that they enjoy it as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1477">Q: How do you feel about quote, Holocaust education, unquote?</sentence><sentence id="1478">In -- and special programs in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and everything, but also at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1479">Do you</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1498">Q: In gen -- sort of general terms, or particular, whatever, what do you feel has been the impact of the Holocaust on your mother and on you, as the son, as this -- the next generation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1500">A: That's a -- that's a very broad question, but I'm not criticizing you for it.</sentence><sentence id="1501">I will try to answer it as succinctly as possible, so that should take three or four hours -- no seriously --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: Fine, go ahead.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1505">63 Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1506">A: I'm sure, to use the lay word baggage, that my -- that my mother and every Holocaust survivor carries with them baggage, some of which they -- this psychological baggage, th -- damage, or benefits, whatever, that some of them may recognize and -- and others don't even recognize it, it -- that will always be in their subconscious.</sentence><sentence id="1507">But I think my mother has made a distinct effort to -- as many others have, to rise above her experiences, to evaluate them, to see what -- what good she can identify in her experiences and what evil she can identify 1-i-in her experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1508">To identify the moral values of -- of what she -- what she learned through those experiences, and through seeing the loss of her family and the rebirth of an entire generation, and now s-succeeding generations o-of -- of Jews in the post-Holocaust world.</sentence><sentence id="1509">I know my mother states all of the time, just straight out, that people shouldn't allow even the most negative events in their life, to drag them down.</sentence><sentence id="1510">But on the other hand, I -- I -- I'm sure she recognized that one cannot but have that happen, even if you make every conscious effort to prevent it from being so.</sentence><sentence id="1511">Yet, a -- ]-[ know that my mother has always tried to -- to look back on -- on that era with an objective -- as objective as possible, historical eye.</sentence><sentence id="1512">And not to become too emotionally distraught when either e-evaluating or we -- those experiences, or relating them to others.</sentence><sentence id="1513">And I -- I think that her sisters share with her those goals</sentence><sentence id="1515">Interview with Harry Gelb "4 December 13, 2001 about overcoming their experience and -- and have -- all three of them, I think, have tried to pass that on to the -- to my cousins, so to speak, to their children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1527">Q: What about you?</sentence><sentence id="1528">I mean, I know it's not an easy question, but if you kind of, you know, thought about it for a minute, what do you think the impact of the Holocaust was on you, however directly or indirectly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A: I think that in many ways, I mean, directly, and I -- I suppose it's easy to say that -- that it -- it -- it awakened a degree of social consciousness in me.</sentence><sentence id="1532">But I think o0-o- other people are motivated by other things and arrive at -- at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I find myself, but perhaps -- for me this is -- this is what -- what does it.</sentence><sentence id="1533">I think it uncanny that I met and then married someone who is the -- like me, a -- a -- a child of -- of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1534">Yeah, I don't know whether that is good or bad, I think it's a very unique bond.</sentence><sentence id="1535">I -- I found in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and now I'm -- I'm a supervisor in -- in -- in our <span class="BUILDING">Bronx office</span>, and through conversation after being there a year, I found out that one of my co-workers, who is significantly younger than me is also the child of a survivor who was a hidden child.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And he was hidden as a very, very -- he's even younger -- he was born sometime in the 1930's and waited a while to have children after coming here and marrying, so this co-worker of mine 1-is significantly younger.</sentence><sentence id="1537">And yet, I know that -- that she and I feel an -- an -- sort of there's an unusual kinship or bond there, even though his -- his, meaning her father's</sentence><sentence id="1539">Interview with Harry Gelb degdeg December 13, 2001 experience, wartime experiences, and my mother's were -- were quite dissimilar.</sentence><sentence id="1540">But i-i-it's an unusual bond.</sentence><sentence id="1541">I am sure that other people who share similar traumatic experiences in their family histories probably feel a similar bond as well, but this is what our family feels, and this is what Laura's family feels.</sentence><sentence id="1542">And I'm sure that -- you know, and my wife and her sister and all of my cousins, we all feel the same.</sentence><sentence id="1543">It's just an unusual way to identify -- I think that there are many Jews who identify as being Jews in large part due to the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust somehow awakening a Jewish identity in them.</sentence><sentence id="1544">I suppose religious motivation comes from many different things in one's upbringing.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So in mine, obviously, it must come in large part due to the fact that my mother herself is a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="1546">Never -- nevertheless, i-it ca -- her experiences cannot but have a-affected my outlook on the world, on religion, on my social values and morals, and by the way I raise my family.</sentence><sentence id="1547">And the fact that my wife is also a survivor's child will only magnify the impact -- or whatever impact it does have on our children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1566">Q: I think I probably would have a couple of more questions, but at this point I think this was a pretty good ending, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Do you feel that something important has not been addressed?</sentence><sentence id="1568">I mean, take a second to just think if there's something that you want to say, or something that I should have asked and didn't, that was kind of important to your life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1574">66 Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1575">A: I don't think there's any particular thing that you -- you haven't asked about my background, or about my wife's background.</sentence><sentence id="1576">I think it is important, however, that Holocaust information be memorialized in the coming years as the generation of survivors grows older and older, they obviously are going to pass away.</sentence><sentence id="1577">And without them there is going to be no true firsthand source of evidence and of fact about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1578">And the Holocaust deniers and the present persecutors of Jews, and bigots and hate-mongers will only find fuel for -- for their intolerance should there not be amassed the -- the proper history and documentation of the Jewish people during the Holocaust years.</sentence><sentence id="1579">So my overall wish would be that all of us, both the current living survivors and their descendants try now to somehow memorialize and record these historical facts so that subsequent generations can benefit from a true rendition of what happened during the 1930's and 40's.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1585">Q: Why did you agree to do this int -- why do -- why did you agree to do this interview?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1587">A: In many -- ob-obviously, the -- the fact that this is something that is important to my mother weighed on me, but even if it were not, e -- I would gladly -- even if my mother weren't a survivor, if I was just, let's just say a -- a child of American Jews, and you'd come to ask me about how the Holocaust bore on -- on my development a-and life today, I would have gladly participated because I think that the -- the</sentence><sentence id="1589">67 Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 events of such a mass tragedy weigh so heavily on the development of -- o-of world culture that they -- they should be documented and interpreted.</sentence><sentence id="1590">I think that what's going on today as we speak, in -- in the -- a-as Bush calls it, the war against terror, but i-it -- it's basically a -- a war against terrorists who hate <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and hate Jews, is very much involved in -- in interpretation of facts of the Holocaust and how the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> came into being as a result of the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Well obviously, I-I -- I have absolutely no tolerance for terrorists of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="1603">That -- and that would go for -- for terrorists that are advocating or -- or bombing to convince people to believe in any particular area of thought.</sentence><sentence id="1604">However, because so much o-o-of this current terror campaign is involved in a hatred of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and of th-the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and Jews, I do have very strong opinions.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And it is my unfortunate belief that although -- and I say unfortunate because I -- I -- I'm sad to find myself feeling this way, although I ha -- I have tremendous fondness for many</sentence><sentence id="1607">Interview with Harry Gelb degdeg December 13, 2001 people who are -- are Muslim, and who live here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, like myself, I quite frankly, based on their religious beliefs, and the -- and their culture, do not believe that they will ever -- th-the Islamic world will ever be able to accept the existence of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1608">They -- they -- I -- I think that much of their hatred is tantamount -- although it is worded differently than Hitler's hatred of the Jews, I think it's tantamount to Hitler's hatred of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1609">And although the -- the current terrorists will never be able to perpetrate the mass execution o-of Jews, as -- as Hitler and the Nazis were, I still think that were that to be a thing within their grasp, many of these people would not hesitate to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1610">I -- even -- even among Muslims of a -- a more gentle persuasion who are not violent like -- like the terrorists, I really -- I-I sincerely question whether even they, based upon their doctrine and their beliefs and their culture will ever able to be accept -- to be able to accept the fact of the existence of a Jewish state in the land of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1611">And I think that these hatreds are so deep seated, and -- and so old, going back now thousands of years, that I don't -- I -- I -- I sa -- it's sad to say, I don't feel that they can ever be overcome.</sentence><sentence id="1612">I don't know what to do about it, but you ask me how I feel about what's going on now, and this is actually how I feel.</sentence><sentence id="1613">It -- it -- it -- it's very hurtful to me, it's very hurtful to my family, it's something that affects all Americans, not just Jews, a-as you could see from the tragedies on -- on September</sentence><sentence id="1615">69 Interview with Harry Gelb December 13, 2001 11", So the fact that terrorists have identified <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> f -- e-either for its support of the state of int -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, or as a land of moral turpitude, or as a some sort 0-0-of hated kingdom, for whatever reason I don't understand, it does affect every American, and i-i-it is an area th-that all people i-in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> should consider each day of their life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
