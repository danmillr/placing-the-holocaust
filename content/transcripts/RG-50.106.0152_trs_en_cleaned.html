<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: You said you were with the Jewish agency groups.</sentence><sentence id="271">Where were you exactly?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Do you remember the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="368">Can you talk a little bit about that?</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: We were there only two months, and we -- we were just there, I think, for sleeping, because we spent most of that time in the hos -- near the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and -- and on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="374">We didn't have much education, no there was no education, I mean, there was nothing going on.</sentence><sentence id="375">At the time it was not organized for that yet.</sentence><sentence id="376">Very early, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: Do you know when?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="383">A: I don't, I'm afraid.</sentence><sentence id="384">But as I said, I found that we were there in 19 -- in -- in April 1946, so that -- that's the date that I have because I found some document that states April deg46, we were there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: Did you have any trouble letting go of some of the behaviors you had to use to survive during the war, like you know, did you have any trouble with your name or with anything else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: I didn't have any na -- trouble with my name.</sentence><sentence id="390">I do remember when we first found Father and we -- he ha -- he brought a -- a chauffeur and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> and we traveled through -- through part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and at one point we got off and went into some <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- side -- what do they call it, the <span class="DLF">gardens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="391">And we found these beautiful red cherries and we picked up some and we came -- came to -- back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he almost killed us.</sentence><sentence id="392">I mean, he was furious.</sentence><sentence id="393">He told us no more stealing.</sentence><sentence id="394">We were</sentence><sentence id="396">so used to do that during the war in order to survive.</sentence><sentence id="397">So that stands out in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="398">What was the other question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: Do you have any trouble, you know, just identifying yourself as a Jew at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: No, not I, but my sister.</sentence><sentence id="413">My sister, who did not know she was Jewish, because we couldn't tell her, she was too young.</sentence><sentence id="414">When my cousin from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> came, even though he didn't look that Jewish, she immediately recognized that he had a long nose, and she said, Arayed, you're Jewish, but you're nice.</sentence><sentence id="415">And he said, but you're Jewish too.</sentence><sentence id="416">And she said absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="417">She would not believe him.</sentence><sentence id="418">And it took her quite awhile before she accepted it, but I had no trouble, no.</sentence><sentence id="419">I just kept going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, though.</sentence><sentence id="420">I was so used to it, I kept going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> until they stopped me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
