<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: -- in 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: This must have been very shocking to you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: It was a complete shock to me.</sentence><sentence id="261">It was a life changing hour, and a growing up hour, and also of taking things in hand.</sentence><sentence id="262">My mother was an extremely nervous person, very hysterical for everything, so I became the leader with my mother, because I was more calm.</sentence><sentence id="263">And so I aged very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="264">At that time, that day when everything went awry, my father started to say we've got to leave here.</sentence><sentence id="265">But then, things happened so fast.</sentence><sentence id="266">The very first week of Hitler's coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, somebody came with a rifle, knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span>, and said, "Car keys."</sentence><sentence id="267">That wa -- that's all that -- that was the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">interchange</span>, and we handed over the car keys.</sentence><sentence id="268">And then somebody came and said, "I like this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="269">My parents had bought it before they were married, and had put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and -- a co -- like a co-op, they had done all the alterations and everything, it was ours.</sentence><sentence id="270">And we had to be out in six hours or die.</sentence><sentence id="271">And what do you do first?</sentence><sentence id="272">Do you pack, do you find a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, do you moo -- what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="273">So one of my parents went and got boxes, and one went to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, and I started packing.</sentence><sentence id="274">And in six hours we were out with as much as we could pack.</sentence><sentence id="275">The rest we had to leave just like it was.</sentence><sentence id="276">You know, we had all kinds of built ins, and things, and was all gone.</sentence><sentence id="277">And the -- we moved to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because it was an very old <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and most of the people there had to move out quickly, had to move into <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that, so that was quite a shock.</sentence><sentence id="278">We had two <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, and you were no longer allowed to have employees that were not Jewish, and we always had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, living in, and she had to leave, and the people in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> could no longer help us.</sentence><sentence id="279">So -- but they were still open, and we were trying to sell enough to have enough money to -- for every day things, because the bank accounts were closed, and all in all, this was our income.</sentence><sentence id="280">So we lived like that until Kristallnacht -- Crystal Night.</sentence><sentence id="281">Kristallnacht, we woke up in the morning, and my father had said -- we didn't know it was happening, and my father said, "Things are getting so bad."</sentence><sentence id="282">This was already November.</sentence><sentence id="283">He said, ""Why don't I take some of our valuables to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and hide them there?"</sentence><sentence id="284">And he took out cameras, and some jewelry, and -- and he left.</sentence><sentence id="285">And as he left the phone rang, and my girlfriend called and said, "Don't let your father leave," and hung up.</sentence><sentence id="286">We had no idea what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="287">You know, what people don't realize is there was no television, and there was -- there was very little communication, so that nobody knew it was happening, really.</sentence><sentence id="288">So about two minutes later, doorbell rang, and it was my father, and he said, "I'm lost.</sentence><sentence id="289">I'll never see you again, they arrested me, and they're taking me away."</sentence><sentence id="290">And I knew one of the men, and I ask him could I leave some keys with you?</sentence><sentence id="291">So he had all this camera, and jewelry and all on him, and he took that and put it somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="292">And then he put on long underwear because he was cold, and my mother was almost screaming.</sentence><sentence id="293">And then she had an idea, and she went next <span class="DLF">door</span> to the neighbor, it was a Jewish woman with a son who was not well.</sentence><sentence id="294">He was Si -- a very sickly man at the time.</sentence><sentence id="295">And she said to her, "Would you hide my husband?"</sentence><sentence id="296">And she said yes, and she put my father in her <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">They came and took her son away, and she didn't tell them that my father was hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="298">Luckily at that time, there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> yet, so they send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they -- they didn't know what to do with him.</sentence><sentence id="299">So we felt better that we -- you know, that my father survived, and he did, too.</sentence><sentence id="300">But this is how it was done.</sentence><sentence id="301">It was -- it -- it snuck up on us.</sentence><sentence id="302">It -- it -- we couldn't believe people would do things like that.</sentence><sentence id="303">So then we didn't know what to do about my father, then we found out from the radio that the Viennese had 24 hours to do with the Jews as they pleased.</sentence><sentence id="304">And they were taking away Jews from everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="305">Men.</sentence><sentence id="306">They -- they put men into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and things, but they had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the women yet, that came later.</sentence><sentence id="307">But I went downstairs and got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxicab</span>, and my father laid down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>, and the cab driver did not give us away.</sentence><sentence id="308">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- one of our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, and we have a friend, a mutual friend of my husband and mine, who was helping us out in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, and he had opened it that day.</sentence><sentence id="309">And we went in there -- we closed the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with the <span class="DLF">iron gates</span> from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and nothing.</sentence><sentence id="311">We wen -- we went in there and we closed that.</sentence><sentence id="312">And this young man and I, and my mother and father stayed in there.</sentence><sentence id="313">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>, and my girlfriend kept us aware of what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="314">She also sent somebody with some sandwiches to po -- put under the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">We didn't know how long we didn't there -- we would be there.</sentence><sentence id="316">We stayed about 30 some hours in there, and even though it was so terrible, we told stories -- we had no light, we couldn't turn on a light.</sentence><sentence id="317">People knocked on the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, and we didn't open.</sentence><sentence id="318">And then finally my girlfriend says they have lifted this terrible thing that -- of Kristallnacht, and she said, you can come out now, I think.</sentence><sentence id="319">But we were still scared.</sentence><sentence id="320">And when we looked out, the Nazis had put a swastika seal on the key lock -- on the -- where the key goes, and at that time the keys were these large keys with the long tops.</sentence><sentence id="321">And I took a key, the key from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and I unlocked it, and it didn't tear.</sentence><sentence id="322">Because that would have been certain death.</sentence><sentence id="323">Nobody could hurt the swastika seal.</sentence><sentence id="324">We ha -- w -- I had an aunt that wa -- had no husband.</sentence><sentence id="325">She lived with her sister and her daughter, and my father went in to hide there, because they didn't expect a man to be there.</sentence><sentence id="326">And he spend the next two days there.</sentence><sentence id="327">The young man that was with us, was -- they looked for him many times.</sentence><sentence id="328">He would not have survived if he had been hiding with us.</sentence><sentence id="329">It was a horrendous day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: When you went out of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and this was right after Kristallnacht --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: What did you see?</sentence><sentence id="405">What was -- what was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: A lot of broken glass.</sentence><sentence id="409">All <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> had been torched, or broken.</sentence><sentence id="410">All the merchandise was either looted, or thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="411">It was -- it was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="412">And w-we couldn't believe we survived it, or that my father survived it.</sentence><sentence id="413">And h-he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after two days, and we had no more <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, we had nothing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="414">I remember going out of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, I even took money out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cash register</span>, I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="415">But we -- we -- thank God we survived it, and we were looking for ways to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">As you know, nobody wanted us.</sentence><sentence id="417">No <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> wanted us.</sentence><sentence id="418">The <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, most of the time just were closed to us, and you couldn't get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> unless you had a permit to go to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="419">So we had no such thing.</sentence><sentence id="420">And then, after that, it was probably in January, my father got an invitation to come to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="421">And nobody ever came back from that.</sentence><sentence id="422">And that same day, the same friend was visiting me, and my father said, "I'm leaving."</sentence><sentence id="423">And -- and my mother says, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="424">He says, "Pll find something, but I'm not going to the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: Yeah -- no, they usually took five or six for one trip.</sentence><sentence id="563">Some of them had bought out the border police, but not all of
