<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Now, there were other people, other relatives of yours, who were very involved with the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: We went to <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">We, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">diocese</span> or, you know, the lay, not the lay, but the nun, <span class="BUILDING">monastic schools</span>, are called <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">It has nothing to do with <span class="BUILDING">American college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">You're in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> from your first grade on.</sentence><sentence id="155">Until your 12th grade.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, yes, I did go to, first to a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where the nuns were running the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was very privileged in having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten teacher, and I've never forgot her.</sentence><sentence id="157">I still remember her as being a real guidance.</sentence><sentence id="158">And then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, St. Bonefas(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">Where my father had been, where my uncles had been.</sentence><sentence id="160">And it was almost a family tradition already.</sentence><sentence id="161">Still in existence now.</sentence><sentence id="162">And, in fact, my brother was there, too.</sentence><sentence id="163">And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins, actually, went through the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was a very, very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">I had the best teachers you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="166">And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="167">No, I loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">I just adored my teachers.</sentence><sentence id="169">In the seventh grade I had a very tall, very powerful looking priest as a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="170">And I can still hear him talking.</sentence><sentence id="171">He was extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="172">He made us live Julius Caesar's wars.</sentence><sentence id="173">Like you'd see a movie.</sentence><sentence id="174">And a couple of three years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian Alden(ph), the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> are and those people have their feet on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">Solidly on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and he did, too.</sentence><sentence id="176">And, again, I have such extraordinary memories from my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, you know, that I still relive them constantly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Because you came from a family that at least was partly quite religious and you went to <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span>, were there certain values that were instilled in you from an early age?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Oh, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="206">Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="207">As I told you, my grandmother was running the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> even from a distance, she was still running her children.</sentence><sentence id="208">Her <span class="BUILDING">children's houses</span> with her strong principles that, you know, of charity, of tolerance.</sentence><sentence id="209">Even though she was strict, she was tolerant.</sentence><sentence id="210">You know, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="211">She was strict in her tolerance, you see what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="212">You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you couldn't feel it immediately.</sentence><sentence id="213">You just had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="214">And that was one of the principles that she inoculated into us from our very, very small childhood.</sentence><sentence id="215">And I think my, all my uncles and aunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles.</sentence><sentence id="216">So, yes, mostly Christian values.</sentence><sentence id="217">And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non- Christian people?</sentence><sentence id="218">Like the Jews and so on.</sentence><sentence id="219">We didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="220">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, you didn't make that distinction.</sentence><sentence id="221">I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS came and took them away.</sentence><sentence id="222">We were friends with them, we played in the <span class="DLF">park</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="223">We, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was not at all a discriminatory <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or discriminating country.</sentence><sentence id="224">I'm bringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you have to say, I am Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="225">There is no such thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">The identity cards that were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="227">It mentioned profession, job, that they did.</sentence><sentence id="228">But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of discriminatory inkling, if | may say.</sentence><sentence id="229">So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high values were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that included that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were.</sentence><sentence id="230">Not because they had red hair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="231">But, because they were just people.</sentence><sentence id="232">I think that is of extreme importance for what is going to follow.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: No, I was not.</sentence><sentence id="264">I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, for example.</sentence><sentence id="265"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if you want.</sentence><sentence id="266">Which was definitely anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="267">We didn't have that.</sentence><sentence id="268">Actually, it's to the point that we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">Because we had no way of knowing.</sentence><sentence id="270">We had no records.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Were you, as a kid, involved with any social or political organizations?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Not a political organization.</sentence><sentence id="273">I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="274">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there were the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts.</sentence><sentence id="275">They were friendly, but they were different.</sentence><sentence id="276">I was part of the Christian cub scouts.</sentence><sentence id="277">Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was part of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things.</sentence><sentence id="278">But, it didn't amount to very much.</sentence><sentence id="279">Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group activity, let's say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: And, your family, while they believed very strongly in charity, was that ever on any organized basis before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: My grandmother had a <span class="DLF">route</span>, if you want to say, or <span class="DLF">route</span> where she went and distributed food on a certain day every month.</sentence><sentence id="291">Part of the St. Vincent DePaul general organization, which exists in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and exists in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And it consists of lay people who just get together and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families.</sentence><sentence id="293">They visit them, and I think this is still being done, I'm not sure, but I think so.</sentence><sentence id="294">Right now.</sentence><sentence id="295">They bring them food or clothes and try to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="296">That was, in a way, organized, if you want.</sentence><sentence id="297">Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide organization for the blind.</sentence><sentence id="298">And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of that for quite some time.</sentence><sentence id="299">And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind people assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as necessary.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: One other <span class="NPIP">question</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">What kind of a child were you?</sentence><sentence id="312">If you had to sort of describe your energy, your...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="317">But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but I do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child.</sentence><sentence id="318">So, I guess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she wanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="319">I think she taught me good social behavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery.</sentence><sentence id="320">I was running up and down and doing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things.</sentence><sentence id="321">Like making mud pies and throwing them at each other.</sentence><sentence id="322">And one day my aunt visited us and my mother just showed her out to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and while they were gone, we decided to sample the port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was spinning so much around me.</sentence><sentence id="323">And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up the next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure.</sentence><sentence id="324">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, as I say, I enjoyed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> enormously.</sentence><sentence id="325">And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty decent grades.</sentence><sentence id="327">That way.</sentence><sentence id="328">It wasn't any, you know, great effort.</sentence><sentence id="329">I didn't really force myself, I just studied because I thought it was fun.</sentence><sentence id="330">And particularly the literary branches, such as Latin, Greek.</sentence><sentence id="331">And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were something where I literally basked in learning those.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not always cloistered.</sentence><sentence id="351">In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">Even before the war.</sentence><sentence id="353">He taught catechism at the <span class="DLF">Belgian border</span> to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi children who would cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> before World War II to learn catechism because it was forbidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and under Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="354">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> during the sad events of 1938 and so on.</sentence><sentence id="355">And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out for, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee where he made me jump on his knee.</sentence><sentence id="356">And I liked him very, very much.</sentence><sentence id="357">He was the image of perfection to me.</sentence><sentence id="358">He was almost a semi-god.</sentence><sentence id="359">I had an excellent relationship with him and I kept that relation throughout until his death.</sentence><sentence id="360">Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him as much as I wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="361">But, I had an excellent relationship with him.</sentence><sentence id="362">He was a very warm, outgoing person, very funny, too.</sentence><sentence id="363">He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: ...German refugees coming in?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="494">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="495">We had the same reflex that the Germans had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under Hitler's day that always look behind us to see if we weren't being followed.</sentence><sentence id="496">And, yeah, the presence was heavy.</sentence><sentence id="497">And they made their presence known.</sentence><sentence id="498">Like, every Saturday, they had a victory parade.</sentence><sentence id="499">Every Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="500">A victory parade in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">And they would parade in front of the <span class="BUILDING">royal palace</span> and then stop there and have a band concert.</sentence><sentence id="502">And they were pretty obvious.</sentence><sentence id="503">As I say, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span>, you had to be careful what you said because there were always some ears that shouldn't hear what you were saying.</sentence><sentence id="504">Oh, I remember, for example, one day I was, that was probably toward the end of the war, must have been "44, I was standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> there and a man was seated <span class="NPIP">inside</span> reading a newspaper and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people.</sentence><sentence id="505">And everybody had to put their hands up.</sentence><sentence id="506">And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a pistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this.</sentence><sentence id="507">The Germans searched him but didn't look inside his newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="508">And he was never found out.</sentence><sentence id="509">But, you know, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="545">How your life, personally, changed.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes.</sentence><sentence id="547">Because they tried to go easy.</sentence><sentence id="548">And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor.</sentence><sentence id="549">We did not have a Golighter(ph).</sentence><sentence id="550">We didn't have an SS general at that time.</sentence><sentence id="551">We only had one general who was an anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="552">General Alexander from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falkenhausen(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="553">Who was an old Prussian aristocrat who actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians.</sentence><sentence id="554">So, the first few months were not all that bad actually.</sentence><sentence id="555">Except for the obvious presence of the German army.</sentence><sentence id="556">The parades and all that sort of things.</sentence><sentence id="557">And, of course, the rationing.</sentence><sentence id="558">The scarcity of essentials.</sentence><sentence id="559">Which, actually, became much, much worse as of probably 1943.</sentence><sentence id="560">In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were that miserable.</sentence><sentence id="561">But in 1942, then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> realized that the military governor was not being strong enough, was not being harsh enough.</sentence><sentence id="562">And we received then, an SS man who sort of took over the, quote, political aspect.</sentence><sentence id="563">In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army which in itself wasn't all that bad.</sentence><sentence id="564">That's when things began to change very drastically.</sentence><sentence id="565">The day-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="566">Various supplies.</sentence><sentence id="567">There was no gasoline for my father's little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep.</sentence><sentence id="568">But there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good.</sentence><sentence id="569">And things like that.</sentence><sentence id="570">And then, we began to see things changing even more drastically.</sentence><sentence id="571">That's when we saw people being taken away.</sentence><sentence id="572">We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="573">We thought maybe they had done some bad things.</sentence><sentence id="574">And were being put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for that.</sentence><sentence id="575">And then, pretty quickly, it became obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either something to do with the Resistance or simply hostages.</sentence><sentence id="576">People who were not Jewish that hadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of resistance and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="577">Or for having hidden resistance or people who were resistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed.</sentence><sentence id="578">That's another thing that didn't come immediately.</sentence><sentence id="579">Forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="580">Young people taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> forcibly to work.</sentence><sentence id="581">Not necessarily to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but to <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="582">Being paid a measly salary and living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">squalor</span> and terrible conditions.</sentence><sentence id="583">And, of course, it didn't take long before the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="584">Electricity became limited.</sentence><sentence id="585">We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night.</sentence><sentence id="586"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curfews</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="587">That began pretty early in the war.</sentence><sentence id="588">Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly enforced.</sentence><sentence id="589">Again, it was still the army at that time.</sentence><sentence id="590">But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police came, those things were strictly enforced.</sentence><sentence id="591">And if you were out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> at 8:30, you immediately went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="592">You know, not just getting a ticket or something.</sentence><sentence id="593">You were taken to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="594">And, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were limited.</sentence><sentence id="595">There was hardly any coal for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span>.</sentence><sentence id="596">Except for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish transports</span> that lever saw, at the end of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="598">At first I didn't realize what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="599">But, I saw lots of people being packed in, they weren't yet using <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">They were using very old third class <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with, which were boarded, the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were boarded up.</sentence><sentence id="601">And, but the people were still sitting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="602">They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">But, I saw them because there was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> only about three or four blocks from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">And the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were down and so you could see from a little <span class="DLF">wall</span> and there were <span class="DLF">iron gates</span>, if you want, you could see through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> what was going on down there.</sentence><sentence id="605">And I saw this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="606">And then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are?</sentence><sentence id="607">No.</sentence><sentence id="608">Well, these are Jewish people that are taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="609">That's the first time I ever saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">And I remember that as if it was yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="611">What else?</sentence><sentence id="612">Well, of course, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was down completely as far as activity is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="613">There were some <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span> playing German movies and propaganda, of course.</sentence><sentence id="614">All English or American or French movies were outlawed.</sentence><sentence id="615">I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944.</sentence><sentence id="616">When, just after the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="617">My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing.</sentence><sentence id="618">Then after World War II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but that's neither here nor there.</sentence><sentence id="619">During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that was important.</sentence><sentence id="620">Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it.</sentence><sentence id="621">As I say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things began to go very badly.</sentence><sentence id="622">We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or two.</sentence><sentence id="623">Sometimes maybe twice a week.</sentence><sentence id="624">Meat was rarely, rarely available.</sentence><sentence id="625">We were extremely lucky in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an enormous bank of herring began to swim right off the <span class="REGION">Belgian coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="626">Within a mile or so.</sentence><sentence id="627">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boats</span> were allowed two <span class="DLF">lines</span>, so they were allowed to go and fish those herring.</sentence><sentence id="628">And for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="629">And I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting until 10:00 or 11:00 in <span class="DLF">line</span>, standing there.</sentence><sentence id="630">Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="631">And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that.</sentence><sentence id="632">My mother had to learn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had herring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life.</sentence><sentence id="633">But it saved us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="722">Q: What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: <span class="BUILDING">School</span>, at first there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a few months.</sentence><sentence id="725">But it started again in September.</sentence><sentence id="726">You know, the war began in May, it started again in September.</sentence><sentence id="727">And the first year it was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as usual.</sentence><sentence id="728">But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi controlled versions were allowed.</sentence><sentence id="729">We were, that was mostly in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> later on.</sentence><sentence id="730">But, we were allowed to learn English after we had learned German first.</sentence><sentence id="731">It sounded awful at the time, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and all 0 my classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and English.</sentence><sentence id="732">Which has served me well, you know, later in my life.</sentence><sentence id="733">So, I guess I owe that to the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="734">But, I'm not grateful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: You've spoken about some of the ways in which your life was changed by the occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="748">Were you aware of the different kinds of restrictions on Jewish people?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="750">And we saw some of our friends being taken away.</sentence><sentence id="751">And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know, they're taken away.</sentence><sentence id="752">Because they are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="753">As I told you before, we didn't even have an inkling before World War II.</sentence><sentence id="754">We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go?Do you go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or do you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="755">If they went to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>, we would see them because they would go to the same one we did.</sentence><sentence id="756">But, the other people who were not in our <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, we didn't ask them what they did or where they went or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know.</sentence><sentence id="757">Yeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a transport taken by a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his <span class="DLF">office window</span> which was just above the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they took the people.</sentence><sentence id="758">So he took a picture, this was obviously forbidden, but he did anyway.</sentence><sentence id="759">They didn't catch him.</sentence><sentence id="760">We still have that picture.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="774">Q: Were they wearing the yellow star?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="776">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="777">As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars.</sentence><sentence id="778">And, of course, at that time, it became quite obvious.</sentence><sentence id="779">Then in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="780">I have a picture of that, too.</sentence><sentence id="781">They were forced to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">And when it was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating.</sentence><sentence id="783">But when it was raining they had their feet in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we didn't have any good shoes anyway.</sentence><sentence id="784">Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they would just fall apart in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="785">If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might have survived it, even though resenting it.</sentence><sentence id="786">But, that was only the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="787">The yellow star, there were a number of people who in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>, would ostentatiously get up and give their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> to a person wearing a yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="788">Particularly if there were German officers or German soldiers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="789">They would deliberately show, you know, say, please take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it.</sentence><sentence id="791">I've seen it happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="808">Q: What was the reaction from the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="810">A: Very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="811">They wouldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="812">You know, actually, the individual German, particularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly aggressive when alone.</sentence><sentence id="813">As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive than the German army people.</sentence><sentence id="814">Now, I'm not talking about the SS.</sentence><sentence id="815">But we didn't see the SS all that much.</sentence><sentence id="816">They were always in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">They hardly ever were on foot.</sentence><sentence id="818">The people on foot were mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when 1 they were asked to do a search.</sentence><sentence id="819">And, you know, to line people up against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and search them and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt.</sentence><sentence id="820">In general, the population was very understanding and sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="821">Now, there were a few bad ones.</sentence><sentence id="822">And I'm not going to deny that.</sentence><sentence id="823">I'm not proud of it.</sentence><sentence id="824">Nobody is.</sentence><sentence id="825">But, it wasn't as bad as in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">I can assure you of that.</sentence><sentence id="827">We could see that a number of <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> where we had been shopping regularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed.</sentence><sentence id="828">There was nobody there any more.</sentence><sentence id="829">And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, take over the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="857">And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as we said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time.</sentence><sentence id="858">They, you will hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the largest newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> was actually Nazi controlled completely.</sentence><sentence id="859">But, interestingly enough, it was Jewish owned.</sentence><sentence id="860">But the owner went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, so the paper was taken over by pro-Nazi people.</sentence><sentence id="861">The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the Catholic ones, just shut down.</sentence><sentence id="862">They didn't publish any more.</sentence><sentence id="863">So the only paper we really had was Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="864">Which was Nazi controlled entirely.</sentence><sentence id="865">Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in 1943, which is the national day of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which had been printed and put out by the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="866">And, at first, it was so well made that people didn't realize it was not the real one.</sentence><sentence id="867">And they just took it and then you could see the people picking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you know.</sentence><sentence id="868">We shall win and we'll crush the Bosch and naming all the traitors and that sort of thing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny stories were written in there, too.</sentence><sentence id="869">And that was a day of levity during World War II when the entire city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> was covered with Neswah, but not the real one.</sentence><sentence id="870">Which was, of course, much more real than the Nazi controlled one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: You speak of the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="887">How apparent was it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="890">A: It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had a housekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) if you want, cleaned the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hallway</span> where my father's patients would come because in Europe, many doctors had their <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it was very common.</sentence><sentence id="891">And so did my father.</sentence><sentence id="892">And her son was a career soldier in the Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one of the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us, because he had to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing 2 and he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there.</sentence><sentence id="893">So, I became quickly aware that there was something going on.</sentence><sentence id="894">And so did my sister and brother who were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again.</sentence><sentence id="895">Roger, Roger.</sentence><sentence id="896">Yeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was exactly my age and slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook me and said, hurry up, open the <span class="DLF">back windows</span> and hurry up, the Germans are at the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">And Roger was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="898">Which was, of course, on purpose.</sentence><sentence id="899">He immediately ran out the <span class="DLF">roof windows</span>, you know those <span class="DLF">roof windows</span> in Europe where you can lift like a trap, the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and he ran out that way and was able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, but, you know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there.</sentence><sentence id="900">So, they searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually.</sentence><sentence id="901">And they searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, didn't find anything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his passage.</sentence><sentence id="902">And after that, he never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="903">It must have been later in the war, it must have been 1943 or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="904">And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement.</sentence><sentence id="905">I don't think we made any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance.</sentence><sentence id="906">That probably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time.</sentence><sentence id="907">But then, when my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early "43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently.</sentence><sentence id="908">We, he didn't say anything, you know, he was very, very quiet and never said a word.</sentence><sentence id="909">He never said, I am helping Jewish children escape.</sentence><sentence id="910">But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know?</sentence><sentence id="911">And at that point, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal.</sentence><sentence id="912">And I didn't say anything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an adult.</sentence><sentence id="913">And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive with me.</sentence><sentence id="914">I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to.</sentence><sentence id="915">And so he became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> or there would be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is Robert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="916">But, and, do you know where such and such <span class="DLF">street</span> is?</sentence><sentence id="917">Yes, I do.</sentence><sentence id="918">Well, why don't you take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and go to such and such <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there and tell them that Robert is looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="919">And that's all he ever said.</sentence><sentence id="920">You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="921">And Robert always had a war name, a different name.</sentence><sentence id="922">One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called him Roger.</sentence><sentence id="923">Roger Dumois(ph).</sentence><sentence id="924">And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six months.</sentence><sentence id="925">In my other uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, my younger uncle, the dentist.</sentence><sentence id="926">Jean(ph), who worked in very close cooperation with Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="927">That was my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he was the only child of my grandmother's who stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> after he was married because he occupied my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">medical office</span> as a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="928">So he didn't have to look for another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my grandmother just took the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper floor</span> for herself.</sentence><sentence id="929">And so, the kids were brought there frequently.</sentence><sentence id="930">I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span>, she had a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> because she had a lot of children.</sentence><sentence id="931">Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of course, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything.</sentence><sentence id="932">She says, Oh, we're just having a little party.</sentence><sentence id="933">And there were eight Jewish kids.</sentence><sentence id="934">One of whom stayed and, it 3 was a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my grandmother's <span class="DLF">curtains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="935">But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly.</sentence><sentence id="936">But, this is how I, you know, I realized what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="937">And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his real name.</sentence><sentence id="938">Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="939">I had never seen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that.</sentence><sentence id="940">But, after a while, of course, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him.</sentence><sentence id="941">And he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and disappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he had a, there was a better heating system in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> than in my parent's second <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which I didn't like anyway.</sentence><sentence id="942">And, so I did get to see quite a number of the proteges, as my uncle used to call them.</sentence><sentence id="943">And, okay, what else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Well, since you mentioned this boy that you actually lived with for quite some time, this Jewish boy, I'm just curious if you, what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="999">Was he scared?</sentence><sentence id="1000">Did you talk about things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally.</sentence><sentence id="1005">There was a feeling of security in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1006">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1008">He went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me to the <span class="BUILDING">College</span> , of course, where else?</sentence><sentence id="1009">It happens that that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is only about three or four blocks away from my grandparent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which is the main reason why everybody went there.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And so we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and sometimes we didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class.</sentence><sentence id="1011">But, usually at 4:00, which was dismissal time, we would wait for each other at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and just go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as if nothing had happened, and as if nothing was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Jumping like kids do, you know, and kicking a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span> once in awhile and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And he looked pretty happy.</sentence><sentence id="1014">It's only actually towards the very, very end of the war when I think he had an inkling that his parents had disappeared, that he became a little more sad and more, less expansive, less talkative.</sentence><sentence id="1015">But, for a good while there, we were just like two old buddies and playing games like you see kids do and doing our homework together and that sort of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1028">Q: Did he talk about what happened to his parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1034">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1035">No.</sentence><sentence id="1036">Actually, that was one thing that Father Bruno stressed upon them, to never talk about, never, your name is Joe Blow now, you don't have any parents, you are not Jewish, you are of Flemish descent, and your parents are travelling in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or something like that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1037">Or your parents are dead, you know, or something.</sentence><sentence id="1038">But, dead from other <span class="NPIP">causes</span> he meant.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1039">No, that was one thing he was very, very strong and stern about.</sentence><sentence id="1040">Do not ever talk about your family and things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="1041">So, even in my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, there was no such talk.</sentence><sentence id="1042">4 End of tape #2 5 Tape #3</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1043">..down a little bit, they might be a little...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1044">A: Well, they're already down.</sentence><sentence id="1045">No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a little.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1062">A: Sulky, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1064">Q: But I was asking you whether, at any point, you ever talked to him about what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1068">Q: What was going on in the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1070">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1071">That was a no-no.</sentence><sentence id="1072">And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about events surrounding the children.</sentence><sentence id="1073">Any child that was under his protection, if you want to say.</sentence><sentence id="1074">It just was too risky.</sentence><sentence id="1075">You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death, not only of the child, but everybody around the child.</sentence><sentence id="1076">So, no.</sentence><sentence id="1077">As little talk as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1078">How do you say that?</sentence><sentence id="1079">The enemy has ears everywhere?</sentence><sentence id="1080">Or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1081">We were very aware of that.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was already, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began to understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1083">Now, on the contrary, we had a little club, if you want, of school kids, we thought of ourselves as very important.</sentence><sentence id="1084">And we had a club which was our resistance club.</sentence><sentence id="1085">It didn't do much resistance, but we were organized as a military club.</sentence><sentence id="1086">There was a colonel and there was a couple of majors and a couple of captains and if you did well, if you, for example, you could report on seeing so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> going by, then you got promoted.</sentence><sentence id="1087">And if you had counted how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17's</span> are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a commendation of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="1088">We had to know by heart, all the types of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, enemy or 6 friendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1089">It didn't amount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1090">You know.</sentence><sentence id="1091">And we would hide in the, somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> so the Germans wouldn't hear us.</sentence><sentence id="1092">It was very secret.</sentence><sentence id="1093">That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1094">When I was still a little more innocent.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1120">Q: Did you every do any little, you mentioned putting the sugar in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tanks</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1123">That was part of our assignments.</sentence><sentence id="1124">If we did that, that was a great big promotion because, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And you could be promoted from second lieutenant all the way to major for doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And when my mother found out about that, was she every unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking.</sentence><sentence id="1129">And even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have definitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and that sort of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1138">Q: Were there other little sabotage activities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: Well, yeah, flat tires and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1141">For some reason, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would suddenly develop a flat tire.</sentence><sentence id="1142">I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick of wood and put that in the, what do you call this <span class="DLF">valve</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1143">Where they inflate the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tire</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1144">Push it in and there's a little peg in there that if you push it in, the <span class="DLF">air</span> goes out.</sentence><sentence id="1145">So, when nobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the <span class="DLF">air</span> would go out.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And the next morning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">And, but again, all that didn't amount to much.</sentence><sentence id="1148">But, it's just the spirit, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1149">We, it was a spirit of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1150">In our childish way, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1151">Go ahead, I'm sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1164">Q: Was that spirit of resistance fairly prevalent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1166">A: Well, I can only speak about my own <span class="NPIP">environment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">I would say that in my own <span class="NPIP">environment</span>, it was.</sentence><sentence id="1168">It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable and badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And, the eight children, except perhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the Bosch, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1170">And it was still there 25 years later.</sentence><sentence id="1171">You just don't get rid of that sort of resentment so easily.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had already been imparted to us between the wars.</sentence><sentence id="1173">You know, when they were telling stories, oh, do you remember so and so?</sentence><sentence id="1174">Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the French and da, da, da.</sentence><sentence id="1175">So, we were living, see <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has been occupied by foreign powers ever since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly independent minded people.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And it's only since 1830, that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has become a political entity of its own, a free, independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And then, but we, we have an ancestral tradition of hating the occupant.</sentence><sentence id="1178">You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the Spaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again.</sentence><sentence id="1179">And, yeah, that spirit of anti-occupant was very prevalent in my environment.</sentence><sentence id="1180">It's difficult for me to judge, you know, how it was in other families.</sentence><sentence id="1181">But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say.</sentence><sentence id="1182">7 We never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1183">On the contrary, my father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their anti-Nazi attitudes and actions.</sentence><sentence id="1184">One of them died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, the other one was killed by the SS on the last day of the occupation.</sentence><sentence id="1185">He was, they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and started shooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five minutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And then there was the governor of the <span class="BUILDING">national bank</span> who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And one day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr.Gallopan(ph)?</sentence><sentence id="1188">And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right on his <span class="DLF">doorstep</span>, right in front of his wife.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1213">Q: Because of his efforts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1215">A: Because of his support of the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1216">You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts of money to be able to feed and clothe his children.</sentence><sentence id="1217">And he didn't have anything, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1218">And so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had left him as president of the <span class="BUILDING">national bank</span> knowing that he was not, he didn't like them.</sentence><sentence id="1219">So, he went to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I don't remember how much it was, every month.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And my other uncle, one of my other uncles by marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> every month and kept the books.</sentence><sentence id="1221">Kept the accounting.</sentence><sentence id="1222">And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: I do want to learn a lot more about this whole rescue effort, but I'd like you to tell me a bit more about what you did.</sentence><sentence id="1232">Your involvement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement.</sentence><sentence id="1236">All I ever did, as I told you in this film before, is carry little letters and escort children from one <span class="NPIP">point</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="1237">I was too young to do anything else at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1238">So, that was my contribution, if you want, being a messenger.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1247">Q: Do you remember specifics of some of your messengering and escorting?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1283">A: Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually.</sentence><sentence id="1284">At first, we didn't really know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Certainly not before 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And even in 1942, early in the game, we were only sensing something was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1287">And it was very important.</sentence><sentence id="1288">But, we couldn't pinpoint what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1289">But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war, there are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive.</sentence><sentence id="1290">And it didn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and two together and began to realize how important it was.</sentence><sentence id="1291">And what was the purpose of all these kids coming and going.</sentence><sentence id="1292">And some I would never see again, some I would see again, maybe two or three months later.</sentence><sentence id="1293">That would be when a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> would be blown for example, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1294">Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back.</sentence><sentence id="1295">People were talking or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1296">Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my little six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can perceive already.</sentence><sentence id="1297">So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people thought we were.</sentence><sentence id="1298">Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1607">A: Not specifically aimed at Father Bruno's network.</sentence><sentence id="1608">More like the general population.</sentence><sentence id="1609">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1610">For example, we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I didn't like the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but that's neither here nor there, it used to belong, a hundred years ago, no a hundred and fifty years ago, to twin brothers who were wine merchants and they had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> that were two level <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>, like in a <span class="INT_SPACE">sub-basement</span>, if you want, <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">sub-basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1611">All of these were vaulted, almost like a <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1612">And because of that, we had the visit of the air defense people who came and looked at our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they said, well, this is a pretty safe <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">It can probably resist most of the normal bombs that were available in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1614">Would you be willing to open that up to the public?</sentence><sentence id="1615">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="1616">And so, yes there were numbers of people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> who would come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun.</sentence><sentence id="1617">Because they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with them our food.</sentence><sentence id="1618">And in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine.</sentence><sentence id="1619">And I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="1620">And there was an air intake, a sort of a column about a foot and a half in diameter which let the <span class="DLF">air</span> in and opened up in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and I was the air raid signaler.</sentence><sentence id="1621">I was in charge of listening if 1 could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And also to warn them when it was the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1623">That was my duty at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1624">So, this is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid.</sentence><sentence id="1625">And other than that, well, yeah, distributing whatever little food we had to some other people who had even less.</sentence><sentence id="1626">My mother did that, but she did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And my great aunt, who was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Took me around a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1629">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1630">But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1631">That was mostly just ordinary being nice to people.</sentence><sentence id="1632">Oh, I might mention that even though my wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish resistance in their <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1633">That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them also got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> when, you know, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where everyone knew everything about everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1634">So, what they did, they waited until it was dark, called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, had my wife's sister climb on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and took the whole thing to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1635">So, of course, my sister- in-law had to stay away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for at least a week because they kept people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for at least a week after appendectomy in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1636">And then to bring the man back was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again, they had to be very careful at night.</sentence><sentence id="1637">And there was an asthmatic woman living right across, 3 because those were <span class="BUILDING">row houses</span>, and she would always open her <span class="DLF">window</span> during the night to take a breath of fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="1638">And they had

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1677">A: Who, well.</sentence><sentence id="1678">Father Bruno was the driving force.</sentence><sentence id="1679">The leader.</sentence><sentence id="1680">He was also the person having no children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back.</sentence><sentence id="1681">Whether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were smarter than that.</sentence><sentence id="1682">But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you help me, but I will never mention you or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1683">But he got his mother involved, my grandmother, my father, who was a surgeon.</sentence><sentence id="1684">My younger uncle who was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="1685">My uncle by marriage who was the finance man.</sentence><sentence id="1686">And his three sisters who were nuns.</sentence><sentence id="1687">But, that was only a very small part of the network.</sentence><sentence id="1688">Because he had to have a lot more help than that.</sentence><sentence id="1689">So, he got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="1690">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not.</sentence><sentence id="1691">He did all kinds of visits himself to the <span class="BUILDING">families</span> where he wanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous story of the University professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louvan(ph</span>), <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> who was a devout Catholic and my uncle went to see him and told him all that was happening.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And the man said, you know, I honestly am not aware of this.</sentence><sentence id="1693">But, my duty as a Christian is to help you.</sentence><sentence id="1694">When are you going to bring me a child?</sentence><sentence id="1695">And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting for him.</sentence><sentence id="1696">He said when he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after the war, that no one actually shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> on him.</sentence><sentence id="1697">So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a family or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would consider them as being servants.</sentence><sentence id="1698">And they wouldn't like that.</sentence><sentence id="1699">So, there were a few, but I would say not more than five or six such incidents occurred.</sentence><sentence id="1700">And the vast majority of the people were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="1701">But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved eventually.</sentence><sentence id="1702">Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't know exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three hundred and fifty.</sentence><sentence id="1703">That may be a little too much.</sentence><sentence id="1704">We don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1705">Because, obviously, for security reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1706">So all the records he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then transferred to a more elaborate ledger.</sentence><sentence id="1707">And so he lost track of a few of them.</sentence><sentence id="1708">So we know for sure of about three hundred and twenty.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And since each child probably had to be moved, one, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably something like a thousand transfers.</sentence><sentence id="1710">You know?</sentence><sentence id="1711">Not, there were sometimes the same families taking different children.</sentence><sentence id="1712">But, most of the time they, you know when there was too much talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new families all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1713">And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people of his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that.</sentence><sentence id="1714">Like eight or nine, maybe ten.</sentence><sentence id="1715">Close associates.</sentence><sentence id="1716">But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were involved that should not be forgotten or neglected.</sentence><sentence id="1717">You know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1761">Q: How did he get into this?</sentence><sentence id="1762">What, I mean, yes, he was a good man, but how did he initially get involved with this rescue operation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1765">A: Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to come as a chaplain, in a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the blind in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> called Hodbomo(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1766">And when he got there he discovered that there were some blind children, but that most of the occupants there were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1767">Including the director.</sentence><sentence id="1768">And that, you know, it just, he just saw the light immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1769">But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1770">I told you that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in a busy <span class="DLF">street</span> and he saw people just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone.</sentence><sentence id="1771">And he got closer and he saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black hat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean.</sentence><sentence id="1772">And they were spitting at him and pushing him and that absolutely tore him apart.</sentence><sentence id="1773">But, obviously, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he couldn't do a thing about it.</sentence><sentence id="1774">You know?</sentence><sentence id="1775">He couldn't go to the rescue of the man.</sentence><sentence id="1776">If it had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, he probably would have, but not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">And he never forgot that incident.</sentence><sentence id="1778">And when he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodbomo</span>, that little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the blind, he said, well, now I realize the full impact of what I saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he decided to help.</sentence><sentence id="1779">And he didn't help because they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1780">He helped because they were people.</sentence><sentence id="1781">He said, I don't care if they had been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1782">He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other people, which made it a little easier for him to understand.</sentence><sentence id="1783">But, he was mostly concerned about human beings, about people.</sentence><sentence id="1784">And he said, you know, I have to do something to save those people.</sentence><sentence id="1785">I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people.</sentence><sentence id="1786">They are oppressed.</sentence><sentence id="1787">They are persecuted.</sentence><sentence id="1788">My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them if I can.</sentence><sentence id="1789">Then, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodbomo</span>, he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liesch(ph</span>) and was the executive director of the camps for sickly and destitute children of the archdiocese of Liesch whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1790">And they started working together and Vandenburg was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno who was, you know, free of family, in a way.</sentence><sentence id="1791">Didn't have any children and so on, and was willing to do anything to help.</sentence><sentence id="1792">And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1793">At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction of the military government.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And he was condemned to three months in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and he was very happy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that.</sentence><sentence id="1795">And he got out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the Gestapo was waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1796">Took him again.</sentence><sentence id="1797">Sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> where he finally, well, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> of typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1798">Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a deadly disease.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network by contacting various people.</sentence><sentence id="1800">Some of the people he already knew from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because they were helpers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and this way he was able to place a few children.</sentence><sentence id="1801">But, the first month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to mention that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became very unsafe because in the village people began talking, I'm sure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And talking, as I said, is very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1803">You know, the enemy has ears everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1804">So, the first thing that Father 5 Bruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1805">So right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1806">So they placed those, the early ones, they placed in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> or, again, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1807">But even that became unsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids, there were some adults who were also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they were arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1808">One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the name of Lepkifka(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1809">And he escaped but his parents went to and died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1810">And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vandenburg</span> and...I'm sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1857">Q: That's okay, let it go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1859">A: What's up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1861">Q: It's okay, continue please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1863">A: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="1864">You know, to publicize the work of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vandenburg</span> and, incidentally, of Father Bruno as well.</sentence><sentence id="1865">They knew each other quite well.</sentence><sentence id="1866">As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi who was very broad minded at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="1867">So, that did a lot to smooth any possible differences that might have occurred under his guidance.</sentence><sentence id="1868">And then you, I think you were asking me how he got to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Well, then people heard about his work and they came with requests, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1870">Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in safety.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them.</sentence><sentence id="1872">Eventually after a few months, I think it was in July of "43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a month.</sentence><sentence id="1873">That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> across <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring the child.</sentence><sentence id="1874">It was a day and night job.</sentence><sentence id="1875">You know, he worked 18 hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And sometimes more.</sentence><sentence id="1877">He said after the war that he had crisscrossed <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> 40 times the distance that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle racers</span> do for the tour of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="1878">So, that give you an idea of how much <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycling</span> he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1895">Q: What was the involvement of the, or support of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1897">A: Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, as opposed to some of the <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span>, the majority of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1898">The Cardinal, the Primate of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, Cardinal VanLouie(ph), had directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious.</sentence><sentence id="1899">But he did several times, issue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this.</sentence><sentence id="1900">I will do, I will not interfere if you do that.</sentence><sentence id="1901">In other words, he was giving them free rein without saying, I want you to save the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1902">Because that would immediately have put him in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> right there.</sentence><sentence id="1903">And he couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1904">And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius XXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my parents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he became the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that the Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> itself saved 6 around 20,000 Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1905">Including the Grand Rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> who was at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vatican</span> during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1906">Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because he didn't do enough.</sentence><sentence id="1907">But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different <span class="NPIP">angles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1908">It, there is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1909">And take the Pope prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1910">He couldn't have done anything any more at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1911">So, in other words, what he did in a concealed way, was probably more useful than if he had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it.</sentence><sentence id="1912">They said he was a friend of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1913">Yes, that's true.</sentence><sentence id="1914">He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> for several years and he really liked the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1915">But, he abhorred Nazism.</sentence><sentence id="1916">In fact, one of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without reservation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1937">Q: One of the reasons I'm asking about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in particular is that as we know in many instances, there was a, there were traditional beliefs about Jewish people as traitors, as Christ killers, as whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was not always as supportive toward helping Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1941">A: Well, you know, let's say that in my environment, it wasn't the case.</sentence><sentence id="1942">I cannot speak for all the Belgians, but in my environment, it was not the case.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And from what I've been reading and from what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> than, for example, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1944">Because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, even now, there is still a great hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1945">Let's face it.</sentence><sentence id="1946">That was not the case in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1947">It was not the case in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, either.</sentence><sentence id="1948">I want to say here that we never knew exactly how many Jews were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> because people were not registered as to their race, religion, creed or anything else.</sentence><sentence id="1949">We figure that there were probably, including all the refugees from the east, in 1938, "39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something like 70,000.</sentence><sentence id="1950">Only about 30,000 survived.</sentence><sentence id="1951">And that was better than <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1952">Where only, I think, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived.</sentence><sentence id="1953">So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were.</sentence><sentence id="1954">They had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic.</sentence><sentence id="1955">Very sad, tragic.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1973">7 Tape #5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1975">Q: In this rescue network of your uncle's, who, was he involved with organizations?</sentence><sentence id="1976">Did he get help or finances from different resistance organizations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1979">A: As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation.</sentence><sentence id="1980">He did have assistants.</sentence><sentence id="1981">He had people helping him find <span class="BUILDING">families</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1982">He had people taking care of false identification papers and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1983">But as far as administration, he was it.</sentence><sentence id="1984">He had all the power and all the responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="1985">As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his possessions were on his body.</sentence><sentence id="1986">That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="1987">He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were willing to contribute.</sentence><sentence id="1988">But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the .</sentence><sentence id="1989">The largest <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> whose director we called governor in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1990">Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1991">And he committed himself to contributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="1992">It may not have been quite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Mr.Gallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack Dupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1994">Another uncle of mine.</sentence><sentence id="1995">And he continued doing that until the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="1996">Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of Nazi thugs who one day came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan?</sentence><sentence id="1997">And he said, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1998">And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front of his wife.</sentence><sentence id="1999">But the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> continued honoring his commitment all the way to the end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2023">Q: What about other organizations such as the Jewish Defense Committee?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2025">A: Well, there was, of course, the CDJ, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the initials are the same in English as in French, .</sentence><sentence id="2026">Who was very active and collaborated very closely with Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="2027">The problem with that is, like it was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, some of the leaders of that group were, how shall I say, were persuaded by the Germans to cooperate with them.</sentence><sentence id="2028">But, of course, the ultimate idea was not at all cooperation, it was to get all the information they could get.</sentence><sentence id="2029">And so, Father Bruno was a little bit reluctant to associate directly with the CDJ because he knew there were files and reams of paper that could be found and were found by the Gestapo leading to the arrest of quite a number of people.</sentence><sentence id="2030">Fortunately, most of the members of CDJ escaped death.</sentence><sentence id="2031">Several went to various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but they didn't die.</sentence><sentence id="2032">One of them was Mrs. Jospa(ph) who was one of the closest collaborators of Father Bruno and is still alive now, as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="2033">And there were several others who were both in the armed resistance and in the peaceful resistance.</sentence><sentence id="2034">Because Father Bruno always said, I'm going to be resistance, but I'm going to be a peaceful resistance.</sentence><sentence id="2035">I will never bear arms.</sentence><sentence id="2036">Which he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2037">But some of the actual armed resistance did cooperate with the peaceful resistance for various reasons and there were several of those, one of them was killed in action and another one died, I believe, after the liberation in an unfortunate accident, in the army at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2053">Q: What sort of coordination would there have been between this committee and your Uncle's network?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2055">A: The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly.</sentence><sentence id="2056">They were, the CDJ had visitors, or visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And they would report to the CDJ, but also to Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="2058">And the CDJ had a committee that was specifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed.</sentence><sentence id="2059">But that was precisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared.</sentence><sentence id="2060">That there was too much documentation.</sentence><sentence id="2061">And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any written documentation, without papers.</sentence><sentence id="2062">He would handle only cash, never checks.</sentence><sentence id="2063">Or just, you know, items, like butter or meat or something.</sentence><sentence id="2064">But he would not use things that could be traced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2065">He would meet with the representatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written of their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest.</sentence><sentence id="2066">Then they kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records.</sentence><sentence id="2067">Not that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone.</sentence><sentence id="2068">So, they didn't put his name on the records.</sentence><sentence id="2069">This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I was at that meeting.</sentence><sentence id="2070">And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it.</sentence><sentence id="2071">And, but that was deliberate.</sentence><sentence id="2072">So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="2073">And in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2074">It wasn't, you know, like in an army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2075">It was a loose cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="2076">They would have meetings that were informal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of the network.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2101">A: There was some Protestants but, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> has very few Protestants actually.</sentence><sentence id="2102">But there were several Protestant ministers involved.</sentence><sentence id="2103">Indeed.</sentence><sentence id="2104">But to go back to the Catholic clergy.</sentence><sentence id="2105">There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="2106">One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know, at the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namir</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2107">And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences.</sentence><sentence id="2108">Father Bruno did not have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where he could, you know, which he could call his base.</sentence><sentence id="2109">Until a spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she had on the square in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2110">Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented.</sentence><sentence id="2111">It was a very small <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2112">On the left side was a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> with horse betting, what do you call that?</sentence><sentence id="2113">You know what I mean.</sentence><sentence id="2114">Anyway, horse betting.</sentence><sentence id="2115">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a of the SS, who was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2116">But that turned out, again, to be a sort of a protection.</sentence><sentence id="2117">Because he was right next to this important Nazi officer and they never ever considered the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in between there.</sentence><sentence id="2118">And the second coincidence, Father Andre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namir</span> had, on his left, a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> with horse betting and on his right a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German army.</sentence><sentence id="2119">Can you imagine a more bizarre coincidence than that?</sentence><sentence id="2120">Father Andre did an awful lot 9 of work and he deserves all the credit.</sentence><sentence id="2121">I think he is on the list at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, also.</sentence><sentence id="2122">Deserves all the credit.</sentence><sentence id="2123">And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught.</sentence><sentence id="2124">There were many other priests, I won't give you all the names.</sentence><sentence id="2125">First of all, I can't remember them right now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old Belgian family who was a pastor of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2126">He, too, took care of several kids.</sentence><sentence id="2127">He was a friend of my father's actually.</sentence><sentence id="2128">And there were quite a number of other clergymen.</sentence><sentence id="2129">And nuns, of course, too.</sentence><sentence id="2130">Flora Singer was hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">convent of nuns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2131">It wasn't always a pleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life.</sentence><sentence id="2132">Very strict and during the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share what food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were hidden there.</sentence><sentence id="2133">So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of being cold in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because the central heating wasn't working.</sentence><sentence id="2134">There was no coal.</sentence><sentence id="2135">And at that time, central heating was mostly coal fired.</sentence><sentence id="2136">We didn't have any oil.</sentence><sentence id="2137">Even if it had been oil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway.</sentence><sentence id="2138">So, yeah, the conditions were not always pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="2139">But, what's the alternative?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2179">Q: When you mention the scarcity of food or coal, how did your uncle and his colleagues get enough food or clothing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2181">A: You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2182">To get enough food and clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2183">Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and maybe a little more than just enough.</sentence><sentence id="2184">That was only a small part.</sentence><sentence id="2185">I think most of the sources were actually legal sources done illegally.</sentence><sentence id="2186">In other words, there was, for example, the wife of the same professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Louvan(ph</span>) who at night went, would you believe, to burglarize the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of rationing, the rationing department.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And stole reams of food stamps.</sentence><sentence id="2188">Now, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with them.</sentence><sentence id="2189">That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="2190">So, they had to forge food cards.</sentence><sentence id="2191">And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father Bruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards.</sentence><sentence id="2192">Strangely enough, one of the best forgers was an old monk in Father Bruno's <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span>, , very, very adorable old father who would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father Bruno that he was doing humanitarian work.</sentence><sentence id="2193">He said, I can't be a forger.</sentence><sentence id="2194">But, he did and he was probably the best of all.</sentence><sentence id="2195">So, they forged hundreds of food cards.</sentence><sentence id="2196">They also had to forge identity cards to go along with food cards because, unlike the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, most <span class="REGION">European countries</span> demand that their citizens bear an identity card on them all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2197">At least after age 12.</sentence><sentence id="2198">So, you know, they had to, we had to forge identity cards with false names, false places of birth and false dates of birth so that nothing could be traced.</sentence><sentence id="2199">One time Father Bruno was at an open <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, there was an open <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and he was looking, I think, for old clothes or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2200">And he had his briefcase with him full of blank identity cards.</sentence><sentence id="2201">And, sure enough, as he walked away, there was a check point with two , who were there and were searching peoples suitcases as well as checking the papers.</sentence><sentence id="2202">And he had a false identity card himself which said that he was an employee of the government.</sentence><sentence id="2203">And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was taking work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he needed to finish some cards for the next day.</sentence><sentence id="2204">And they let him 0 go.</sentence><sentence id="2205">Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen.</sentence><sentence id="2206">But they did.</sentence><sentence id="2207">That was one of his close escapes.</sentence><sentence id="2208">He had a few more, but that was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="2209">And, so, ration cards, food stamps, stolen.</sentence><sentence id="2210">It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, it was almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="2211">You had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were stolen, they were not falsified.</sentence><sentence id="2212">Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then they filled in the name by hand.</sentence><sentence id="2213">So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult to falsify a card as long as you had one of the city rubber stamps or one of those embossing stamps.</sentence><sentence id="2214">That worked.</sentence><sentence id="2215">If you were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="2216">There was always a problem because, you know, you had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often happen in the SS, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their signature.</sentence><sentence id="2217">You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they could have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the falsification.</sentence><sentence id="2218">So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do you call it, a welfare check.</sentence><sentence id="2219">But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced.</sentence><sentence id="2220">Most of the time the money, as I said, came either from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> or from private contributions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2261">Q: Did he have cohorts in <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2263">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2264">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2265">He had, fortunately, many, many of the Belgian civil service employees were faithful, were reliable.</sentence><sentence id="2266">They were anti-German and he knew which were and which were not.</sentence><sentence id="2267">He had a number of helpers, mostly in the municipal governments where it was most important.</sentence><sentence id="2268">Because that's where the stamps and the cards were issued.</sentence><sentence id="2269">One day he went in this particular <span class="BUILDING">municipal office</span> where he had an appointment with the assistant chief and a lady seemed to be in a hurry and, because he was very courteous, he said, okay, go in first.</sentence><sentence id="2270">She went in, took her time, and he saw two people just babbling or talking about various papers there and then it was his turn and one of the guys walked away, went away.</sentence><sentence id="2271">Picked up his suitcase, his briefcase, and went away.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And when he got near the assistant chief, he said, you don't know, but I'm sweating here.</sentence><sentence id="2273">That man who just left was from the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="2274">If you had come in at your turn instead of letting the lady go in first, we would have been both caught.</sentence><sentence id="2275">So, another close escape.</sentence><sentence id="2276">But, this was help he got from the civil service or the employees of the government, various governments.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2291">Q: Were most of these people who helped him motivated by working with Father Bruno, anti- German, or really motivated to rescue Jewish children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: I think all three.</sentence><sentence id="2294">I think it varied on the person.</sentence><sentence id="2295">You may even add one.</sentence><sentence id="2296">Money.</sentence><sentence id="2297">Because many rescuers were given money.</sentence><sentence id="2298">And during the war, money was very tight.</sentence><sentence id="2299">And some people would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2300">But, I would say, all three.</sentence><sentence id="2301">Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Charisma from Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="2303">And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal for money at times.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2315">Q: What other aspects of the logistics were very difficult?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2319">A: Transportation.</sentence><sentence id="2320">Not to be caught.</sentence><sentence id="2321">Because some kids had to be transported from one end of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="2322">And even though <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> is a small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, that still represented 200 miles sometimes and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> during the war were extremely slow and rare.</sentence><sentence id="2323">And so, it may have taken a whole day to do 200 miles by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2324">You know, getting the children registered in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> with a false ID card.</sentence><sentence id="2325">It was difficult unless you had cooperation from the local authorities.</sentence><sentence id="2326">And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have help from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> would be either scared or maybe even pro-German.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And they would get wind of the thing and immediately the child would have to be moved away.</sentence><sentence id="2328">That was one of the logistical difficulties, too.</sentence><sentence id="2329">And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't just barge in those <span class="BUILDING">municipal offices</span> and pick your choice of stamps.</sentence><sentence id="2330">You know, it had to be done extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the employee who would leave the <span class="DLF">door</span> open, for example.</sentence><sentence id="2331">Not lock the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2332">And pretend to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as usual.</sentence><sentence id="2333">And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and steal.</sentence><sentence id="2334">And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2335">Perhaps less difficult than the food cards.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Logistics.</sentence><sentence id="2337">Getting clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2338">Getting a child registered in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because these kids had to continue their education during the war.</sentence><sentence id="2339">I mean, they couldn't just stay for a year or even two years without any schooling.</sentence><sentence id="2340">So, to have them accepted in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not all that hard, but, there were school inspections and the authorities, the occupant authorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come from?</sentence><sentence id="2341">So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell the Jewish child to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or another child to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or another child.</sentence><sentence id="2342">You know, the teacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2343">And the kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here?</sentence><sentence id="2344">Well, we think he may have a cold, keep him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a day or two.</sentence><sentence id="2345">So, that would bring the number back to normal.</sentence><sentence id="2346">There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language problem.</sentence><sentence id="2347">Quite a number of these kids were from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2348">And even the Belgian Jews sometimes spoke Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And one incident occurred in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the Waloon(ph) part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and the school inspector came who was, unfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids was there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French?</sentence><sentence id="2350">And the kid said, yeah, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2351">Alright do you speak other languages?</sentence><sentence id="2352">Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish.</sentence><sentence id="2353">And then the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2354">Oh, Yiddish. [</sentence><sentence id="2355">sharp intake of breath] That was it.</sentence><sentence id="2356">He gave it away.</sentence><sentence id="2357">But, apparently, as far as I know, the child did not get taken.</sentence><sentence id="2358">Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately before the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another crew to arrest him and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2359">Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible, you know, passed away without any major trouble.</sentence><sentence id="2360">But, you never know, little children, even though they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control.</sentence><sentence id="2361">A little girl in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice gentleman across from her on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">And he said, what's your name?</sentence><sentence id="2363">And she said, do you want my real name or the other?</sentence><sentence id="2364">And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not sympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="2365">But, see how, you know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning.</sentence><sentence id="2366">2 3 Tape #6</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2415">Q: Other logistical consideration or challenges?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2417">A: Like what happens in an emergency, for example.</sentence><sentence id="2418">Well, there really wasn't any set system.</sentence><sentence id="2419">Again, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you call this person, in that case, you call that person.</sentence><sentence id="2420">It was strictly a word of mouth affair.</sentence><sentence id="2421">And one person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find, please find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, as soon as he gets there, tell him there is an emergency.</sentence><sentence id="2422">And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to do in that particular case.</sentence><sentence id="2423">One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl who, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2424">She had not been deported.</sentence><sentence id="2425">She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I have to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were.</sentence><sentence id="2426">Most of the time they were not told.</sentence><sentence id="2427">Obviously, again, for security reasons.</sentence><sentence id="2428">For obvious security reasons.</sentence><sentence id="2429">Well anyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that she took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two or three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker.</sentence><sentence id="2430">And she was hoping to sell those to pay for her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> trip.</sentence><sentence id="2431">She walked into a purse, what do you call those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> where they sell purses?</sentence><sentence id="2432">In French they call them .</sentence><sentence id="2433">Anyway, she went in and offered her purses for sale to the man who, I think he even bought them.</sentence><sentence id="2434">The man was one of the representatives of the Flemish pro-German group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2435">So, the mother went to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> which was strictly forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="2436">And the sisters, in a panic, called two or three persons and the chain got into operation and the little girl was taken away after she did see her mother, I have to say, to a secret other <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the sisters simply had to give up keeping Jewish girls because the mother had told this man why she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2437">You know, sometimes people's brains don't function too well.</sentence><sentence id="2438">But, anyway, that kind of emergency occurred a fair number of times.</sentence><sentence id="2439">One time, again you can read that if you want in the biography, there were three kids who were in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish children which was completely under German control.</sentence><sentence id="2440">And Father Bruno wanted those kids to escape.</sentence><sentence id="2441">And, well to make a long story short, he arranged for them to have diphtheria, quote unquote, and they were immediately transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because of a call, again through the chain, saying that, well, the Germans were terribly afraid of diphtheria, they had to take those contagious children out of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and isolate them.</sentence><sentence id="2442">So they did that.</sentence><sentence id="2443">And, again the chain worked, when they were so called cured, they never had been sick in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, Mrs.Ruspa(ph) and a couple of other people took the three children, made a release letter in three copies, gave one to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, mailed one to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because the Germans had said, now it's time to go get those children, and have the doctor release them.</sentence><sentence id="2444">Well, they mailed one, but in the meantime, before the mail got to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which would take at least 24 hours, the children were far away and they kept the third release copy.</sentence><sentence id="2445">This was one of the most movie- like episodes because they had to enlist the help of the doctors, of the nurses, of the bacteriologist who falsified the cultures.</sentence><sentence id="2446">Of the bacteriologist, again, who had to say they were cured.</sentence><sentence id="2447">Of the person who made the release letter, who said they could be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="2448">And knew perfectly well they were not going to be picked up because they were already 4 gone.</sentence><sentence id="2449">You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it.</sentence><sentence id="2450">But, nothing failed, everything worked fine.</sentence><sentence id="2451">What other logistical things were we talking about, again?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2488">Q: Well, I'm sort of curious.</sentence><sentence id="2489">This may be a dumb question, but, how did people find Father Bruno and how did he find families to take care of the children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2492">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2493">Well, how did they find Father Bruno?</sentence><sentence id="2494">Occasionally, through the CDJ, but most of the time a simple word of mouth.</sentence><sentence id="2495">Mrs. Abraham on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> would talk to Sarah on the other <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little daughter and hid her.</sentence><sentence id="2496">You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find you.</sentence><sentence id="2497">Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter.</sentence><sentence id="2498">And they would do that.</sentence><sentence id="2499">Family members.</sentence><sentence id="2500">Sometimes out of the blue.</sentence><sentence id="2501">He would never know where or how those people would have got his name.</sentence><sentence id="2502">Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally unknown person got my name, who else got my name?</sentence><sentence id="2503">And, as a matter of fact, there was one time when he was going in one of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> to go collect a little boy, I think, and as he was turning the corner, he saw a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> stopping in front there and he knew that was the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="2504">And they got the boy.</sentence><sentence id="2505">He never had the boy.</sentence><sentence id="2506">He never had this child, didn't put his hand on the child once.</sentence><sentence id="2507">But, they got the child.</sentence><sentence id="2508">That was very sad.</sentence><sentence id="2509">That was one of his most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten the child yet.</sentence><sentence id="2510">But, someone had babbled and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2511">Then, we were talking about emotional issues.</sentence><sentence id="2512">That was a big problem.</sentence><sentence id="2513">Many of these children, of course, didn't want to leave their parents.</sentence><sentence id="2514">Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and they would try to make do.</sentence><sentence id="2515">The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones, it was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle.</sentence><sentence id="2516">Particularly for Father Bruno who had never had any children of his own.</sentence><sentence id="2517">And this was one of the reasons why he was known to keep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2518">In addition to looking for new <span class="NPIP">places</span>, he kept track of the old <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2519">And one of the most intimate friends of Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers who are now in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2520">And they describe when he would come to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where they were hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come with green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers.</sentence><sentence id="2521">With green knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that?</sentence><sentence id="2522">Well, I'm not Father Bruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so.</sentence><sentence id="2523">He had several identities.</sentence><sentence id="2524">And his last identity was Msr.</sentence><sentence id="2525">Renau(ph), you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Renau</span> in French means fox.</sentence><sentence id="2526">And it was kind of play on words, of course, because he out-foxed them all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2527">And he said, no, I am Msr.</sentence><sentence id="2528">Renau, you don't know me as Father Bruno any more.</sentence><sentence id="2529">And he would visit them as often as he could.</sentence><sentence id="2530">But, of course, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day.</sentence><sentence id="2531">But, he would keep track precisely for those emotional reasons.</sentence><sentence id="2532">Because he had a charisma and he inspired confidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand.</sentence><sentence id="2533">And they would really get very, very attached to him.</sentence><sentence id="2534">And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed their anxieties.</sentence><sentence id="2535">And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better.</sentence><sentence id="2536">He made a big point of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2584">Q: How do you find all of these families who would harbor the children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2586">A: Well, again, it's word of mouth.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And occasionally, as we said before, by the CDJ, the Committee for the Defense of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2588">Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk to those people.</sentence><sentence id="2589">Like the University professor I mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="2590">He would just go in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and say, I want you to help.</sentence><sentence id="2591">And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say no.</sentence><sentence id="2592">You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do is say, now, you're going to have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2593">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="2594">You know.</sentence><sentence id="2595">Both my sister and my brother and I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this.</sentence><sentence id="2596">And we would do it.</sentence><sentence id="2597">Even if we had been very bad with our parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2610">Q: But I mean, isn't there a whole issue of trust?</sentence><sentence id="2611">In just approaching people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2614">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2615">Well, he approached people after, you know, carefully selecting them.</sentence><sentence id="2616">People he knew were trustworthy and people he had known for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="2617">His close friends.</sentence><sentence id="2618">Or people who were guaranteed by others.</sentence><sentence id="2619">There was always a risk.</sentence><sentence id="2620">There was always a risk.</sentence><sentence id="2621">Accepting a Jewish child from a family was a risk.</sentence><sentence id="2622">Not for the Germans, where the Germans were concerned.</sentence><sentence id="2623">But what if that person was a traitor?</sentence><sentence id="2624">What if the child was not Jewish and was just being used as a, you know, a trap.</sentence><sentence id="2625">You know?</sentence><sentence id="2626">There was always a risk.</sentence><sentence id="2627">But, for some reason, he must have had, he must have been a good judge of character, because the only time he almost got caught was when this dreadful traitor, so called Captain Jackson who was not a Captain Jackson, he was a Belgian by the name of Bziter(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2628">Convened a so called resistance group and he refused to go because he smelled a rat.</sentence><sentence id="2629">And all the people who went, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2630">And he didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="2631">Because he smelled a rat.</sentence><sentence id="2632">So, you know, he had a sixth sense that made him know when people were genuine or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2652">Q: Was this the time when there were arrests at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mossesar(ph</span>)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2654">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="2655">That was, these arrests were made in Male(ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2656">Male(ph) Mechalen(ph) which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2657">No.</sentence><sentence id="2658">And there were several of his assistants who went there and they got caught.</sentence><sentence id="2659">But I don't think they died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2660">But, that's neither here nor there, I mean, they could have.</sentence><sentence id="2661">They were trapped by this traitor who was shot after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2662">He was condemned by a <span class="BUILDING">military court</span> and shot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2672">Q: Wasn't there some close call at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mossesar</span>, as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2674">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2675">Well, that was early in the game, actually.</sentence><sentence id="2676">Early in the game when he was only beginning his <span class="BUILDING">network</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2677">He was still at the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> and they came and searched the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mossesar</span> from top to bottom.</sentence><sentence id="2678">He managed to hide a bunch of papers in a <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and, again, those numskulls didn't even think of looking in there.</sentence><sentence id="2679">But, he hid them in a secret <span class="DLF">door</span> or trap in the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and they never found anything.</sentence><sentence id="2680">But that's when the superior of the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span> said, listen, I have 80 monks here and their my responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="2681">I can't have you have your base of work, I approve of what you're doing, but I can't let you have your base here at the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2682">Because the next time they come, they will find something and we'll all go to 6 Bruckenvald(ph) or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2683">And, so, that's when he moved out of the <span class="BUILDING">abbey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2684">But that was still fairly early in the game, that was in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="2685">And he then rented a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luvan(ph</span>) and that became unsafe, too.</sentence><sentence id="2686">And he then rented another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, which he kept for a few months.</sentence><sentence id="2687">And then came the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from that lady between the and the <span class="BUILDING">horse betting institution</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2703">Q: Did he have any time for traditional religious practice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2705">A: Well, he was given dispensation from mandatory celebration of Mass every Sunday by his superiors.</sentence><sentence id="2706">They realized that he couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="2707">But, whenever he had a chance, he would go to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> he had a tiny little alter which he built himself and he would celebrate Mass for us there.</sentence><sentence id="2708">That's one of the very vivid memories I keep of all of us, you know, really tightly packed in that tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and him just having barely <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to turn around and speak to us.</sentence><sentence id="2709">That I remember very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="2710">So, he did as much as he could but it's quite obvious that sometimes he had to do without.</sentence><sentence id="2711">You know, if on Sunday morming he had an emergency, well, that went before celebrating Mass. And he had permission not to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2719">Q: How did you feel as you learned more about this, probably afterwards, about being involved in this incredible network?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2721">A: Afterwards, after the war when I was old enough to really grasp the danger and the risk, I was terrified.</sentence><sentence id="2722">I said, my gosh, we did all that?</sentence><sentence id="2723">And then when that time passed, I said, why, I'm very happy we did.</sentence><sentence id="2724">I felt very good.</sentence><sentence id="2725">I said, well, I didn't do much, but at least I was part of that and I'm so proud of having his name, bearing his name.</sentence><sentence id="2726">You know, that's something that is, it remains with you all your life because not so many people are given that opportunity to help.</sentence><sentence id="2727">And to do it willingly.</sentence><sentence id="2728">That, now I shouldn't be overly proud because I did so little, but when I think of my family, I'm still pretty proud.</sentence><sentence id="2729">You know, we all took risks, especially the adults, they risked their lives of course, and there were close calls.</sentence><sentence id="2730">We were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="2731">I guess we were blessed in our efforts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2743">Q: What happened at the time of liberation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2745">A: I'm not so sure.</sentence><sentence id="2746">I don't want to elaborate too much on that because there were some slightly unpleasant moments.</sentence><sentence id="2747">Most of them were very happy moments.</sentence><sentence id="2748">Kids finding remainders of their families.</sentence><sentence id="2749">There were very sad moments in that happiness because they knew that their parents and grandparents had died.</sentence><sentence id="2750">But they were happy to return to a family.</sentence><sentence id="2751">Some people didn't even, some kids didn't have a family to go back to.</sentence><sentence id="2752">Some of them were kept in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> where they were and they were in slightly better condition because the rationing was over.</sentence><sentence id="2753">And some of them stayed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2754">Some of them had requested to be baptized, but that, oh, I want to insist on this point.</sentence><sentence id="2755">This is a point that Father Bruno was extraordinarily touchy about.</sentence><sentence id="2756">He absolutely refused to put any pressure on any Jewish child to change his religion.</sentence><sentence id="2757">To convert, quote unquote.</sentence><sentence id="2758">That he was adamant about.</sentence><sentence id="2759">He said we are to save them, but their souls do not belong to us.</sentence><sentence id="2760">That was one of his principles.</sentence><sentence id="2761">And, but some of them who were, you know, exposed to the liturgy and to maybe some slightly, you 7 know, warmer person in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>, wanted to, there were about five or six of them who wanted to be baptized and that was a big point of contention.</sentence><sentence id="2762">Because he actually did not want to baptize them unless he had the total guarantee that first of all, the parents wanted it if they were still alive.</sentence><sentence id="2763">Second, that they would have accepted it if they, none of them did, but had previously made that allowance or permission if you want, and that his superiors were in agreement, too.</sentence><sentence id="2764">And I think there were about five out of the 320 or something who were baptized and I think, two or maybe three remained in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2765">The other two just went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2766">And he found that fine.</sentence><sentence id="2767">He said, first of all, you weren't totally adult, you were not sure what you were doing.</sentence><sentence id="2768">Now you saw your fellow Jews and you wanted to be more close to them, fine, go back, that's alright.</sentence><sentence id="2769">He never, never put any <span class="DLF">obstacle</span> to that.</sentence><sentence id="2770">And he always refused to put pressure.</sentence><sentence id="2771">Now, I won't say that there wasn't an occasional old crotchety nun who thought that being non-Christian was the worst sin in the world.</sentence><sentence id="2772">And may have put some pressure on some of the kids, that's possible.</sentence><sentence id="2773">That is, I'm not denying that.</sentence><sentence id="2774">Neither did Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="2775">But, it was against his will and, actually, there is no record that any of those actually did change, so it was just an annoyance and was a little child abuse, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="2776">Moral child abuse.</sentence><sentence id="2777">Which he certainly didn't approve of.</sentence><sentence id="2778">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2779">I digress now.</sentence><sentence id="2780">What were you asking me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2817">Q: We were talking about the difficulties after liberation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2819">A: Right, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="2820">It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving parents, if there were any.</sentence><sentence id="2821">To find surviving family.</sentence><sentence id="2822">Uncles, cousins, if there were any.</sentence><sentence id="2823">And to find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available.</sentence><sentence id="2824">Some of the kids, even though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored them during the war.</sentence><sentence id="2825">That became a little difficult because the CDJ, after the war, tried to gather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which is fine, I mean, it was a legitimate concern of them.</sentence><sentence id="2826">The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="2827">And some members of the CDJ wanted some of the kids to go there.</sentence><sentence id="2828">But Father Bruno said, I don't want that.</sentence><sentence id="2829">I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want them to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them religion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to practice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so.</sentence><sentence id="2830">And that was one of the points of contention.</sentence><sentence id="2831">Unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="2832">Another point of contention was some of the relatives who wanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed.</sentence><sentence id="2833">And I have, unfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my younger uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was staying there, without permission from anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="2834">Not even the CDJ, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="2835">You know.</sentence><sentence id="2836">They just came and took the child.</sentence><sentence id="2837">Not knowing if the parents were alive or what.</sentence><sentence id="2838">They just wanted the kid.</sentence><sentence id="2839">And they didn't even live in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2840">There were a few unpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of these children went pretty smoothly.</sentence><sentence id="2841">Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who made a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the, I forget the new name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the CDJ, it's the same.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2867">Q: So, Father Bruno's work didn't end at liberation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
