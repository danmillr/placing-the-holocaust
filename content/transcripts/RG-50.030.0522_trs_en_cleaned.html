<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: It was Lore, and nobody can pronounce it the way my mother did, which is Loourie, you see, is the Austrian way to do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: So, it was a very long O.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: In -- and in -- while I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, I was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Lorry</span>, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">But now people ask me how to pronounce it and I say 0-open season, any --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: O -- and what was your date of birth?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: March 8", 1928.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: Now tell me something.</sentence><sentence id="25">This is, for me, somewhat odd way to start, but you wrote a novel about your -- about your experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">Why did you decide to write a novel and not a memoir?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Because I was really less interested in the history than in being a writer.</sentence><sentence id="34">And for many years -- I -- I have written little stories before that, and I came to the point in my 20's when it seemed to me I had no subject.</sentence><sentence id="35">I hadn't been in love, I hadn't died.</sentence><sentence id="36">None of the big events had happened to me, and I wanted to be writing.</sentence><sentence id="37">And it seemed to me that these stories that I did have with -- my experiences were a dime a dozen, everybody knew about them.</sentence><sentence id="38">And then one day I -- when i-in -- in my early days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I had gone to the new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and taken a course in creative writing, and we -- the people in that class had a s -- had a -- had a party.</sentence><sentence id="39">And somebody said to me, how did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence><sentence id="40">And I began to tell my -- my Hitler stories.</sentence><sentence id="41">And there was that silence in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I have since had as a teacher, but hadn't experienced at that time.</sentence><sentence id="42">I thought, gee, wow, I have stories to tell and it a -- and -- and it came to me that these stories were my subject.</sentence><sentence id="43">But again, I wa -- didn't write them because I wanted to -- what I think is now known as bearing witness.</sentence><sentence id="44">I wanted to be writing.</sentence><sentence id="45">And I -- I mean another answer is that as a novelist you can in a way -- it's a cliche, it's a truism, but you can be truer that you can --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: -- by sticking to the facts.</sentence><sentence id="48">Can I give you an example of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: -- how writing as a novelist changed what might be a fact.</sentence><sentence id="51">One of the -- one of the chapters in "Other People's Houses" was about my attraction for awhile to the stories of Christianity.</sentence><sentence id="52">No-Notice that I'm -- it's the stories that attracted me.</sentence><sentence id="53">Now, in the chapter about this in "Other People's Houses", I made it may -- the narrative seems to suggest</sentence><sentence id="55">that it was the people in -- my foster parents at the -- of the time, my foster -- two -- two foster mothers tried to convert me.</sentence><sentence id="56">And when they got to -- when th -- one of them at any rate, read the story, s -- read the book, she wrote me and said, but we never tried to convert you.</sentence><sentence id="57">And I wrote back and said absolutely not, you didn't.</sentence><sentence id="58">But for an -- for a story, to be seduced by a person is more -- is a be -- it's a better story than being seduced by an idea.</sentence><sentence id="59">In fact, it's almost impossible novelisticly to write that.</sentence><sentence id="60">So novels suit me better than history, or biography, or auto-biography.</sentence><sentence id="61">It's a long answer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: No, it's very -- it's very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="77">So is -- is doing an interview somewhat problematic for you because you are not being a novelist now, when I ask you questions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="81">I will try and answer you historically.</sentence><sentence id="82">But I -- as we were saying earlier, once you have actually written something, or even told it a lot, something has happened to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: It -- it becomes overlaid with, I guess a skin.</sentence><sentence id="89">Like an anecdote gets a kind of polish on it that is almost impossible to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: To remove that skin.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: -- to remove that skin and get back.</sentence><sentence id="92">But it's an interesting thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="93">I think it's what one would do in -- in analysis, I think.</sentence><sentence id="94">When you've got -- you -- you go back to -- to the -- to the -- to the -- to the -- I want to say real, but you go back to the -- to the event as it happened, or try to.</sentence><sentence id="95">And that's an interesting -- so this is interesting thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="96">I don't know how -- how well I can unpack what was -- what was wrapped up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Well, we-we'll divide our -- our -- your story into a few <span class="NPIP">parts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">So let's -- we'll go from 28 to 38 bef -- before you actually leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">So when you think about your parents as</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="112">a kid, what is your -- what is your earliest memory of being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>?</sentence><sentence id="113">How -- how far back do you go?</sentence><sentence id="114">Cause you're born in 1928.</sentence><sentence id="115">Are you five, are you four, are you six, eight?</sentence><sentence id="116">Do you have --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Well, once again, as -- as with all those memories, I don't know what are the memories, and what are the stories told me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Mm, mm.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: I suppose not th-the worst degree of bleeder, otherwise he wouldn't have survived, but he's -- he was taking my mother is the story, for a bicycle ride along the [indecipherable] the -- the dia -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> -- I don't know what an [indecipherable] what -- what -- what -- what broke down -- wh-what -- what is -- what is supposed to hold the water in?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="174">Anyhow, it was a long <span class="DLF">road</span>, and they were -- they were riding along it and some partridges -- he saw some partridges and he took his hands off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and clapped and fell off and began to bleed.</sentence><sentence id="175">And I remember we were in my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fischamend</span>, which is some half an hour by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Very close now, 10 minutes now from the modern V-Vienna airport, and th-that my grandfather had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the main square of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, a huge <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, with my grandfather's straggled <span class="BUILDING">store</span> at the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="177">And I remember my parents had their own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> back there.</sentence><sentence id="178">My father -- remember my father flat on -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">He had -- he -- ]-[ remember particular that he was not allowed to have a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, and oddly enough I cannot bear to lie for two seconds without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> under my head.</sentence><sentence id="180">But that -- he -- there was a bucket of ice water next to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with little balls of butter which he was</sentence><sentence id="182">supposed to eat.</sentence><sentence id="183">I don't remem -- I have no idea what kind of a theory that was, but that was -- that's certainly one of my earliest memories of going to see my father lying flat.</sentence><sentence id="184">And it was really from that moment on that he was essentially -- well, in and out of <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is overstating it, but I -- I do remember coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my mother saying, put -- don't take off your coat, we're going to go see Daddy, who was once again in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, always with his head flat on the -- on the -- on the white sheet.</sentence><sentence id="185">My mother was always cooking diet for him.</sentence><sentence id="186">I think one of the -- one of the perhaps mistakes my mother made in her very, very lovely relation with me is to use me as a friend to c -- to -- to co -- to have headaches with and to complain of my father's illness, which stood for a lot of other weakness and incapacity, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: So your -- your relationship to your father never became as close as your relationship with your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: It was not -- my relationship to my father was one of regret, that I was not responding adequately to the affection he had for me.</sentence><sentence id="206">I understood that I was not responding, and I re -- I was sorry for him.</sentence><sentence id="207">So was a g -- and my -- th-the man in my life was my Uncle Paul, who was then --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Not your father.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: -- seven years younger than my mother, who lived with us while he went to the -- to study at the -- at medic -- at the school of medicine, a -- ma -- University of lon -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and lived with us and read stories to me and played the guitar for me and told me about things like -- I remember that he had a professor called Professor Tort -- I mean, Professor Death, and he told me about -- I -- I can't think of the word now, hypo -- hyp --</sentence><sentence id="211">hypnosis.</sentence><sentence id="212">I mean, here I was in my -- about seven years old, learning these fascinating things from my uncle, who would sit by my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span> and tell me -- tell me -- tell me about the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="220">Was your father jealous of Paul?</sentence></p></dialogue>
