<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: And he wasn't your pet mouse?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="8">I don't know where the mouse came from.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Did you have any pets?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: No, I didn't, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hobbies</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: No, not really.</sentence><sentence id="18">By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and the little kids in the <span class="DLF">street</span> very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so there was very little time for hobbies.</sentence><sentence id="19">It was more a question of protection.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Did any of the kids ever beat you up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: You mentioned that there were very few Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I imagine half of them were relatives.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="30">I think we, my brother and I, and another girl were the only children that I can remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: And you had at least one uncle.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Yes, but he didn't live in that same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: No?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="42">Did you ever get to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="46">I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about two years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="47">No, it was two years.</sentence><sentence id="48">Till they prohibited Jewish kids from going to the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">And I was then enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish operated school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">And every morning | had to get up about six and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all by myself to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and in the evening I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">I did this for one or two years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed.</sentence><sentence id="52">One or two years, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: How was it like going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as one of the few Jewish kids?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: I don't have very much memory of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, except that there was a lot of persecution.</sentence><sentence id="64">I was asked to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb.</sentence><sentence id="65">And of course, whenever the kids could catch me</sentence><sentence id="67">they would either push me into the --- some --- the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> that fell up from the <span class="DLF">road</span>, or beat me up otherwise --- anything they could do.</sentence><sentence id="68">Recently, I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">This is an aside.</sentence><sentence id="70">And the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> student, who is 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish community in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and myself and my family, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="72">Things that I didn't know, I had forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="73">And, in fact, he found my school records.</sentence><sentence id="74">And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: You were a terrible student?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Well, it's not surprising.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Or, how did the teachers treat you?</sentence><sentence id="94">That was my next question, anyway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: How what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: How did the teachers treat you?</sentence><sentence id="100">Sometimes people had terrible grades but they were good students.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Well, I really don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="104">I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately.</sentence><sentence id="105">Otherwise I don't think they could teach.</sentence><sentence id="106">And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="107">But I was surprised to find my grades after about 50 years, you know.</sentence><sentence id="108">Wasn't particularly paramount on my mind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: No.</sentence><sentence id="116">Even then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: That piece, his thesis, oh, the book, the research.</sentence><sentence id="122">That would be interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: It's quite amazing.</sentence><sentence id="126">It's quite an experience to meet these Germans.</sentence><sentence id="127">In fact, it's something I'd like to talk to you about later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: The rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, were they, uh, was it more of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protestant town</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: I don't know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20 Protestant, but I can't tell you.</sentence><sentence id="134">There was one <span class="BUILDING">church</span> each, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Did you have any, | hesitate to say friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="140">I don't remember really playing with any particular kids.</sentence><sentence id="141">When you ask that question, the image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to.</sentence><sentence id="142">One of the non-Jewish kids died of something and the whole class, I was still in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, went to the funeral.</sentence><sentence id="143">The first time I've ever been in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">And I vividly remember the open <span class="DLF">grave</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> in it and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I was so scared, I just couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="146">That's all Iremember.</sentence><sentence id="147">Now whether this kid was a particular friend of mine, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="148">I don't have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really having a good time to tell you the truth.</sentence><sentence id="149">I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked.</sentence><sentence id="150">I remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were</sentence><sentence id="152">full of pretty large rocks.</sentence><sentence id="153">These were not paved <span class="DLF">roads</span>, they were <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> with rock over them.</sentence><sentence id="154">And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids would pursue me or they would throw rocks.</sentence><sentence id="155">They were very handy little missiles, you know, pick them off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and start throwing.</sentence><sentence id="156">So my memories were not particularly happy ones in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: These were kids that were roughly your age?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Yeah, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: You didn't have teenagers for example going after you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: No, they didn't bother with me.</sentence><sentence id="184">Not that I remember.</sentence><sentence id="185">I think that some of the older people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we would venture out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, in those days they still had horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="186">I remember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that <span class="DLF">street</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: The whip.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="194">Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">You know, with the whip.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Crack the whip.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Cracking ---</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Cracking the whip in your direction?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: No, not in my direction.</sentence><sentence id="206">He hit me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: He got you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="212">But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: It must have been lonely not having many kids your age that you could play with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: I guess so.</sentence><sentence id="218">I really don't have any strong memories of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: How were you informed that you could no longer go to this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="224">| think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> to continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, just like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Long Island Railroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">And every morning, I would end up on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with a school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my lunch.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Did you know any Nazis?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Well I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was full of them.</sentence><sentence id="234">And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis,</sentence><sentence id="236">more recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year.</sentence><sentence id="237">They threatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: There are Nazis still in hold?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on.</sentence><sentence id="247">But, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action when it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="248">Otherwise, because, presumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I. He had somewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some others.</sentence><sentence id="249">Of course in the final analysis it didn't do him any good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: And your father was in the German army in World War I?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yeah, he was in the German army for four years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: A decorated veteran?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the Gestapo agent when they eventually deported us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: In 1940?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: In 1940.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: "This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran ---</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Is that really ---?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: -- Apparently you were able to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> longer than the other kids.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Was that so?</sentence><sentence id="273">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="274">I see.</sentence><sentence id="275">A little distinction.</sentence><sentence id="276">Yeah, they did make a little distinction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Yes, two or three years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> like most of the males, if not all of them.</sentence><sentence id="285">He was privileged.</sentence><sentence id="286">He was let out four weeks afterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: So he was able to return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after this first trip?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Yeah, what was his crime?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: His crime?</sentence><sentence id="297">I guess being a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Being a Jew, that was it, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: He hadn't done a thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don't know what they are, logical, or if they needed any.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: You remember Kristallnacht fairly well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Yeah, but before we talk about it, I'd like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don't remember what year it was.</sentence><sentence id="314">We lived in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Humfenheim</span>, essentially an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">agricultural town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="316">I mean that's how close they were.</sentence><sentence id="317">And, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">regional town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sinsheim</span> is about four kilometers from there.</sentence><sentence id="318">And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sinsheim</span> I don't remember why, and one of the pleasures along that <span class="DLF">road</span> was that the <span class="DLF">road</span> was lined on both sides with apple <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren't ripe yet.</sentence><sentence id="320">And to this day I love green apples.</sentence><sentence id="321">We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that <span class="DLF">national road</span>, a two-lane road.</sentence><sentence id="322">And we'd take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was speeding by.</sentence><sentence id="323">We would miss most of them but this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, we hit right smack on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the whole apple splattered.</sentence><sentence id="324">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which was on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="325">And the SS guy comes out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="326">Who threw the apple?"</sentence><sentence id="327">And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying.</sentence><sentence id="328">He took our name and didn't say anything more.</sentence><sentence id="329">That night we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and our father says, "I had a call... I was visited by the police.</sentence><sentence id="330">What did you guys do?</sentence><sentence id="331">You were throwing apples." "</sentence><sentence id="332">We weren't throwing apples."</sentence><sentence id="333">And he hit us across the face, I can still...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: You lied to your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: I lied to my father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: He believed the SS over you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Well, I was so scared.</sentence><sentence id="362">I remember that very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="363">So when you say did I encounter any Nazis, well that was a very close encounter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: That's a very close encounter.</sentence><sentence id="368">SS.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: I would guess it was 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: After you had stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: Probably, yeah, probably.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: And you didn't know it was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS car</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: No, no, we would throw apples at any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: You hit the jackpot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="389">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: Did your father have any non-Jewish customers, I would think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: I presume he did, as long as it was all right to buy from a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shop</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: Do you recall how his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> fared after the Nazis came to power?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Well, I think it quickly went to pot, but I don't really remember the details, really, I had very little to do with the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: So you wouldn't know whether there was boycotts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shunning</span> and so on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: No, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="406">I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time.</sentence><sentence id="407">These <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were surprisingly proactive.</sentence><sentence id="408">And based on what this fellow, recently has told me, it's still true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: In general, the Nazis were much more popular and stronger in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Oh is that so, I see, I didn't realize that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: The smaller the more likely...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="421">Q: Big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> tended to be Red.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="423">A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore thumb I suppose.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: Even though there weren't very many Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course... An interesting incident that this guy told me.</sentence><sentence id="428">There's a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, today, and would you believe that every Friday they bake and sell challah?</sentence><sentence id="429">And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian population loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right.</sentence><sentence id="430">And today, they have forgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the way it is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: And when.</sentence><sentence id="436">And when.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="440">This generation at least, has forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="441">It is amazing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: And yet they do it on Friday.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words.</sentence><sentence id="454">That's amazing I thought...here is archeology in action while I'm still alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Do any other incidents leap to your mind?</sentence></p></dialogue>
