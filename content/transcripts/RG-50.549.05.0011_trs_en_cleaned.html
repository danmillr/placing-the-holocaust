<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="280">It was a time I thought maybe one has to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> those times.</sentence><sentence id="281">I will not deny there was not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="282">But you know anti-Semitism until today has many faces.</sentence><sentence id="283">There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a political anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="284">And for me and my observance, my conviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it was more economic anti- Semitism, with some reasons, objective reasons.</sentence><sentence id="285">They were nobody's fault, but the situation became so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn't be, maybe it is nobody's fault, but it was.</sentence><sentence id="286">I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="287">Well, there is in every <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>, there are some extreme people, which they can get... and they are more doing it for personal reasons and for gaining something of it.</sentence><sentence id="288">And this is also the political anti- Semitism, which is to gain something to rule over people.</sentence><sentence id="289">You know?</sentence><sentence id="290">And Jews were more educated, absolutely more educated than the common people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">Because as I told you before, I started to study when I was three.</sentence><sentence id="292">You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it gives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of eight or nine or ten even.</sentence><sentence id="293">Some of them didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the Polish people didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ever.</sentence><sentence id="294">There was illiteracy, too.</sentence><sentence id="295">So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="296">And the masses didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="297">Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don't know when they are going to vote, what they need and what they want.</sentence><sentence id="298">It is until today everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="299">But especially in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which was, which wasn't so educated.</sentence><sentence id="300">There was a lot of people who didn't have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from promises and so forth, you know.</sentence><sentence id="301">And then <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I would need to go into the situation of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, how <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became free after being occupied by three <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Well let's not get into overall historical...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: Yeah, I understand.</sentence><sentence id="328">I understand, but the Jews even, in each occupied party, had different opportunities.</sentence><sentence id="329">In the <span class="REGION">Russian occupied part</span> they couldn't progress like this we could make in the Austro-Hungarian or in the <span class="REGION">German occupied territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">So here comes the difference.</sentence><sentence id="331">Education, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point.</sentence><sentence id="332">And this gave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is.</sentence><sentence id="333">He is anti-Semite, why and what, we didn't analyze and that wasn't important.</sentence><sentence id="334">We had to feel it and that what it is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: When you were in the Army then, in 1935 and "36, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish Poles?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Ten percent was Jews.</sentence><sentence id="350">It was the same, approximately the same relative like it was, the population was about ten percent and there was about ten percent was in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="353"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0011 7</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: It's difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you the time.</sentence><sentence id="362">You have so many things to do that you don't have the time to play these games.</sentence><sentence id="363">But, but, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="364">What kind?</sentence><sentence id="365">They were so educated, they were so prepared.</sentence><sentence id="366">That was the elite.</sentence><sentence id="367">That they, but of course, they didn't, they didn't want to show up as anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="368">But you could feel it, you could feel it.</sentence><sentence id="369">Not everybody felt it.</sentence><sentence id="370">And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve.</sentence><sentence id="371">The rich Jews who didn't want to go to the Army, there was always finding a way of bribery.</sentence><sentence id="372">To whom?</sentence><sentence id="373">To the Polish officers, to the Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and they are sick and they cannot serve.</sentence><sentence id="374">And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="375">There were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="376">And then there was another thing.</sentence><sentence id="377">After matriculation you are going to the <span class="BUILDING">officer's school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">And in the <span class="BUILDING">officer's school</span>, they didn't want the Jews to become officers.</sentence><sentence id="379">They were there because they were, after matriculation that was the law.</sentence><sentence id="380">So usually they find always a way to send them back to the normal Army, not to live in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to become an officer.</sentence><sentence id="381">There were officers, Jewish officers, but very few, very few.</sentence><sentence id="382">It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a high officer in the Polish Army.</sentence><sentence id="383">There were higher officers only medical officers, because they needed them.</sentence><sentence id="384">They have to take them and that's what it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: So, by the time you were in the Service, you were a dentist, were you a dentist already?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the service and then get out.</sentence><sentence id="414">Is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="418">When the time came to go out, I got a phone from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> that one doctor who was by himself a Colonel in the Polish Army, doctor, dentist.</sentence><sentence id="419">He had <span class="BUILDING">private office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="420">He was ready to retire and he had a <span class="BUILDING">private office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="421">But he got a heart attack and they took him to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="422">And they phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out that position.</sentence><sentence id="423">So the last day in the Polish Army... and even the greatest anti-Semite in my unit, came to me, they make me a party, my departure, that was ad hoc make a party for me.</sentence><sentence id="424">He came to me, he said, "You know I am twenty years in the Polish Army.</sentence><sentence id="425">I am professional officer, high officer.</sentence><sentence id="426">I'm a major there."</sentence><sentence id="427">He said, "You are the first Jew I know had such a good time in the Army like you have.</sentence><sentence id="428">Like you had."</sentence><sentence id="429">And I said to them good bye, and I left.</sentence><sentence id="430">And immediately the next day I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and I start to work because I had to fulfill this, this... later on he was released from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">He survived and he came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, but I still was working with him.</sentence><sentence id="432">He couldn't work anymore.</sentence><sentence id="433">So I was working with him about a year and a half, something like this.</sentence><sentence id="434">And then I opened my own <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

with?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2072">A: Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which we had.</sentence><sentence id="2073">We were, as I told you, living as Christians.</sentence><sentence id="2074">And the liberation came.</sentence><sentence id="2075">We couldn't enjoy our liberation or <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2076">It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="2077">That was the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="2078">And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences between people who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very different.</sentence><sentence id="2079">We have two things to overcome.</sentence><sentence id="2080">The first is, which we had all the time, that was the fight for existence and how to survive, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And the next, when the liberation came was the shock to find the reality.</sentence><sentence id="2082">You don't have where to go.</sentence><sentence id="2083">You couldn't find nobody you know, or anybody of your people.</sentence><sentence id="2084">You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2086">We were ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2087">And if I... realize it was a <span

felt that I am back a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2090">But I couldn't officially declare it.</sentence><sentence id="2091">I had to stay on my Aryan papers.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And how to go and where to go?</sentence><sentence id="2093">Because to go to my other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born there, I wasn't sure that I will be accepted.</sentence><sentence id="2094">And I wasn't sure to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, for example, because I didn't have where to go.</sentence><sentence id="2095">Even not where to sleep at night.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And you don't have money.</sentence><sentence id="2097">And you don't have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out whatever you had.</sentence><sentence id="2098">So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so- called liberation was the terrible hit of the reality.</sentence><sentence id="2099">You were hit with the reality.</sentence><sentence id="2100">Not where to go and not what to do and how to start.</sentence><sentence id="2101">Will you be accepted as a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="2102">You cannot go on and to say you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I used to live.</sentence><sentence id="2103">And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were before, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer.</sentence><sentence id="2104">To watch the horse and the cows.</sentence><sentence id="2105">In reality I was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="2106">I want to go back.</sentence><sentence id="2107">I didn't have nothing with me, but I have to go to start to look for our existence.</sentence><sentence id="2108">And as I said before already that part, I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was born, and then later when they went with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, all this trouble I have with Fryda and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2109">But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very simple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together.</sentence><sentence id="2110">But when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, when I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, start to organize my life.</sentence><sentence id="2111">And with the help of the uncle which came, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> as I said.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we became refugees.</sentence><sentence id="2113">We became as one of the United Nations refugees.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2328">A: First of all, they didn't realize who is a Jew or no, except that they really recognize by physiognomy, they saw it is a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2329">And then in reality they were not more, well they didn't have in their program to kill Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2330">That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don't know, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or Lithuanians or Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="2331">There were all kinds of soldiers there.</sentence><sentence id="2332">So that was more individual and then it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2333">The Russians didn't hesitate to kill a Jew, too.</sentence><sentence id="2334">However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army.</sentence><sentence id="2335">In this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> there were many Jews, I mean for us, many... five was many.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Because we used already without Jews here in this side, the <span class="REGION">German side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2337">But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didn't hear, you could hear...

from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3107">And in reality, the most educated people which we met in <span

id="3108">From <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3109">Because the aliyah which came to <span

the problem of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is not solved and will never be solved in my opinion.</sentence><sentence id="3133">That's war... my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3202">Q: When your son was growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> did he ask you about your past and about the Holocaust years?</sentence><sentence id="3203">Or did you tell him about what had happened there?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3241">Q: So it wasn't so much a part of cultural life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> then to even talk about it, even though it's a society mostly composed of Jews?</sentence><sentence id="3242">People weren't, the children weren't being taught necessarily about what had happened in Europe with the Nazis" extermination of Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3245">A: Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for.</sentence><sentence id="3246">My culture life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was very, very developed.</sentence><sentence id="3247">First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I studied a lot.</sentence><sentence id="3248">And except of which I went to <span class="BUILDING">concert</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, all <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theater</span>, I mean <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3249">I understood and I could take it.</sentence><sentence id="3250">And then I had a very rich <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in Hebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my first, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish language which you have your basic education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3257">Q: My question was more about whether your son, your son was... or even in this, I would maybe have guessed that in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> he would have been taught about the Holocaust because he's living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3258">But from what you're saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3261">A: You are right.</sentence><sentence id="3262">In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="3263">Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3264">And the Jews from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, tourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding.</sentence><sentence id="3265">And there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was always the comer, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3266">Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> and to <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and wherever you want, you have everywhere people in the world.</sentence><sentence id="3267">So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of course, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> to more knowledge about the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3844">A: Well, I feel it, I feel it maybe personally, but I don't blame them.</sentence><sentence id="3845">Maybe they were expecting more involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn't do, first of my age, secondly my language is not good enough to expose my... it is maybe improved already, but in the beginning my English was good to read, to understand.</sentence><sentence id="3846">But to speak with my accent, to talk about my experience and to be active in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, it wasn't easy.</sentence><sentence id="3847">It was maybe difficult.</sentence><sentence id="3848">I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> maybe.</sentence><sentence id="3849">But he never asked me.</sentence><sentence id="3850">And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like that.</sentence><sentence id="3851">Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that's not my specialty.</sentence><sentence id="3852">I will not do it.</sentence><sentence id="3853">And that's one thing.</sentence><sentence id="3854">The other thing is, which one influential person told me, that they feel humiliated in my company.</sentence><sentence id="3855">That I am too special for them, so therefore they are hesitating approach me.</sentence><sentence id="3856">Well, I don't know what is true, what the reason is, but this is the reality what I told you.</sentence><sentence id="3857">Iam a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="3858">However they are friendly.</sentence><sentence id="3859">If I approach them they answer my questions, but that's all, that's all.</sentence><sentence id="3860">What can you do?</sentence><sentence id="3861">That's the reality.</sentence><sentence id="3862">And you have to live with it and we take it.</sentence><sentence id="3863">And we learn after so many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each reality.</sentence><sentence id="3864">This is the main source of our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life.</sentence><sentence id="3865">And that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3888">Q: Last time after we finished our interview you mentioned off tape, something about the "business" of the Holocaust or the business that the Holocaust has become and I wonder if you would say something about that.</sentence><sentence id="3889">Does it bother you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been overly commercialized?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3892">47</sentence><sentence id="3894">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0011 48</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3895">A: Again, I don't know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3896">You know, each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> tries to make a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span>, which in itself is maybe a nice deed.</sentence><sentence id="3897">But who will come to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3898">I think the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> is the one which was a necessity, very important.</sentence><sentence id="3899">And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3900">Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value.</sentence><sentence id="3901">But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> where they have everything.</sentence><sentence id="3902">And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3903">It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3904">Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="3905">But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help.</sentence><sentence id="3906">That is what I think.</sentence><sentence id="3907">And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything.</sentence><sentence id="3908">So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don't know, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3909">Of course, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very famous.</sentence><sentence id="3910">But I don't want to criticize them.</sentence><sentence id="3911">I don't want to criticize nobody.</sentence><sentence id="3912">But I think it is a crime if somebody makes it only for the business.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3931">Q: I'm coming to the end of my questions.</sentence><sentence id="3932">Is there something that we haven't talked about that you'd like to talk about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3935">A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it.</sentence><sentence id="3936">It doesn't mean that I don't have, in general, what to say about.</sentence><sentence id="3937">And especially to the future generations of Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="3938">Maybe somebody will listen to it.</sentence><sentence id="3939">Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of view.</sentence><sentence id="3940">But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering.</sentence><sentence id="3941">It is like one Jewish sage said: "It is good to be born a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3942">It's good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem."</sentence><sentence id="3943">From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don't have.</sentence><sentence id="3944">Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life.</sentence><sentence id="3945">Even in the world.</sentence><sentence id="3946">Not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3947">Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> or singles.</sentence><sentence id="3948">Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="REGION">medical field</span>, in general science are not compatible to no one other people.</sentence><sentence id="3949">Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred.</sentence><sentence id="3950">I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn't concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization.</sentence><sentence id="3951">A <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world.</sentence><sentence id="3952">But I am turning to the other <span class="NPIP">point</span> not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use.</sentence><sentence id="3953">To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways.</sentence><sentence id="3954">This is my advice and this is my way of thinking.</sentence><sentence id="3955">And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> in civilized world.</sentence><sentence id="3956">That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today.</sentence><sentence id="3957">To avoid it, listen what I said.</sentence><sentence id="3958">Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
