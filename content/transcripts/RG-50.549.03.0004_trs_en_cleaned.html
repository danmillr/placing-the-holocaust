<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="52">5 in the army.</sentence><sentence id="53">It was -- so a -- when then -- the 12" of January, 1945, was the left -- the less [indecipherable] towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, towards the -- take over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeszow</span>, when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August.</sentence><sentence id="54">And for six months nothing happened, they stayed in one <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and they made all the preparations for the final push.</sentence><sentence id="55">The January the 12" the war started -- I mean, the [indecipherable] started towards the west, and this was actually the last [indecipherable] til the war was ended.</sentence><sentence id="56">Now I was picked out -- in this time they picked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young, mostly officers, and we were assigned to go with the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">As the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> went, we went right with them, and from the hundred, soon as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was liberated, some of us remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to establish a Polish presence, and to start to organize -- organize security, and -- and <span class="BUILDING">civil offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">So each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had some people left, two or three.</sentence><sentence id="59">I was assigned to do the same thing, but til we will re -- reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">When we reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> -- so from the hundred remained maybe 50 or 60, and we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6w</span>, and I was assigned to the same units, which was the military -- the military intelligence, but my si -- my par - - there were a lot of sections.</sentence><sentence id="61">People had the section with the clergy, people had the section with the civil organization.</sentence><sentence id="62">I -- my section was that I had to do with Germans who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, or who remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, or Polish people who collaborated with the Germans -- and they changed during the occupation, they made out papers</sentence><sentence id="64">6 that they are ethnic Germans.</sentence><sentence id="65">And because I spoke German, so I was attached to this unit, and also we had a lot of German prisoners of war, so I interrogated them, and this is how I became the head of the county f -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6ew</span> for this reason, for this purposes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: I will summarize the story of how you met your wife, because it is a long one --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: -- and we have only 15 minutes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: But I would like to talk about afterwards, so what -- so when -- once you had taken care of the columns, that was disconnected, the -- Krakew was saved, what were the other jobs?</sentence><sentence id="91">You had a lot of work to do.</sentence><sentence id="92">What was basically ho -- what did you work, and -- and what was the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was -- luckily <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> was not touched.</sentence><sentence id="97">It was not destroyed y -- like other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> for instance, was 90 percent destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="99"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> was not destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the Germans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where -- were mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th -- main thing to eliminate those things.</sentence><sentence id="100">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> wasn't destroyed, but our -- our da -- duty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who</sentence><sentence id="102">7 collaborated with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="103">Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were some who remained.</sentence><sentence id="104">But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people, but during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their grandfather was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or great grandfather was a colonist.</sentence><sentence id="105">And e -- sometimes even if it was not true.</sentence><sentence id="106">They wanted to do it, why?</sentence><sentence id="107">Because doing this they became ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get a nicer <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they could get a good job.</sentence><sentence id="108">Even the Polish people who were sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and they were -- didn't have the rice, they had more rice, and they were the elite during the German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="109">Now, as the Germans left, those people tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors.</sentence><sentence id="110">So naturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them.</sentence><sentence id="111">If they came from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, if they started having new papers.</sentence><sentence id="112">So mostly this was our aim, and this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">So this was the main things that we had to have.</sentence><sentence id="114">Then I got an -- a special job.</sentence><sentence id="115">This was -- now we occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, officially occupation was the 19" of January, 1945.This was official date.</sentence><sentence id="116">I was two days before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, but this was the official date when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> was occupied do -- by the Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="117">And -- and the only Polish unit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators.</sentence><sentence id="118">In beginning, or i-i-</sentence><sentence id="120">8 in th -- in beginning of February, a group came from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and this was the -- organization to study the crimes of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="121">And the head of this group was Hewlett Johns -- Johnson.</sentence><sentence id="122">He was the Dean of Canterbury from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">He was a archbishop and he was the head.</sentence><sentence id="124">And he had in his group mostly professors from different <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who were not a g -- who -- who didn't work with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="125">Like in Europe a lot of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> collaborated, and they had armies like <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">Those were professors from <span class="NPIP">places</span> that they were always against the Germans, or the Germans were occupying their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">We had professors from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, from all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="128">And I was assigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day's activity for this group where to go.</sentence><sentence id="129">We went to all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, to -- like for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> maybe two weeks after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="130">Everything was fresh.</sentence><sentence id="131">The de -- the destruction of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>, they we -- still were hot from -- from -- from fire.</sentence><sentence id="132">The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they were still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn't dry up.</sentence><sentence id="133">And then th-the -- the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> from children's shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those thing.</sentence><sentence id="134">This was just in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="135">And we found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> also, about 20 to thir -- 25,000 people who couldn't be sent out with the death marches like they did before the Russians occupied.</sentence><sentence id="136">So I went with this group for about four, five weeks.</sentence><sentence id="139">9 Every day we -- the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and my job was to prepare the itinerary for the next day.</sentence><sentence id="140">Where to go, how to go, to have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and the transportation for the group.</sentence><sentence id="141">And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me out and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation from the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">During the times that we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, there was a other aim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very happy with the communists who came in.</sentence><sentence id="143">Now this, everything was staged, nothing was the truth.</sentence><sentence id="144">Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname, the Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-<span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">When he went, for instance to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was pro-<span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group of Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which i -- this was all staged.</sentence><sentence id="148">So I said to him, "Well, let's find out, let's stop and find out from the people what they think about the new regime."</sentence><sentence id="149">Because they started to take away <span class="REGION">land</span> from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants.</sentence><sentence id="150">So we stopped, and I asked them in Polish, and it was translated.</sentence><sentence id="151">Now those were not peasants that we met occa -- special we met.</sentence><sentence id="152">Those were people who were told to be on this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, dressed</sentence><sentence id="154">10 like peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants use.</sentence><sentence id="155">And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it's good to find out.</sentence><sentence id="156">Now, they were prepared, those were people who were from the government.</sentence><sentence id="157">Tho -- there were -- who belonged to the communist eg -- organizations.</sentence><sentence id="158">And they were prepared what they will be asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer.</sentence><sentence id="159">And naturally all of them said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the peasants.</sentence><sentence id="160">And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants.</sentence><sentence id="161">And they took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their <span class="DLF">fields</span>, and they divided, they gave.</sentence><sentence id="162">And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable].And this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and this was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are very, very happy with it.</sentence><sentence id="163">But this -- everything was staged.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: I want to ask you just one more question about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">You also were involved to some degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because [indecipherable] people were coming back</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Yeah, I was -- not officially.</sentence><sentence id="244">Officially I couldn't be ra -- i-involved because the first thing, I was not a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="245">I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="246">And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help people.</sentence><sentence id="247">Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="255">11 wife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because there -- there was no -- you couldn't buy food, and people didn't have food.</sentence><sentence id="256">So I use -- and we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my adjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and other things.</sentence><sentence id="257">Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn't have yet people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, because it took a few weeks til they started to come in.</sentence><sentence id="258">But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in hiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half.</sentence><sentence id="259">They find out that there is a -- somebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food.</sentence><sentence id="260">So they started to come to her and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="261">Now, as she gave them the food, naturally, she notified me.</sentence><sentence id="262">I didn't see her so often in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="263">She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially, sent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away.</sentence><sentence id="264">Also, I gave her a lot of clothing.</sentence><sentence id="265">As we took over a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, where Germans left, or people who were collaborators were arrested, we confiscated their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, and we had all the things from their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people who came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn't -- it was winter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="266">So I gave it to her and I was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there</sentence><sentence id="268">12 were more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it -- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially.</sentence><sentence id="269">Then later I also find out that there was a woman, and there is a film made about it.</sentence><sentence id="270">They called it, "My Hundred Children."</sentence><sentence id="271">And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo -- after fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to hide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the parents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children.</sentence><sentence id="272">And the children didn't have where to go.</sentence><sentence id="273">So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those children, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they wrote, "My Hundred Children."</sentence><sentence id="274">She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she collected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on -- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn't had wa -- what -- how to feed them.</sentence><sentence id="275">So she find out about me, because when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and I went right away to two leaders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish committee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt.</sentence><sentence id="276">And then it was a rabbi who survived the war, not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak6w</span>, but he kra -- remained, and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and he was like the official rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="277">His name was Steinberg.</sentence><sentence id="278">So I came to them and I told them, "Listen, I am a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="279">Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want you should know.</sentence><sentence id="280">Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I</sentence><sentence id="282">13 have a big <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do what I can do."</sentence><sentence id="284">In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems, and -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, "Treasure of Jewish Memories," I'm describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for -- from this time.</sentence><sentence id="285">So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn't have what to wear, they didn't have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn't give them money, and I -- so we had a lot of sugar.</sentence><sentence id="286">And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and we took it over.</sentence><sentence id="287">So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if you have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you as much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar.</sentence><sentence id="288">So this way they could support themselves.</sentence><sentence id="289">Then later they needed some clothing.</sentence><sentence id="290">And we took away from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> two large <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span>, because the Germans had <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> for underwear, shirts and other things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards.</sentence><sentence id="291">Now the Poles didn't get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this material in two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">They were big <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> because this was a whole [indecipherable] and I find out about it.</sentence><sentence id="293">So we went and we confiscated everything.</sentence><sentence id="294">So I had a lot of this material.</sentence><sentence id="295">I remember there were children's socks, and children's underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came</sentence><sentence id="297">14 over to them, so I brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> full of those things and I gave it to them.</sentence><sentence id="298">Now, they knew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="299">And when I took it out from the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span>, the people who work with me, they didn't know why I take it away.</sentence><sentence id="300">Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="301">But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: When you think about the time today, you were very busy -- about that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> -- you were very busy, you had a lot of work.</sentence><sentence id="359">Was that special for you, that time of fo -- and if so, for what reason?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best times of my life.</sentence><sentence id="363">And I think this was the best time.</sentence><sentence id="364">One time was the best time when I -- like for instance, when I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, naturally we starved, it was cold, and it was terrible fear.</sentence><sentence id="365">But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a raid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puskov</span>, from the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was the happiest day in my life.</sentence><sentence id="366">As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and in th -- in -- and what I explained to him it is -- it was like when I had the machine gun in my hand, it's like a lame who couldn't walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to walk.</sentence><sentence id="367">To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn't any more the pe -- the person who was killed, that I could pay back.</sentence><sentence id="368">And this was my life why I wanted to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="371">15</sentence></p><p><sentence id="372">live.</sentence><sentence id="373">To take revenge, which I did as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="374">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span>, it was a other, naturally we couldn't go out, we couldn't kill people any more, it was after the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="375">But for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had nothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with them, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic, because in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman, each individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing, they didn't change.</sentence><sentence id="376">Now, if I could do something, I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="377">People that I didn't know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they went to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="378">And also, also, if they needed <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, and there was every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, usually there was a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> where they gave out the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">Now, if a Jew came for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and even he lived before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, they wouldn't give it to him because the people were very, very against Jews.</sentence><sentence id="380">And they said, "Well, why did you come back?"</sentence><sentence id="381">And they looked at that Jew -- and now I'm writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title of the book is what they used to say in the title is, you are still alive?</sentence><sentence id="382">I -- and the subtitle is, I thought they killed all of you.</sentence><sentence id="383">This was the first question -- the first that a Pole ask a Jew when he survived.</sentence><sentence id="384">But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi and the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it.</sentence><sentence id="385">Now this was a very,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="388">16 very rewarding thing for me.</sentence><sentence id="389">Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody did anything.</sentence><sentence id="390">And this time we were undress -- I'm not talking I personally, but the Jews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a <span class="DLF">ditch</span>, and we were killed.</sentence><sentence id="391">Now if e- each one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody will do it.</sentence><sentence id="392">Now, after the war, people didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="393">The war is ended, and everybody was interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a family.</sentence><sentence id="394">But for me, I survived for two reasons --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: -- for me, I survived for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="396">And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a legacy, you had to have a reason.</sentence><sentence id="397">Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="398">And I had two.</sentence><sentence id="399">One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge, and I -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams.</sentence><sentence id="400">This was one that gave me strength.</sentence><sentence id="401">I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to pay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister's husbands, pay back for my nieces and nephews.</sentence><sentence id="402">Who would pay back?</sentence><sentence id="403">So this mean that they were killed, and nothing will happen to the people who did it.</sentence><sentence id="404">So this was one legacy that it gave me strength.</sentence><sentence id="405">To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> with my five sisters to be killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span>, she somehow gave to somebry --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="408">17</sentence></p><p><sentence id="409">body a letter, and I got the letter from this person.</sentence><sentence id="410">I was in [indecipherable] and she wrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="411">You are young, you are strong, you are smart.</sentence><sentence id="412">If somebody will survive, you will survive.</sentence><sentence id="413">Because she believes that somebody will survive.</sentence><sentence id="414">She said, "After the war, go to your brother," because I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, "go to y -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, go to your brother," I had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, "and tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us."</sentence><sentence id="415">So this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people didn't want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="416">But I spoke, and they thought I have an obsession, some people didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="417">Later, 20 years later, st -- people started to realize, and they listened.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="418">Books came out, movies came out.</sentence><sentence id="419">But I started to speak the first minute I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and I told the stories.</sentence><sentence id="420">And people thought that it is something wrong with me.</sentence><sentence id="421">And this gave me strength to survive.</sentence><sentence id="422">That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know what a cruel thing happened in this time.</sentence><sentence id="423">And for this reason not only J, all survivors, their duty is to write down, and to write and tell the stories.</sentence><sentence id="424">Because everyone survived a different way.</sentence><sentence id="425">Everyone had different problems and cruelties.</sentence><sentence id="426">So for this I am telling, and I am going out, if somebody asked me to go and speak, I don't care where and how and when, I never took money f-for it, and I am doing it because I think this is my duty, that the people should know what happened.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="429">18</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence

long="16.85199">Breslau</span> | had a lot of work, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>, first thing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> was 90 percent or 85 percent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people should come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span>, and a -- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="438">Now they left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very important, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="439">Naturally they -- when they were sent out,

because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to the -- her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislav</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislavov</span> in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under co-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class [indecipherable] middle class they were --

left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="487">Q: I want to ask you a follow up question though.</sentence><sentence id="488">Were there other thoughts of why you wanted to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: Yo -- well, my th -- my thought -- well, see, the first thing my wife wanted to leave, of course, she had family in pales -- in is -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at this time.</sentence><sentence id="492">She had a grandmother, she had a sister, she has three uncles with her family.</sentence><sentence id="493">So she said, well she had somebody.</sentence><sentence id="494">And I wanted to leave because I saw, even now -- I have a good <span class="NPIP">position</span> and everything, but I had to masquerade.</sentence><sentence id="495">I wanted to be myself.</sentence><sentence id="496">I -- why should I -- if we have a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and if we -- the communist

myself?</sentence><sentence id="499">And also, being a non-Jew, the people who work with me, the people who were in the government didn't have no secrets because I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="500">So then I could see that deep in -- imbedded anti-Semitism towards Jews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="503">21</sentence></p><p><sentence id="504">And nobody was a friend sp -- in those -- in this time.</sentence><sentence id="505">Even officially they couldn't go out and say, well I hate Jews, and this and that, but inside everybody was anti-Semite.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="506">Now, in the -- there were no secrets from me, so I saw that this will not be a life for me, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, in the Russian system there were three kinds of people.</sentence><sentence id="507">People who were in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, people -- pe -- he -- people who were in <span

[indecipherable], so then I would say, well this is my life, and I love it.</sentence><sentence id="509">I wasn't -- I come from a very Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox home.</sentence><sentence id="510">Reet

was very smart, she said, longer we will wait, worse it be to come out.</sentence><sentence id="517">And naturally I went out first, and she remained and she was arrested because they thought through her they will get me.</sentence><sentence id="518">So -- but I never,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="521">22</sentence></p><p><sentence id="522">never had my mind, because this was not a regime for me.</sentence><sentence id="523">Now, we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">I was registered, and I worked with that group called

class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there was other -- other problem to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because you couldn't go officially, you had to go illegally, and you wind out in <span

application."</sentence><sentence id="647">So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed two witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="648">And when the two witnesses gave a statement that they know you, you come from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and everything, the two witness was -- so everybody got two witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="649">One was a witness for him, then later he was a witness for them.</sentence><sentence id="650">And then the people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day.</sentence><sentence id="651">Then later the people knew that we made this change, and they were very happy.</sentence><sentence id="652">Even til today some people who</sentence><sentence id="654">27 are here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up.</sentence><sentence id="655">And this way, we -- this woman was fired.</sentence><sentence id="656">They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was still there.</sentence><sentence id="657">It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was a -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn't take care on all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him.</sentence><sentence id="658">When we were assigned to him, and -- and he didn't ask us too many question because we had the two affidavits.</sentence><sentence id="659">Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in.</sentence><sentence id="660">So I was afraid because I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with this woman, and now he is giving me this thing.</sentence><sentence id="661">Well, we got the visa and we had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> we got stuck for six months.</sentence><sentence id="662">And then later we went on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="663">Those were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, th-the name was Ernie Pyle.</sentence><sentence id="664">This was the last time that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty ship</span>, and unlucky we were cause it was in the winter, it was in January, and -- and underw -- underway it was a terrible storm, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, the boiler, everything broke and we almost drowned.</sentence><sentence id="665">And everybody was so sick, that I was laying on the -- on -- on the [indecipherable] the -- the people, the men were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, what maybe 201 in -- in -- in this <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="666">Now the women were 20 - 25 in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span>, when -- and I was so sick I was laying out -- outside on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="667">And I pray to God it's -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> should sink.</sentence><sentence id="668">I couldn't take it, I didn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="669">So my wife, in this time she put on a woman's housecoat with the woman's pajama and the kerchief</sentence><sentence id="671">28 on my head, and she took me in in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="672">And the people in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> knew and -- that I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better.</sentence><sentence id="673">But what -- we were very, very angry that the German people who went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in this time, cause a lot of German went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, they had family here, they had the big, best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span>, because they had money to pay.</sentence><sentence id="674">And they -- the people from the company were German, so they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing.</sentence><sentence id="675">And we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair.</sentence><sentence id="676">But this how they came.</sentence><sentence id="677">So mo -- not only on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">So the German people had all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave them those <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and they could pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="679">So then we came to -- we came to [indecipherable] we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> January the 17", and -- and -- and we were so sick.</sentence><sentence id="680">So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="681">So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the - - the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited half a night, we were just staying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> waiting for the Statue of Liberty.</sentence><sentence id="682">And when the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of Liberty, everybody from us started to cry.</sentence><sentence id="683">Even today [indecipherable] we saw already the <span class="BUILDING">Statue of Liberty</span>, and this we -- we are in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end.</sentence><sentence id="685">Then later when we -- we went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the</sentence><sentence id="687">29 <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="688">Everyone to his initial, N to N, S to S and so on, and then later they came to check.</sentence><sentence id="689">So the American customs, they opened the valises, they [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="690">And we were staying there in -- where -- where the [indecipherable] then a [indecipherable] a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- in the lumber jacket comes in and he goes around and he ask where is it, where are the Saleschutz's?</sentence><sentence id="691">Sa -- so we were very much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong, and they would ship us back or something.</sentence><sentence id="692">We didn't say anything in the beginning and later he said, "Well, their should -- was supposed to be two people with the name Saleschutz," yeah.</sentence><sentence id="693">So my wife was standing there, and she said, "Yes, we are Saleschutz."</sentence><sentence id="694">And "What's wrong, what's wrong?"</sentence><sentence id="695">We were so afraid.</sentence><sentence id="696">So he said, "Nothing is wrong."</sentence><sentence id="697">And he got up to my wife and he kissed her, he got up to me, he said, "You know, I am," -- and we thought this is some official, he said, "I am Yagi, Reisel's son."</sentence><sentence id="698">Later he became Jake.</sentence><sentence id="699">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> [indecipherable], "I am Yagi and I find out that you are coming, so I came in here."</sentence><sentence id="700">Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right away, when we were standing, and all the people didn't know what -- what to think.</sentence><sentence id="701">And he right away called the custom man and the custom came and he didn't open anything, he just put in a piece of paper on this and he called a longshoreman, and he took the two suitcase we have and put them in.</sentence><sentence id="702">And he -- all the people are waiting, they're waiting, and we were taken out, and they -- they thought, who knows, that probably we are the</sentence><sentence id="704">30 president of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="705">And we ta -- he took us out in the -- right on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> when we took us out, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was waiting and we went in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and this was -- my brother was waiting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, they couldn't park there, but through him they parked.</sentence><sentence id="706">So we find out later, and w-we said, this Jack he had -- he became Jack, he had a luncheonette on the -- on -- by the <span

out.</sentence><sentence id="709">Naturally this was a very surprise -- and a pleasant surprise in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">And later we find out he was a very nice fellow.</sentence><sentence id="711">And this is how we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="712">We arrived -- this is the 17" of January in 1947.</sentence></p></dialogue>

said.</sentence><sentence id="2249">When I ask you about the achievements -- I mean, you have had a long work life here, and you have built things.</sentence><sentence id="2250">You have a family now, you have built things.</sentence><sentence id="2251">When I ask you what -- what do you consider the -- the achievements here, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, for you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2252">A: Well, the achievements in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the first thing is that I had a daughter.</sentence><sentence id="2253">This is the main -- th-this is the highlife -- the highlight, because wouldn't I have a daughter, my life wouldn't be worth anything, because why did I survive?</sentence><sentence id="2254">To have a continuation.</sentence><sentence id="2255">The Jews lived for so many years, and I had to have a continuation.</sentence><sentence id="2256">Now</sentence><sentence id="2258">78 she -- I have a daughter, she has three grandsons.</sentence><sentence id="2259">So it means that Hitler didn't win the war.</sentence><sentence id="2260">With me he didn't win the war, because his -- to win the war, it means to an -- an -- to destroy every single Jew, and with me he couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="2261">Now, we had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> very few -- only -- only four people survived ous -- from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2262">Now all the people when I look back -- when I look back and I -- there were families, the families stretched 300 years, nobody survived.</sentence><sentence id="2263">And then when they killed the last one -- so it means they just destroyed everything.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And with me, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2265">My father had me, and I have Esther, Esther has the children, and the generation goes on.</sentence><sentence id="2266">I -- I'm very -- a little disappointed in -- not disappointed, I feel bad that I don't have a son, and the reason why, because by Jews, there is a sect, and we call it kohanim.</sentence><sentence id="2267">The kohanim descend from the priestly family.</sentence><sentence id="2268">Now this started, the first Cohen was Aaron -- a Cohen, Moses" brother.</sentence><sentence id="2269">This is a -- 4,000 years.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And a son came after the father, after the father, and it was never change, because the Jews how -- not religious -- I mean, they were not religious, but this they obeyed, that a son should be a Cohen after a father.</sentence><sentence id="2271">Now this went on for 4,000 years til it came to me.</sentence><sentence id="2272">Now, I don't know how many forefathers were killed because they were Jews, probably a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2273">My father was killed because I -- because he was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2274">But I remained, and I took his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2275">Who knows, maybe his forefathers were killed by the Crusaders in the [indecipherable].We don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2276">So because it lasted for so -- for 4,000 years, and it never -- the string,</sentence><sentence id="2278">79 the lineage was never cut off.</sentence><sentence id="2279">And so not being a Cohen is cut off by me, because a daughter is not -- she herself is a Cohen, a daughter of a Cohen, but her children are not any more.</sentence><sentence id="2280">So this I am a little disappointed, because I would like this lineage should be long, and it should be til the end of time.</sentence><sentence id="2281">But it isn't, but Iam happy.</sentence><sentence id="2282">And they are -- they are the three boys, and -- and they should know that they are very proud to be Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2283">And if -- if -- if one of them would marry out of religion, this will be the worst thing for me, I don't know if I could survive it.</sentence><sentence id="2284">Not because era -- oh -- I bel -- I told you this before, not because about not being religious, but not being a Jew, because there was a man, there was a nation, they want a -- nea -- hel -- a -- destroy all the Jews, and I said no, I want to be alive.</sentence><sentence id="2285">And through me -- not only me, and others, said we are going around, we going a -- we are here, we establish a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, we in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2286">We are Jews, and we did so much for -- for the world, that I want the continuation should be.</sentence></p></dialogue>

started to yell, again I talk a lot, so I started yell don't buy here shoes, I wouldn't let you buy shoes.</sentence><sentence id="2538">And she asked me why.</sentence><sentence id="2539">I said go

blacks?</sentence><sentence id="2541">You cannot -- you cannot buy here.</sentence><sentence id="2542">And I pulled her out and she didn't buy the shoes, because for me it was something new.</sentence><sentence id="2543">On the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we stopped, I th-think, in <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span>, something like that, and we went in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and with us was there a girl, she was from -- a Jewish girl from <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span>, she was dark.</sentence><sentence id="2544">We were sitting by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we -- we ordered some food.</sentence><sentence id="2545">So I made a joke, I made a joke and I said I hope they will not see -- recognize you who you are, because -- made believe that she is black, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2546">And the waitress heard it and two minutes later, the -- a manager came and th-th-th -- he said you wa -- and they were -- they threw us out from the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> because we were with this girl.</sentence><sentence id="2547">And she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2548">So when they threw us out, I didn't want to go, then they called the police and we went out, and there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police motorcycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2549">And they ask where is your - - where is your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, I told them.</sentence><sentence id="2550">They said, you leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we will escort

that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2556">A: This was in 19 -- in 1949.</sentence><sentence id="2557">19 four -- deg49 or 50, yeah, "49.</sentence><sentence id="2558">So they went behind us, we were out -- ou-out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so they turned back.</sentence><sentence id="2559">And I described this in one of the vignettes.</sentence><sentence id="2560">And this was a terrible thing for me.</sentence><sentence id="2561">I couldn't understand how come that -- that -- that here in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that I admire so much, and -- and there are people -- see, in this time, for me, the-the-the-the -- when they -- we called them Negroes in this time, that they suffered and I could see them as I was a second class citizen in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="2562">So this was very, very, very -- it -- it was terrible for me.</sentence><sentence id="2563">I -- I -- I remember I had later, and thi -- I had later in -- in <span class="BUILDING">Hoboken houses</span>, so I had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and there one -- one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- you see, all those stories I have written down that will be in my -- in the book.</sentence><sentence id="2564">Yeah, so there was one man, he was the president from the NAACP in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span>, he didn't pay me rent, I went for the rent, we had an argument, he beat me up.</sentence><sentence id="2565">And -- and -- and I went -- I want to go to police.</sentence><sentence id="2566">So then I was in this time chairman from the ADL, from, you know, Anti-Defamation League from B'nai Brith.</sentence><sentence id="2567">So I told the stories, I said I want to make a case out of it because the ADL and the Jews they emancipated, in this time the blacks, they gave them lawyers to be -- they marched.</sentence><sentence id="2568">So they made -- they made a complaint and I was called to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> from -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from the NAACP.</sentence><sentence id="2569">So we were called to listen to the story and they called the man who was the president from their</sentence><sentence id="2571">89 organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoboken</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2572">So th-the story was that he took -- so I told them, he beat me up, I came for the rent.</sentence><sentence id="2573">So he said, "Yes, I beat him up," he was a big, husky guy, "because he came in and h," -- and I told him, "you effing nigger, give me the money."</sentence><sentence id="2574">This -- this what he told them, for this reason he beat me up.</sentence><sentence id="2575">So I ask them, can -- can I ask him a few questions?</sentence><sentence id="2576">Yeah, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2577">I said, What kind of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was it?</sentence><sentence id="2578"><span class="BUILDING">Eight family house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2579">Who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2580">All eight were blacks.</sentence><sentence id="2581">Wer -- what <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> were you living?</sentence><sentence id="2582">He say, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2583">What time of the day was it that I called you this name?</sentence><sentence id="2584">It was eight, nine o'clock at night.</sentence><sentence id="2585">No white people and I was there with my mechanic because we had to fix something.</sentence><sentence id="2586">So I -- I -- I ask him those things, so I said to the people, I said, "Now, do you think that if I will come to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it's a eight family house, all are blacks, he lives on the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span>, nine o'clock at night, and I came in and I will tell him this what he said, and I will be alive, I will be here, huh?"</sentence><sentence id="2587">So they asked then the -- my mechanic, he was Ukrainian, and he said, "I just came in to fix something."</sentence><sentence id="2588">So they thought that he is lying, so on the spot -- on the spot they said you don't belong to the organization any more, you're not a president and you -- we don't believe you.</sentence><sentence id="2589">And I -- so I was very, very pleased with their decision.</sentence><sentence id="2590">And they were mostly -- they were about half Jewish lawyers and half were blacks, because Jews gave them lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="2591">So you see, there was a lot of -- of things in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that I disap - - disapproved, and -- and I liked.</sentence><sentence id="2592">Like I disapproved what they did for black people,</sentence><sentence id="2594">90 because I couldn't believe that there should be a discrimination; after all, we are in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2595">The same thing I didn't want to be discriminated as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Well, those are the things that I have everything in the -- in the -- in the book, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2642">Q: Do you think the world has learned from Holocaust?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2644">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2645">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2646">The world has learned that our environment -- when -- when people who are involved learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so much about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2647">Let's say -- let's talk about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2648">The Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> are a little different now to what's <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2649">They are closer to the <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on account of the Holocaust, because they know that we -- would we have <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the war, probably more than half of Jews will be alive, because they will run out and they will have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go.</sentence><sentence id="2650">They didn't know where to go.</sentence><sentence id="2651">So now, this is like a insurance policy.</sentence><sentence id="2652">A lot of Jews -- well, the young Jews I don't think so, because they think we are in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is mine.</sentence><sentence id="2653">We have <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in our pocket.</sentence><sentence id="2654">And it's not true.</sentence><sentence id="2655">So -- but the other people, the elderly people, they figure well, this a insurance policy that in case something happens we have where to go.</sentence><sentence id="2656">So the whole world didn't learn anything, because as you can see, we have now not on the -- on the so -- so strong as the Holocaust, we had <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span>, we had <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>, we had <span class="COUNTRY">Cambodia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2657">So there are a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> that it was repeated.</sentence><sentence id="2658">It was not so repeated like the Holocaust, like I said to you before.</sentence><sentence id="2659">Why?</sentence><sentence id="2660">Because it's not done by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2663">91 Would the Germans be in those <span class="NPIP">places</span>, it will be done completely.</sentence><sentence id="2664">But those people were not capable to make it so complete as the Germans, because everything what the Germans did, it had to be perfect.</sentence><sentence id="2665">So they did perfect with the Holocaust also.</sentence><sentence id="2666">So -- but they didn't learn in case something happened it will be the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2667">Now, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for instance, there are so many nationalities, but we know the time for McCarthy, I don't know if you remember this, it was almost.</sentence><sentence id="2668">But, there were courageous people who stood up, and they started to bring this in the -- t-to the world and they -- and he was thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="2669">But as -- y-y -- also because it was good times.</sentence><sentence id="2670">God forbid if there will be bad times.</sentence><sentence id="2671">They will look for a scapegoat.</sentence><sentence id="2672">They will look for a scapeg -- and here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, the first scapegoat will be the black.</sentence><sentence id="2673">We have somebody who is behind us.</sentence><sentence id="2674">And the next scapegoat will be a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2675">There is even a story that a Jew -- somebody said to a Jew that all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2676">Everything, all troubles are the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2677">So -- so then he said, well give me one example.</sentence><sentence id="2678">So he said, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2679">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> si -- under the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2680">So he said what you bring the Jews, what have to do ya-ya?</sentence><sentence id="2681">He said, well the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> was destroyed by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iceberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2682">So he said, this what I mean, iceberg, Greenberg, Goldberg, they are all the same.</sentence><sentence id="2683">So this is -- this is -- the man said it and he believed it.</sentence><sentence id="2684">And there is -- and then a other man said about the -- about the Holocaust that all the trouble in the world, all the trouble in the world are on account of the Jews, and account of</sentence><sentence id="2686">92 bicycle riders.</sentence><sentence id="2687">Every trouble what's on the world are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle riders.</sentence><sentence id="2688">And people, when you tell it to them, they look at you and they ask, why bicycle riders?</sentence><sentence id="2689">What have bicycle riders to do with the destructions with this?Nobody'd ask why the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2690">Nobody said what do have the Jew -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, if there is a disaster, the first scapegoat is the Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2691">So nobody -- when you tell the story, and I tell the story to a lot of people, nobody ask yet, why the Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2692">But everybody ask, why the bicycle rider?</sentence><sentence id="2693">So there you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- if the world learned a lesson, the world didn't learn no lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2694">The Jews learned a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2695">The Jews who survived learned a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2696">I don't think that the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> learned a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="2697">There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2698">But the majority Jew, what, they go to W-Wall Street, making money, coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, going -- going to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span>, going to the movie.</sentence><sentence id="2699">Do they think about the Holocaust?</sentence><sentence id="2700">No.</sentence><sentence id="2701">The Holocaust was done for somebody else, and it was done in a other's time, and it is not for them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2764">Q: Very last question, and then I'd like you to sing because --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2765">A: Yeah, yeah, sa -- okay --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2766">Q: -- ""m sure you still have some voice left.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2777">Q: Yes, I know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2779">A: Limprove them materially, and all those things, but it -- it-- there were things that -- that is -- well, like for instance, take now.</sentence><sentence id="2780">Take now, I am very much -- I'm very much disappointed in the results of the elections.</sentence><sentence id="2781">This is just happened yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="2782">Now why am I memb -- why am disappointed?</sentence><sentence id="2783">Because I know in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, in such a democratic <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and I know that the elections were st-stolen, and -- and it's not stolen, I -- there -- some lawyer was on television, he said it was not stolen, it was robbed.</sentence><sentence id="2784">And it was robbed because we know -- now, if you go to a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, and you give them a hundred dollar bill, and you said cha -- exchange it to me for wo -- single ca -- single bills for hundred.</sentence><sentence id="2785">And you go away from the ta -- from the <span class="DLF">window</span> and you start to count, and you see it's only 65 dollars instead hundred.</sentence><sentence id="2786">You will go back and I say, you know you cheated me, you gave me 65.</sentence><sentence id="2787">So what will he say?</sentence><sentence id="2788">He said let me count it over.</sentence><sentence id="2789">And he will count over, he said, he's right.</sentence><sentence id="2790">He will give him extra 35 dollars.</sentence><sentence id="2791">Now here, if it was wrong, if -- if it was right -- so why do they have to be</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2794">94</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2795">afraid it will be counted over?</sentence><sentence id="2796">If it's right, so he's right.</sentence><sentence id="2797">But they didn't count it over because they knew it was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2798">So this I am very much hurt.</sentence><sentence id="2799">Forget about the democrats or republicans.</sentence><sentence id="2800">If it will be the opposite, I will be hurt the same way.</sentence><sentence id="2801">So a thing like this, I am very, very much disappointed.</sentence><sentence id="2802">Disappointed because I love <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I love American democrats e-even if it's not hundred percent, but at least we can speak about it.</sentence><sentence id="2803">In this, you cannot even speak.</sentence><sentence id="2804">And then later the -- the -- the ca -- the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, they make the decision.</sentence><sentence id="2805">The <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> has -- i-is not created to make a decision about elections.</sentence><sentence id="2806">The <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> is made for -- to make decisions about something else.</sentence><sentence id="2807">You see, be-because you ask me, those are the things that just happened yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="2808">So a thing like this, I am disappointed because I feel <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is mine.</sentence><sentence id="2809">It's not a thing that I am living in a strange <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, is a -- ina foreign country like I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2810">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> everything they did, I had to take it for granted, this is
