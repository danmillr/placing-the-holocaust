<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q:What do you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A:Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was stingy.</sentence><sentence id="68">So, we didn't grow up in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> full of beautiful objects.</sentence><sentence id="69">We grew up with whatever was available.</sentence><sentence id="70">Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they were brought up.</sentence><sentence id="71">You get hand me downs.</sentence><sentence id="72">We were five children.</sentence><sentence id="73">There was an older sister <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*370 3 and older brother.</sentence><sentence id="74">Me and my younger sister, so five.</sentence><sentence id="75">I think one of the reasons why I got very orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of wild <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">But intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything.</sentence><sentence id="77">Anything except politics.</sentence><sentence id="78">Politics did not play a role.</sentence><sentence id="79">Religion was a very strange situation because my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so my father was born 1880.</sentence><sentence id="81">My mother was born 1883.</sentence><sentence id="82">I've personally never been in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> then the guide goes and shows me a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q:Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A:I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke.</sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> are not like here, private or public.</sentence><sentence id="104">Every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was public.</sentence><sentence id="105">You went to <span class="BUILDING">public kindergarten</span>, public lower grade, <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span>, whatever and then <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> is <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">To go into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> you had to go at that time into a certain <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which prepared you for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">If you went into a trade, there was another <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">But if you had...If you didn't want to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, I couldn't make it to the <span class="BUILDING">university school</span>, I was too stupid.</sentence><sentence id="109">I jumped from what they call a <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span> into the second class of the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest.</sentence><sentence id="111">What made me very interested in <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*370 4 religion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you either go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> or you could get a girl's education.</sentence><sentence id="112">At that time it was just nothing.</sentence><sentence id="113">And, I was a biker.</sentence><sentence id="114">Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and I biked and I was careless.</sentence><sentence id="115">And they wanted to put me in a certain <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was right around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because then I wouldn't bike so far and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a broken leg or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="116">I got put into that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was a so called <span class="BUILDING">Hervormd Lyceum</span> which is not only Lutheran but it is the <span class="BUILDING">Reformed Lutheran church</span>, so the most Calvinistic sect of the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran church</span> you can be in.</sentence><sentence id="118">That was my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">Then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> moved out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyway, but there comes my religion.</sentence><sentence id="120">My religious background was <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>, Christian.</sentence><sentence id="121">It was prayer every morning and so and so on.</sentence><sentence id="122">And it had some Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="123">I wonder whether they were there because it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">I think they were there because it was a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And so, this is where the Christian background comes from.</sentence><sentence id="126">The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very German that came Christmas around, number one we had a tree.</sentence><sentence id="127">Number two the kids were supposed to recite the Christmas story under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">The oldest kid first and by the time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was there already because I was born in "19.</sentence><sentence id="129">So this was the Christian background.</sentence><sentence id="130">Jews were never mentioned except after "33."33 the first immigrants came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> fleeing Hitler and my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees.</sentence><sentence id="131">We had refugees all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did not grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I had also problems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because they knew <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*370 5 that my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans.</sentence><sentence id="133">They had nicknames for them like in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the Bosches and we called them the Moffen.</sentence><sentence id="134">I was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father.</sentence><sentence id="135">The problem was that he was a professor, that he lectured at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and that he was so ungifted with language that he never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, "Professor Laqueur do us a favor, talk in German because we can't understand you."</sentence><sentence id="136">So, he lectured in German, but wrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time.</sentence><sentence id="137">I think they all still wrote in German.</sentence><sentence id="138">Nobody wrote in English, in medical text.</sentence><sentence id="139">Dutch, you didn't write because nobody could read it, but they wrote German.</sentence><sentence id="140">They changed it.</sentence><sentence id="141">Science was German.</sentence></p></dialogue>
