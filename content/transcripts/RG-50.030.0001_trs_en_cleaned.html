<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: No, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, was segregated between Catholics and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="34">Mind you, it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and I would say the majority of the people in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="35">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us Jewish children and Catholic children.</sentence><sentence id="36">As you know, most of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were Catholic.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster.</sentence><sentence id="70">My father used to subscribe to many <span class="BUILDING">newspapers</span>, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us.</sentence><sentence id="71">However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things.</sentence><sentence id="72">They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="73">In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="74">They really went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> amongst Jews.</sentence><sentence id="75">There were so many of them that people had to help.</sentence><sentence id="76">So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: They told stories of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Definitely, yes.</sentence><sentence id="88">In a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, since it was more or less a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="89">He was not Polish, the guy who was running the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, he was not Jewish, he was Polish.</sentence><sentence id="90">In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> might come to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">It was known between people that he's not going to stop at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted.</sentence><sentence id="100">So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later.</sentence><sentence id="101">A few days before the war they already had black outs in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement.</sentence><sentence id="102">It was about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war.</sentence><sentence id="103">We did not know the particulars of what they signed.</sentence><sentence id="104">The Germans, the <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span>, we anticipated there would be a war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Was there anything that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> did in preparation for this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="116">The Jewish people naturally were very anxious.</sentence><sentence id="117">They already knew what happened to the people.</sentence><sentence id="118">They were thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="119">They already heard of the burnings of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in.</sentence><sentence id="120">It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was going to be defeated.</sentence><sentence id="121">We were aware and the preparation was made in a way.</sentence><sentence id="122">People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come.</sentence><sentence id="123">They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign.</sentence><sentence id="124">They occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and it was benign.</sentence><sentence id="125">In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews.</sentence><sentence id="126">On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="128">So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over.</sentence><sentence id="129">Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not going to be that bad.</sentence><sentence id="130">They did not expect anything very bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking?</sentence><sentence id="148">Were they eager for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come in?</sentence><sentence id="149">Were they prepared to fight them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations.</sentence><sentence id="154">The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="155">That they are really against Jews, the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, naturally at that point they were united.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Do you remember the day that was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: What I remember is one morning, | think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all of a sudden, a great bang in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">A bomb was thrown.</sentence><sentence id="165">We did not know it was a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="166">We all ran out and we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going over.</sentence><sentence id="167">There was near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were German garrison (ph).</sentence><sentence id="168">They tried to bomb the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> but they missed.</sentence><sentence id="169">They bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they announced already that the war had begun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: They tried to bomb a <span class="BUILDING">German garrison</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

work.</sentence><sentence id="1078">I wasn't the only one, in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> they woke up early.</sentence><sentence id="1079">So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I was very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1080">I had to walk up with a load of 40 or 50 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have food and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1082">They were working people,

about 14 years 8 old, and I wasn't too strong either.</sentence><sentence id="1084">So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little bit, but I was still hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1085">What my downfall is, it started with a dog.</sentence><sentence id="1086">These people who ran the <span class="NPIP">place</span> they had their own big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to it.</sentence><sentence id="1087">They were German soldiers and German civilians because most of this was going for the armaments.</sentence><sentence id="1088">They were making <span

good.</sentence><sentence id="1095">So one day, I could always get after he was finished.</sentence><sentence id="1096">If not, he would growl.</sentence><sentence id="1097">That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was Jewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me.</sentence><sentence id="1098">You go taking away the food of the dog.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Don't you get enough food.</sentence><sentence id="1100">I was working there for two weeks, I had no food.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he shamed me in front of them.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way, but , he had <span class="BUILDING">engineering place</span>, all kinds of instruments and a Polish engineer was there and he started hitting me again.</sentence><sentence id="1103">Aren't you ashamed he said.</sentence><sentence id="1104">You're a Jewish boy, to do those things.</sentence><sentence id="1105">When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured that's the end of me.</sentence><sentence id="1106">I grabbed a inch by inch a steel ruler and I grabbed it instantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him.</sentence><sentence id="1107">I escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1108">I could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow, but I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, and I was afraid to go back in.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Then my little brother came out at night.</sentence><sentence id="1110">I was I think sleeping over at my brother's.</sentence><sentence id="1111">He said, don't go there.</sentence><sentence id="1112">The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you might compromise the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1113">I don't know to this day what happened to that man, but I know the glasses and blood was running out.</sentence><sentence id="1114">From then on I became what we call in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, a wild boy.</sentence><sentence id="1115">My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead people on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but everyday hundreds of people would lay down and die.</sentence><sentence id="1118">They couldn't either take it anymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up.</sentence><sentence id="1119">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning, I wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of those half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> everybody you couldn't go away without a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1120">I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Sometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself.</sentence><sentence id="1122">That's how I got breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="1123">Some of the time I was beaten up.</sentence><sentence id="1124">They used to smuggle in potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1125">If something fell I would grab and they would run after me and beat the hell out of me.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Hygiene, very dirty.</sentence><sentence id="1127">There was no place to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="1128">You go around desperate.</sentence><sentence id="1129">So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1130">I didn't run away but to go out for some food.</sentence><sentence id="1131">One incident I want to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1132">So, the situation was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1133">Children, especially elderly people would be laying down there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay or they gave up.</sentence><sentence id="1134">I decided with other kids we're going to take a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1135">They used to take out groups to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went 9 out, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food.</sentence><sentence id="1136">One time, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just the gist of one event.</sentence><sentence id="1137">We're trying to get in and beg for food.</sentence><sentence id="1138">We have learned already a little bit how to greet catholic people in their way.</sentence><sentence id="1139">So, it was about a four or five story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a certain <span class="DLF">gate</span>, and each one of us went to a different <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1140">I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1141">A woman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I had to.</sentence><sentence id="1142">She said to me, "Look, you don't have to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1143">I know who you are."</sentence><sentence id="1144">I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up.</sentence><sentence id="1145">A nice woman and the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water and especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive.</sentence><sentence id="1146">We did not look good.</sentence><sentence id="1147">That's how they recognized us anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1148">So, she said don't worry about it.</sentence><sentence id="1149">Take it off and I'll burn it.</sentence><sentence id="1150">I will cook it.</sentence><sentence id="1151">Then she was cooking for me something like buckwheat.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And they were poor themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1153">She didn't have anything to give other than to cook something.</sentence><sentence id="1154">And I was hungrier than <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">She sat down with me and I think she was a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me.</sentence><sentence id="1156">She said it's such a pity that you Jewish children can not go to kingdom of <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> and he had to bring Hitler a man, the destroyer.</sentence><sentence id="1157">I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up religious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay.</sentence><sentence id="1158">Well, I understand, but what can we do we're hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1159">All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat yet.</sentence><sentence id="1160">I hear a shot.</sentence><sentence id="1161">The superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> must have called up the police, the local police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot.</sentence><sentence id="1162">He was shot in the leg and he fell.</sentence><sentence id="1163">I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, but that woman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1164">So, she took me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, in Europe they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and she put me in there and she locked me up.</sentence><sentence id="1165">She covered me with all kinds of furs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="1166">She was afraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So, she went to the neighbors, and I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1168">I was holding my nose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end.</sentence><sentence id="1169">They'll probably ask the other kid on the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> what happened, where I am who is the other one because the superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids.</sentence><sentence id="1170">Well, I was there, running was water, I thought this is the end of me.</sentence><sentence id="1171">I couldn't breath.</sentence><sentence id="1172">I think I passed out for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1173">All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was a husband and coming back and screaming.</sentence><sentence id="1174">He was a good man, he says look you have to kill us.</sentence><sentence id="1175">He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him.</sentence><sentence id="1176">When they took me out, I didn't go out, I fell out.</sentence><sentence id="1177">But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="1178">Gave me new clothes because my clothes were wet.</sentence><sentence id="1179">He was still cooking and food and everything and at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was very connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food.</sentence><sentence id="1180">He gave me food and everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate.</sentence><sentence id="1181">I had food for two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1182">What I'm trying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, almost dead.</sentence><sentence id="1183">The guy on the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1184">I don't know what happened to the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> whether they took him back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or not.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I never met him.</sentence><sentence id="1186">This kid, the 0 other one, told on me and again I had to change clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1187">I had to make myself all kind of dirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me.</sentence><sentence id="1188">But I was sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who Iam.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I am going to die there.</sentence><sentence id="1191">I went over to my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1192">I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were close.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, some of them recognized, some of them didn't recognize.</sentence><sentence id="1194">I am going to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1195">Whatever happens, happens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids.</sentence><sentence id="1196">So, he says look, tell me something, you go because there's no hope here.</sentence><sentence id="1197">I'll take you through.</sentence><sentence id="1198">The way they took through people was they went to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they could squeeze me, but he was already an educated guy.</sentence><sentence id="1199">He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a Zionist group and I guess he was more or less in underground already.</sentence><sentence id="1200">They had certain connections with people in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over there.</sentence><sentence id="1201">He drew up a map.</sentence><sentence id="1202">You take this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1203">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> going.</sentence><sentence id="1204">There was a rive in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which goes through the whole country.</sentence><sentence id="1205">When you hit under the try to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1206">So, he gave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I had, not much, and to go and get a ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1207">I walked out of the group which went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and ran away.</sentence><sentence id="1208">I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money he had.</sentence><sentence id="1209">He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1210">I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated, I was moving back, because there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> of people, to go or not to go, because I think only older people go and I was just a little kid in between.</sentence><sentence id="1211">So, I moved out, all of sudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me, don't go in there in German they said they'll you.</sentence><sentence id="1212">They will finish you off in German.</sentence><sentence id="1213">I pretended I didn't know a word of German.</sentence><sentence id="1214">So I was saying again in <span class="COUNTRY">Czech</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1215">He got mad and he started talking in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1216">He knew both languages.</sentence><sentence id="1217">He said you get the hell away from here.</sentence><sentence id="1218">They will kill you.</sentence><sentence id="1219">I have an idea after today, he was an angel and he saved me.</sentence><sentence id="1220">But where do I go.</sentence><sentence id="1221">I had a map, about a journey of two days hit the in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and i don't know where to go so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Central Station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1222">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Central Station</span> but my heart was pumping.</sentence><sentence id="1223">I didn't know whether they would recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid attention to me.</sentence><sentence id="1224">I had a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1225">This was early in the morning when I got out, and where do you go.</sentence><sentence id="1226">Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that <span class="DLF">Central Station entrance</span> because there were so many German SS around there checking for 5 which means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are.</sentence><sentence id="1227">They called them ,and I had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1228">Where do you go, so I was just roaming around the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him to a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60 kilometers outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1229">But they had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1230">It wasn't large rails and small and it sort of dragged into that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1231">So I said maybe down there there won't be so many soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1232">And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it get a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1233">So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money 1 and give the conductor.</sentence><sentence id="1235">They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers.</sentence><sentence id="1236">So, I sat down amongst the women.</sentence><sentence id="1237">They were smugglers.</sentence><sentence id="1238">They would smuggle in food to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and buy clothes there.</sentence><sentence id="1239">This was their job.</sentence><sentence id="1240">So amongst them I sat between them they asked me where do you come from?</sentence><sentence id="1241">What are you doing here?</sentence><sentence id="1242">I told them, listen my father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1243">Iam looking for my mother because my father lived in the <span class="REGION">German occupied area</span> and my mother took off and she's supposed to be around this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1244">So, they started giving me salami, food, anything what I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1245">When the conductor came he, they said you don't touch that kid.</sentence><sentence id="1246">In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1247">I don't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what am I doing.</sentence><sentence id="1248">I didn't have a ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1249">I was still scared.</sentence><sentence id="1250">When the rail -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> slowed down and the front of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> it was called and in the front of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were smuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off.</sentence><sentence id="1251">Where do you go now?</sentence><sentence id="1252">I was just running in the direction of the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1253">Dark, I went through a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> up to here, and down across was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and I didn't know, you wouldn't believe it, I was hoping to God and I was sorry I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1254">I was real sorry, because I didn't know where to go.</sentence><sentence id="1255">It was dark, cold, wet.</sentence><sentence id="1256">I couldn't sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1257">In the morning some elderly lady, a woman, was carrying a can of milk to distribute.</sentence><sentence id="1258">I asked here where am I. I spoke very good Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I was very good at it.</sentence><sentence id="1260">She says, first she gave me a little bit milk.</sentence><sentence id="1261">She says you're so wet, what happened?</sentence><sentence id="1262">I said I got in in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I don't know where -- I got lost.</sentence><sentence id="1263">There's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varka</span> (ph), not far, you go there.</sentence><sentence id="1264">I think it was Sunday morning, I figured I'm going to go.</sentence><sentence id="1265">What do you do?I went to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the morning and the sun came out and I dried out and I see all the people are going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, so I went down there to.</sentence><sentence id="1266">I was afraid to stay behind someone else's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I seen a lot of those very old ladies sat down begging and people would give them.</sentence><sentence id="1267">I sat down too, but on the side I wanted to dry out.</sentence><sentence id="1268">One woman came over and said, "What are you doing little boy here between all these old people?"</sentence><sentence id="1269">I said I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1270">I haven't got any money and I have a family.</sentence><sentence id="1271">My father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1272">I used it, I knew it worked.</sentence><sentence id="1273">My father was killed -- they took out pieces of bread they gave me.</sentence><sentence id="1274">Other people said this was an <span class="BUILDING">orphan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1275">His father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1276">They gave me bread and little pieces of sausage.</sentence><sentence id="1277">In the meantime I dried out and they gave me a few dollars, a few .</sentence><sentence id="1278">The first few dollars I had.</sentence><sentence id="1279">They were selling crosses down there in front of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1280">I gave the few dollars to that guy, and I got myself a very large size of across.</sentence><sentence id="1281">I figured it's going to help.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And I continued that day, I stuck around in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1283">I went again, I was afraid to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1284">I was always worried if they ar going to recognize me or not.</sentence><sentence id="1285">I figured if I keep going, I'll be dried out.</sentence><sentence id="1286">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1287">So, I went through like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> the German firm was cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, I think for the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span>, the <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1288">There was a sign that was two days later -- there was sign whoever works will get so many marks.</sentence><sentence id="1289">In the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> they had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> there and it wasn't army.</sentence><sentence id="1290">These were people, it was a company with Germans who were preparing those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and a lot of Poles were working there.</sentence><sentence id="1291">I went over and I asked for a job.</sentence><sentence id="1292">L asked for a job and the woman she spoke German and Polish you know.</sentence><sentence id="1293">To the German she spoke German, to me she spoke Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1294">Don't you think you're a little bit too 2 young.</sentence><sentence id="1295">You had to be sixteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="1296">But I was very skinny too on top of it.</sentence><sentence id="1297">Don't you think you're too young.</sentence><sentence id="1298">You can't work because you're too young.</sentence><sentence id="1299">So, one of the other Germans, a foreman said, and I understood what he was saying, tell me you'll take him in and they'll let him clean up around us.</sentence><sentence id="1300">Clean up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1301">I'm telling you, as soon as she said can you clean a little bit, nobody ever cleaned better than I did.</sentence><sentence id="1302">I did a good job.</sentence><sentence id="1303">Then she asked me do you have anything to show who you are?</sentence><sentence id="1304">I gave the same story, my father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1305">I came from a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="REGION">North Poland</span>, and I have got

chores for him so I didn't have to go back to confessions.</sentence><sentence id="1657">On a whole he was a heck of a nice man, because I used to go every other Sunday to him.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And I worked on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and I did anything people had to do on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and of course, since I was not used to it, it was horrid, but I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="1659">I had food.</sentence><sentence id="1660">The people down there treated me well.</sentence><sentence id="1661">I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed money because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food, clothes, very nice catholic people.</sentence><sentence id="1662">So, I worked for a baker.</sentence><sentence id="1663">I went to work in a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far.</sentence><sentence id="1664">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for a baker, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garbutka</span> (ph).Working for the baker, he was a very nice man, and I

Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1673">I heard that and everything inside of me started shaking.</sentence><sentence id="1674">I did not believe it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1675">I didn't believe it that this could happen, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1676">They're burning -- I looked at him but I said I got very good information that that's what they do to people.</sentence><sentence id="1677">One day they will pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="1678">I was uneasy already, very uneasy.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And I heard, not far from there there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1680">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was --what they did the Germans got together shoemakers, what do you call it, tailors, other let's say people who were good in certain trades.</sentence><sentence id="1681">They got them together, and they worked for the Germans.</sentence><sentence

come to me the baker and he used to hide his shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1683">I think he recognized me that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1684">A very nice man, and he told me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span>, because he used to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, all the shoes, bring them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, make some money and brought them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, made some money and came back.</sentence><sentence id="1685">One day, being in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, something must have happened some provocation or something, the Polish people around there were doing something, the underground which wasn't to the Gestapo liking.</sentence><sentence id="1686">They must have done something bad.</sentence><sentence id="1687">I didn't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1688">All of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1735">A: What I'm trying to tell you is they had some kind --from what I know now, I didn't know then, there was a provocation, the underground, the Polish underground probably robbed or took a lot of food out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which went to the front.</sentence><sentence id="1736">So they brought some kind of punishment, a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing people on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1737">I look out and the priest was even taken in chains.</sentence><sentence id="1738">I was looking out and I figured I'm going to run.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And I think I was running better than Tarzan and I ran, but the wheat was that high and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they did not have big <span class="DLF">estates</span>, just small little parcels of <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1740">So, in between there was one parcel of <span class="REGION">land</span> and the other, there was what they called in Polish , like little <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and they were having a guns machine guns down there.</sentence><sentence id="1741">Anything moves, boom.</sentence><sentence id="1742">I got in between and I want to tell you I was going and I figured this is the end, and I kind of ducked every minutes.</sentence><sentence id="1743">After they shot, I got through.</sentence><sentence id="1744">I finally got through and where do I go now.</sentence><sentence id="1745">I remind myself about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1746">I'm going to run there, and it was about a couple kilometers there.</sentence><sentence id="1747">I was running away in my shorts.</sentence><sentence id="1748">My whole body was full of blood from I was on my chest walking on my chest because I was afraid if I put my head up that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1749">Well, I finally reached that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they let me in.</sentence><sentence id="1750">The Jewish people were watching themselves too.</sentence><sentence id="1751">They didn't know yet, but they had an idea.</sentence><sentence id="1752">They heard all the shooting and I told them what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1753">I told them listen I'm Jewish let me into this group, and I told him about that man who used to hold my shoes down there.</sentence><sentence id="1754">Sure enough they went in there and he came in and took me into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1755">It was very early.</sentence><sentence id="1756">I was a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="1757">Everybody was sleeping yet.</sentence><sentence id="1758">His wife, he woke up his wife to wash me up, because I was full of blood, and I was sitting figuring, what kind of life was that.</sentence><sentence id="1759">I was really disgusted.</sentence><sentence id="1760">I could have been killed a couple hours ago.</sentence><sentence id="1761">All of a sudden I seen the same German marching in on this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1762">I was a stranger and sitting behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> and people were still sleeping behind every little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> seven Germans, SS men would stand there, their guns pulled out and one of them, all of a sudden I saw that this must be the end.</sentence><sentence id="1763">But I was behind the <span class="DLF">door</span>, a stranger, and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1764">They went to every <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and all of a sudden one of them walks in and said all the men out.</sentence><sentence id="1765">I never knew that so many men were in one little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2369">Q: Is there anything else you think should be recorded about this whole experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2371">A: To record I could just tell you one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2372">The worst for me was the Ghetto <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2373">It was worse than <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2374">You couldn't imagine -- <span class="NPIP">hell</span> was worse.</sentence><sentence id="2375">I can't imagine that the people could be surrounded, not fed, children my age and worse was smaller children, were just laying in the <span class="DLF">street</span> begging for food, dying and no body even paid attention.</sentence><sentence id="2376">They just picked them up in groups, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and they you know when I look I wonder right now, always my heart goes out for them.</sentence><sentence id="2377">Because what I saw over there, I saw the real stuff, I can relate that to what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="2378">But the worst was the older people, the epidemic of typhus.</sentence><sentence id="2379">I want you to know I had typhus at certain time, we skipped.</sentence><sentence id="2380">I had typhus too, but it was <span class="NPIP">hell on earth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2381">The worst was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, was <span class="NPIP">hell on earth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2382">To give you an example, I want to say something.</sentence><sentence id="2383">After the war I always looked in the eyes of German women.</sentence><sentence id="2384">Why.</sentence><sentence id="2385">You'll ask me because I saw one girl, one woman, I'm going to relate it to an incident.</sentence><sentence id="2386">I know already hungry kids, we knew which are good Germans, w which are bad Germans, who's going photograph us and they used to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, like tourist, show how Jewish people are dirty, how they live in poverty, how they just are a heap of people who wouldn't be so bad to kill.</sentence><sentence id="2387">That was their real idea.</sentence><sentence id="2388">One day like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> opened in small little like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pickup</span> and I looked at it from far.</sentence><sentence id="2389">Everytime a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German pickup</span> like this came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, everybody ran because you never know when they're going to catch up, but I was a little from far I could recognize these were airmen.</sentence><sentence id="2390">They were airmen so I figured I'll wait and I'll beg for bread.</sentence><sentence id="2391">I wait up there and they stopped and they want to make pictures.</sentence><sentence id="2392">I thought very good come a little close.</sentence><sentence id="2393">So, I said they can't photograph me unless they throw me a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2394">So one girl came a little close and she grabbed me and hit me right between the eyes.</sentence><sentence id="2395">A girl, must have been a husband or boyfriend, a German soldier, says "Now tell me why did you do that.</sentence><sentence id="2396">He's just a little boy," to that woman, and I'll never forget her.</sentence><sentence id="2397">After the war I was looking in the eyes of every German girl and I couldn't understand why a German woman, maybe she was 18, 19 you know something like this, why she would do it to me and I didn't get any bread and I wouldn't take any bread because to me shame was worse than hunger.</sentence><sentence id="2398">Then they went on, but she really gave it to me.</sentence><sentence id="2399">What got into those people.</sentence><sentence id="2400">What kind of people were they?</sentence><sentence id="2401">Either they were barbarians or they were just got out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and to go ahead and hate, make us miserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery.</sentence><sentence id="2402">They brought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I would say prepare the stage where they could kill us because we are not worthy living and they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2403">No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be 4 clean nothing but sickness, people dying on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they couldn't understand, they would not believe that they could do it to us.</sentence><sentence id="2404">They didn't believe that the German would eventually kill all of them.</sentence><sentence id="2405">They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the people of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education, making them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured that these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm sure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
