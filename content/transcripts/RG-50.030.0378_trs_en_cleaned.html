<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Good afternoon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: I'd like to start by having you tell us your name when you were born and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is George Havas, I was born in 1929 and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>'s name was Mukachevo (aka Munkacz in Hungarian).</sentence><sentence id="10">At that time it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and how many things you remember, earliest things you remember as a small child about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, what it looked like, what the environment was like there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Town</span> was, I should mention it's part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span>, the population was about between 28 and 30,000 and kind of old fashioned by today's standards and about half of the population was Jewish, other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> were Hungarian and Ruthenian and at that time when I was born, there were also Czechs living there, the Czechs were the administrative people and the officers in the army.</sentence><sentence id="16">There were many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, at various levels, there were maybe four or five <span class="BUILDING">elementary schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">Some of them were let's say, Hungarian or Czech or I think there was only one all <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span>, I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there were also many <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and also a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew High School</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were lined, many of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were lined with <span class="BUILDING">shops</span>, all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, they were selling everything possible, like textiles, fabrics, clothing, shoes, shirts and porcelain, anything you wanted you could buy there.</sentence><sentence id="19">There were also various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, like there was a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco factory</span>, there were, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">match factory</span> and there was <span class="BUILDING">alcohol factory</span> and people worked in the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> and there were also various classes of people, I mean lower class, middle class and the professionals, there were many, many doctors, many attorneys and poorer people and all kinds of people.</sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was surrounded by many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">The tural people brought in produce and vegetables, chickens and things of that sort and that was <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days and they used to come in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and sell things at a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> or sometimes you could buy things from them on the <span class="DLF">street</span> as they were going towards the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and everything was fresh and from producer to consumer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="30">Q: And your family, tell me about your parents.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: My father was a doctor and he had a general practice.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: What was his name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Leo Havas.</sentence><sentence id="35">And most of his patients were from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, sometimes somebody was seriously sick, they put him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with either horses or oxen and just dragged him into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and brought him to the doctor and it was like a different century from the way things are today.</sentence><sentence id="36">There were, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there many have been four people who had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">The rest of the people just walked, the 01:06 most common way of going anywhere was by walking, if you had to go to some distance, you hired a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>, a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">And there was a place in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where these were lined up and while they were waiting they were eating hay, the horses and the drivers were just lounging around or sitting around.</sentence><sentence id="39">If you wanted to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which was 42 kilometers away, where my father's parents lived and we used to go ona Sunday to a section on <span class="DLF">Main Street</span> where there were taxicabs, these were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> and sometimes we used to get together with some other people and hire one and go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and just to wait for us and certain time we came back with them.</sentence><sentence id="40">So just 42 kilometers which is like, I don't know, maybe 35 miles, was an adventure, going somewhere that distance.</sentence><sentence id="41">Or let's say if you wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, which was at the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>, sometimes people used to hire a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to go there [with the] to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">Plus you had suitcases, so it was simpler to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and go over there that way.</sentence><sentence id="43">I don't know if you want me to tell you about the Czechs, they were interesting, I mean it was, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was at that time, perhaps the only democratic or the most democratic country in <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span>, but again it was, the Czechs were running the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were, there were Czechs and there were other nationalities but the officers and the government were mainly in the hands of the Czechs.</sentence><sentence id="44">Once, supposedly when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> joined the republic, which was in 1919, they were promised autonomy but the Czechs never gave it to them because the Czechs never considered anybody else capable of running his own affairs except themselves.</sentence><sentence id="45">And same within <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> too, the Slovaks were living in their own <span class="REGION">area</span>, but 01:08 many of the positions were held by Czechs and of course Slovaks resented it and to some extent I suppose the Ruthenians also resented it and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathians</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: But as a child growing up in the thirties, how did this division manifest itself, how were you made aware of it?</sentence><sentence id="61">Or were you aware of it at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: It was I could say a schizoid existence, I mean since the Czechs were the ruling caste, you might say, my father wanted me to become Czech, which, he didn't realize it and I only found out let's say decades after the war that you cannot become Czech, I mean you can be a citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but you have to be born in the <span class="DLF">Czech lines</span> and you have to be Czech several generations back to be a Czech.</sentence><sentence id="65">And at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Hungarian, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I spoke Czech and I had Czech friends and with whom I spoke Czech, since I spoke both languages fluently, like kids do usually, without accents and it was kind of, I was trying to be a Czech with the Czechs and at the same time speaking Hungarian at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which sort of was, as I said before, kind 01:10 of a schizoid existence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: Did the Czechs behave differently, did your Czech friends have different attitudes about things than your Hungarian friends?</sentence><sentence id="70">Did they do different things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: The Hungarian friends were not Hungarians, they were Jewish, see it goes way back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was originally part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> and part of, within <span class="COUNTRY">Austria Hungary</span>, it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and anybody who wanted to exist at that time, or get ahead had to learn Hungarian and that's where the Jews became sort of broken up.</sentence><sentence id="74">The ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> continued speaking Yiddish, the ones who wanted to get ahead learned Hungarian and just by that fact alone, they became separated from those who didn't and if let's say my father wanted to go to, first he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> before he went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were at that time Hungarian language, there was only Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="75">And then came the war and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> became, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was divided up and the part where we were became <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> eventually, so there were these different nationalities.</sentence><sentence id="76">Some Jews consider themselves Hungarian because they spoke Hungarian and they just thought they were Hungarian and some just considered themselves Jewish and would say if there was a census, they said they are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="77">Some Jews consider 01:12 themselves Czechs, but as I told you they would have considered themselves Czechs but they were really not accepted by the Czechs.</sentence><sentence id="78">And on the same thing, my father was more or less encouraging me to be friendly with Czech boys and I felt comfortable with them but there was this conflict that you speak in different language at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you speak a different language with us, so what are you really?</sentence><sentence id="79">And then he wanted me to joina Czech gymnastic society which was called Sokol, which was very nationalistic.</sentence><sentence id="80">It has a long tradition in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span>, the <span class="REGION">Czech lands</span>, and they admitted me for the exercises, but they kept forever postponing, giving me membership certificate or a membership booklet or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="81">And all kinds of excuses, but they wouldn't give it to me.</sentence><sentence id="82">And the other thing was lots of the Czechs did not like Jews, but the big difference was that the Czechs did not persecute us.</sentence><sentence id="83">That's one thing not to like Jews and that's the next step is to hate Jews, then the next step is to kill Jews and so there was a big difference, but already by the age of maybe five or six, I knew that some people hated me just for being Jewish and that's the kind of world 01:14 it was.</sentence><sentence id="84">Let's say I knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I knew about Nazis before I was even six and possibly I knew more than kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> because I was exposed to more things and we had a radio and we had newsreels, newsreels in the movies, and more contact with things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Were these things a topic of discussion in your family constantly, too, because . .</sentence><sentence id="100">.Did your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Not constantly, but it was.</sentence><sentence id="104">Things were talked about and let's say maybe I had bigger ears than some other kids and I overheard many things and I listen in on things and the word Nazi was in the dictionary, I mean in our spoken dictionary and I knew that word, I did not know it's full meaning, but I knew that word you might say as early as six.</sentence><sentence id="105">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Czech elementary school</span>, one of the courses which they were teaching us was Civil Air Defense and they showed us films of gas bombings, fire bombings and things of that sort and how to defend against those kinds of things, so let's say maybe at an age of eight or nine, I was already exposed to those kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="106">Children at that same age in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, they never heard of things like that.</sentence><sentence id="107">| remember film where they were showing us the effect of a certain poison gas and the person was vomiting like a white foam was coming out of his mouth, I mean I knew about the effects, I mean like simulating things and things of that sort so I couldn't understand how they made that person vomit or how they could make that white come out of his mouth but they were showing films of that sort and so it was war time even before there was a war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: You had a sense of being vulnerable because you were Jewish or just that there was something out there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Getting back to the <span class="BUILDING">Sokols</span>, the Sokols were not fond of Jews, but they let me exercise there, whereas once I was participating in something at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and part of it was putting up a dance, a group of us kids had to dress up in a certain way and we were doing some Czech national dance or Slovak national dance and I wanted to change clothes to get into that special outfit and some Czech boys were there in <span class="BUILDING">scout tents</span> and my father was with me so one of them, with great reluctance, let me change in his <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and told us we don't want Jews in our scouts, and Czech scouts did not admit Jews, so I was aware of differences and I was aware that certain things were not accessible to me because of my religion.</sentence><sentence id="116">And in the same time I had to learn to read Hebrew for the services in <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and how will you be ready for Bar Mitzvah if you don't learn it and this and that and my grandmother was religious and all four of my grandparents were religious so I was brought up in that tradition, I had great difficulty in reading Hebrew, to read Hebrew and it was just, I mean as a kid, the letters are different, the words don't mean anything and it was not taught as a living language at that time and it just for me was very difficult but somehow the kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, they learned it and they could read it like fast and recite the prayers fast and 01:19 I never managed to acquire that, so they were way ahead of us on that front.</sentence><sentence id="117">And then, I'd say our first contact, I mean first thing which affected us, which we noticed was when the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, there were some refugees came to live in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and if you look on the map of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, it changed suddenly, suddenly the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> was surrounded by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it was just foreboding and we sort of knew, we had the idea that we would be next, but nobody wanted to believe and everybody was hoping that it wouldn't happen somehow.</sentence><sentence id="118">Plus <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had treaties, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had a defense treaty with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, so we thought we were safe, that the French would protect us and the British would protect the French and the Czechs also had some kind of treaties with the Soviet Union but there were catches in that like the Soviet Union would come to the help of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> if <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was attacked.</sentence><sentence id="119">I think, the catch was only if <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> first came to our assistance.</sentence><sentence id="120">The second problem was that <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had no direct <span class="DLF">border</span> with the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="121">The direct, closest <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> would not permit the passage of Russian units across it's <span class="REGION">territory</span> to 01:21 help <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, under no circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="122">So it was a weird situation.</sentence><sentence id="123">And backtracking a little bit, for some weird reason about two weeks ago or so, I had a nightmare which brought back that experience.</sentence><sentence id="124">It was just put away out of my mind.</sentence><sentence id="125">In "37 or "36, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span> in the summer for a short vacation and we met there some German people.</sentence><sentence id="126">It was a German couple and they had two sons and I was there with my mother and with my cousin, my father stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he had to work and earn money.</sentence><sentence id="127">And somehow these people did not know that we were Jewish and they were using our, sharing our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabana</span> at the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and on one occasion the man took me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and washed off my feet and then he was going to bring me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabana</span> so my feet wouldn't get sand on them and I don't know how, which supposedly was not my habit, but I let my pants down or something and he noticed that I was Jewish and that ended our relationship or our contact and the next day or maybe that same day, the two boys beat me up for no reason, they just slapped me and slugged me and my face was burning red from the beating and I'd say that was my first beating I got for being Jewish and I was at that time maybe seven or eight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Do you remember what your mother said, or what she did?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: She wasn't with me, she was up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they sort of caught me while I was near that pension or something on the <span class="DLF">pathway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">There was nothing she could do, I think she</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="148">01:24 complained to the man and the man just shrugged it, oh that's just kid stuff or just nothing and__, don't worry about it, but after that we had no contact with them or they had no contact with us.</sentence><sentence id="149">They were willing to dry themselves and change clothes any odd way but they were no longer using our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabana</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">And I forgot this, I mean a person forgets things and I, as I said I don't know what brought it back to my mind now, but I could feel my face burning like it did at that time, like it was, what 1936 or "37, which is what, 60 years, 59, 60 years.</sentence><sentence id="151">Then everything changed in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="152">The Sudeten Germans started agitating, first they wanted concessions from the Czechs, they wanted to have their own language, they wanted to have more rights, more self-government and things of that sort and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in which they, they had <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span>, so it's hard to really point out what more they wanted, all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="153">They reached a point where it boiled down to what they really want is to detach that whole <span class="REGION">area</span> where they lived and have that <span class="REGION">area</span> joined to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to the Third Reich, to Nazi Germany.</sentence><sentence id="154">There was no more negotiation after that and there were, the whole thing was orchestrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and managed from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then eventually the French, in a cowardly way and dishonest way, they let <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> down, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, Daladier, the French Prime Minister and Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister and they sold us out and that treason, that betrayal, it's permanently in the Czech history, no matter what those would do, those two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, the Czechs or <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, it could not be erased.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Do you remember when that happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Yes, it was in the summer of "38 we were no longer, we would have liked to go again to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seacoast</span>, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span>, that was canceled.</sentence><sentence id="165">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, to, I don't know what you want to call it, a <span class="DLF">spa</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trencin</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="166">01:27 (Teplitsa).</sentence><sentence id="167">On the way in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we could see from the <span class="DLF">window</span> that fortifications were being built, which was the <span class="DLF">border</span> facing <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and the Czechs were fortifying that <span class="DLF">border</span>, the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span>, <span class="REGION">Moravia</span>, which faced <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was already well fortified, but they continued building more and more and more fortifications and we knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="168">In early September, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> declared mobilization and my father was, same as all other men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, were called into service.</sentence><sentence id="169">All of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mobilized.</sentence><sentence id="170">According to the plan, my father had to report to some underground hospital in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brno</span>, which is in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and there were just, the only men in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were like, according to what the American called 4-F's, who were not fit for military service.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Do you remember when he left?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: No, I don't remember when he left, but I remember that he was gone and I remember when he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I remember that our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> to start with, a large <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>, it was traditionally a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison town</span> and there were many <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> there and going way back, probably to the day of the Austra-Hungarian times and the Czechs continued that tradition and there were many military units in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all the time and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> happened to be on a main <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we could always see the soldiers either marching or rolling on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> moving and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was shaking when those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were going by on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so and they were very proud of them, they were, we kids were proud of the Czech army and we had confidence in the Czech army, in the Czechoslovak army and our weapons, I mean we knew we were well equipped and the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was that way, we had what I suppose the Americans would call spunk, we had self confidence and we had determination and that's when, during the mobilization, the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> was increased.</sentence><sentence id="173">There were many, many soldiers and what, the day a mobilization is carried out, let's say, people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> were assigned to units in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span>, people from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> were assigned to units in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and so forth, everything is mixed so it would, people from <span class="REGION">local areas</span> would be in different <span class="REGION">areas</span> and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was full of let's say soldiers from let's say <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and training and going by on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were modern, some of them had 10 wheels on them, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">terrain vehicles</span>, for all kinds of terrain and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabs</span> had holes in them for emptying out the machine guns, so it 01:31 was, equipment was contemporary, modern and the troops couldn't move and some, many of the troops were also Cavalry and the artillery were horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">But much of it was mechanized, much of it was motorized, so it was a modern army.</sentence><sentence id="175">And that's when this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> came, it

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: It was the sadness, a horrible sadness and people, some of them, people were from, the teachers were from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Moravia</span> and some of their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were being taken over, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, by the Germans and one blow followed another.</sentence><sentence id="184">This was, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> took place at September 30th.</sentence><sentence id="185">And then the Hungarians kept, started pressuring for the return of <span class="REGION">territory</span>, what they call return, which were Hungarian population .</sentence><sentence id="186">And our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> happened to have a sizable Hungarian population and there was, on November 2nd there was a conference at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, because the Czechs and Hungarians couldn't agree among themselves, which <span class="REGION">territory</span> should be given over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, so this was turned over to the Foreign Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they drew the <span class="DLF">border line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">And on the evening of November 2nd, a radio was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, so we were having supper in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> so we could be near the radio and hear the news and they started reading off the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, going from west to east, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> will be turned over to the Hungarians and he's reading <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kosice</span>, which is already <span class="REGION">eastern Slovakia</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzhgorod</span>, which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span>, 43 kilometers to the west of us and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukatchevo</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranog(ph</span>) and when he said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukatchevo</span>), which is our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, my father virtually choked on his food, because he, let's say, put, in old expression, all his money on the Czechs.</sentence><sentence id="188">He was trying to bring us up as Czechs, we were trying to be Czech and he knew the Hungarians from experience he had before, after World War 1, during World War 1, and it was a total shock for him and he changed and our whole life changed as a result of that, let's say, the Hungarians called it they are liberating us.</sentence><sentence id="189">To us it was they are occupying us and that took place on November 10th, eight days after what was called the Vienna arbitrage.</sentence><sentence id="190">The last Czech units pulled out around two in the afternoon, it was a beautiful, sunny day, mild and the last to leave were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and it was just, to me, to us, it was a heartbreaking scene.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: My father was shaking like, I supposed that they might taken him because he was friendly towards the Czechs and now the Czechs are gone and they're going to get even with anybody who was friendly towards the Czechs and who was not a loyal Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="220">If you're a local person, you should be loyal to the Hungarians, you had no business kowtowing to the Czechs and they didn't take him, but we heard rumors and all kinds of things that the people were badly beaten, that they were tortured and there was one name whom I remember, who vanished.</sentence><sentence id="221">And he was later, some drunk Hungarian gendarme said, oh he had a tough skull, but we cracked it never the less.</sentence><sentence id="222">And nobody spoke about it and nobody knew about it and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> later on, we heard that, behind what they called the gendarmerie(ph) <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, there were people buried.</sentence><sentence id="223">There were no arrest warrants, there were no records or anything and so they could do most anything.</sentence><sentence id="224">That was a word which may be strange to you, gendarmerie, well in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there were police, in the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> they called them gendarmerie and they had different uniforms and different customs and that's what they were called and again, it was tradition in Europe, all the way maybe, entire 01:40: central and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and even <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> and even in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> there were rural police and there were in-town police and they were different.</sentence><sentence id="225">And it was just a completely new world, it was terror and fear and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Did your father continue to have his <span class="BUILDING">medical practice</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: There was a man in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who was the leading Hungarian during the Czech regime, while it was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and he sort of kept, did the equivalent of what the Sudeten Germans did in the <span class="REGION">Sudeten area</span>, in other words, the resistance to the Czechs and agitating towards the Czechs, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and when the Hungarians came in he became, let's say king.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: What was his name, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Oh, yeah, his name was Vazari, Vazari, Aladar and he and my father were enemies, so naturally as soon as the thing changed, it was extremely bad for my father.</sentence><sentence id="241">All the doctors had to report to king Vazari and explain their misdeeds during the Czech occupation and sort of show, I'm guessing, let's say what you might call show cause why you should be permitted to continue practice as a doctor, why you should be admitted to 0 be a Hungarian or something of that sort, why you should still have your license or something like that, and I don't know how many doctors from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> got called in, maybe 20 out of 50 or, I don't know, but my father was among them.</sentence><sentence id="242">Let's say 19 of the 20 were certified, the only one who wasn't was my father, out of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was, as far as I can remember, there 01:43 was no appeal or there, maybe he tried some appeal and tried to drag out something, but the final word came down, you are not permitted to practice, take off the signs from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father continued practicing illegally, clandestinely or secretly, I don't know which way you want to phrase it or put it.</sentence><sentence id="243">And it was stress, it was stress on him and stress was passed on to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Before you go on, do you have any idea what kinds of activities your father was engaged in that could have caused this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Just being, trying to pass as a Czech, having sent his children to <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span>, when there was a good <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> available, I mean quote, unquote, good.</sentence><sentence id="252">The <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> was the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">Why did you send your children to <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> and again, in the <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span>, we had, at the end of the year we had what in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is called a report card, but over there it was a sheet of paper, on which was the name of the student and I believe that among other things which was written at the top was name, date of birth, was also the nationality and I think that I was entered there as Czech and the Czechs did not protest, you say you're a Czech, fine, put him down a Czech, but when the Hungarians came in and I had to transfer to <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span>, I had to show the certificate from the previous year, at which year I was, at which level I was, so I would be placed in the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> and the person who was in charge there was again, a very loyal Hungarian, loyal from the Hungarian point of view, who saw to it that the certificate is turned into the hands of Vazari(ph) and it's, clearly it says here that this child was declared as Czech and not only that, my younger brother, he had a middle name, a Czech middle name, in addition.</sentence><sentence id="254">His name was Robert, but to make it Czech-er, my father added <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, which was not common over there, nobody had middle names, it was very uncommon.</sentence><sentence id="255">And so it wasn't enough for him to be listed as a Czech, he even gave him a Czech name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Was he, to your knowledge, involved in any kinds of political activities or outspoken in any way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: No, he wasn't outspoken.</sentence><sentence id="264">01:46:</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: He was not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: No, he was, to my great surprise, he told me once, years later, during the occupation, I got to talking to him about the Czech parties, political parties.</sentence><sentence id="272">In 1934 there were elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and the strongest party was the Agrarian, the number one and I remember the name social democrats and the name of maybe one other party and there was even a Zionist party and they managed to get one man into the <span class="BUILDING">Czech parliament</span>, so I said, did you vote for the Agrarian?</sentence><sentence id="273">He says, no, they were crooks.</sentence><sentence id="274">I said, did you vote for the social democrats, he said no.</sentence><sentence id="275">So I was at the end of my list, I said, well what did you vote for?</sentence><sentence id="276">The Communists, they were the only honest ones.</sentence><sentence id="277">And later on I found out that he cooperated with the Communists, when the Communists were beaten up by the Czech police in some kind of a demonstration or something, they used to take him clandestinely through <span class="DLF">back streets</span>, to the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>, where he was treating them, giving them first aid or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="278">But far as I know, that was secret, nobody knew about that.</sentence><sentence id="279">You asked me about early memories and going back, backtracking, probably one of the earliest ones, again looking out from our <span class="DLF">windows</span>, where the first of many demonstrations, thousands and thousands of people were marching every first of May.</sentence><sentence id="280">And just marching with banners and on both sides, Czech police with nightsticks, escort, but it was just amazing how many people were, I don't know how to phrase it, let's say loyal to that cause, how many people identified with that cause and every year people in clean clothes and spruced up and people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> had red paper ribbons in the wheels and the spokes and red banners and bands and marching bands.</sentence><sentence id="281">The bands from the <span class="BUILDING">tobacco factory</span> workers and all those and it was just interesting, I don't know how else to put it and it was, it was accepted.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: It was tolerated by ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: No, it was not tolerated, it was part of the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">The Communist Party was outlawed in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">Soon as the Hungarians took over, they got hold of those people who were leaning Communist and they went after those and they beat them, they arrested them and then the first chance they had they tried them and they imprisoned them, when they already got to that stage.</sentence><sentence id="298"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had, see I'm jumping back and forth, it's impossible to keep everything in chronological order and sequences.</sentence><sentence id="299"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had an interesting way, it had a regular army and it also had an 01:50: army like an SS army.</sentence><sentence id="300">It wasn't SS, it was like an army of volunteers which went on attacks against <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when it was still, originally <span class="REGION">Czech territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">They used to infiltrate across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">They tried to kill Czech soldiers, they tried to blow up things and they tried to, various sabotage acts and things of that sort, but where as they had, the Germans did identical things in the <span class="REGION">Sudeten area</span>, they blew up <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span>, they killed people who were, let's say German socialists or Czechs or stuff like that and they attacked <span class="DLF">Czech border posts</span>, they attacked <span class="DLF">Czech customs posts</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Czech gendarmerie stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">Well the Hungarians tried to do the same thing except they were not successful 2 and the Czechs intercepted them, captured them and imprisoned them and held them and tortured them and who knows what they did to them, but once the Vienna Arbitrage came and the Hungarians took over, they had to turn them loose, they had to release all these prisoners, but they continued their activities even during a time of war, there were organizations which let's say -- one day our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, I don't know what to call it, raided or something.</sentence><sentence id="304">You look out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> as always, it was a custom then, always looking out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> to see what's going on and the <span class="DLF">street</span> is blocked off.</sentence><sentence id="305">Hungarian soldiers with rifles and bayonets and some kind of people are going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searching.</sentence><sentence id="306">And they come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they search like bandits, I mean like robbers or like police here, I mean police are same in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">Pulling out all <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span>, turning over the drawers and there were some, always used to go into all the <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and always looking for things and pictures and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="308">My father or my mother had a stack of postcards, picture postcards and I always used to go through those, but there was some <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span> which they wouldn't let me in and now everything was tossed open, everything was lying there.</sentence><sentence id="309">And it was like bandits coming into your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and tossing things about in front of your own eyes, with absolute authority and we had, you didn't know what was coming out of it and my younger brother had a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he outgrew that too, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was just put into an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, thinking of empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> again, sidetracking, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> became empty because we sold the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, hoping to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">So we sold the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, one with a big <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and fancy one which we only used on state occasions, when the American family came to visit us, we had dinner there and the other one was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was in there and for some reason, my father kept that math book from the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> and he stuck it into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and when they came searching, they tossed everything apart and they came on the book.</sentence><sentence id="311">Says, what is this?</sentence><sentence id="312">And he says, it's a math book.</sentence><sentence id="313">Says, but it's not Hungarian, what is it and I says it's Czech.</sentence><sentence id="314">Are you hoping that the Czechs will be coming back here?</sentence><sentence id="315">So, I mean it was a hostile world, it was a, it just, very, very bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> and 01:55: I don't know, they couldn't find anything else so they found we had too many bars of soap, toilet soap.</sentence><sentence id="316">Says, what is this?</sentence><sentence id="317">Toilet soap.</sentence><sentence id="318">And this?</sentence><sentence id="319">Says, what do you need so much toilet soap for?</sentence><sentence id="320">Says, pack up these two boxes and turn them in to us.</sentence><sentence id="321">And they went through other <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> the same way, taking away this, taking away that and the next day, people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, who had bigger mouths than my father or who had better positions or more, let's say, just one comparison, saying Doctor __is still practicing, or was still permitted to practice, people in that class or in that category.</sentence><sentence id="322">They went to the mayor and they complained that this was taken away or that.</sentence><sentence id="323">We had nothing to do with this, we didn't even know about this, I mean this was, we had nothing to do with this.</sentence><sentence id="324">And then we will investigate this.</sentence><sentence id="325">Investigated, investigated, oh this was a completely illegal thing, we didn't know who did this, we don't know who did this.</sentence><sentence id="326">I mean they get, the soldiers get assigned to them to carry out the blocking off of the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, the guarding of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and all that stuff, but nobody knows how it happened or who had the 3 authority or who pulled it or what.</sentence><sentence id="327">So it was a, as I said, it was a government in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and there was a quasi-government or something, which could do all kinds of things and get away with it and be tolerated and be funded.</sentence><sentence id="328">I mean, they were drawing their pay and all that stuff from certain secret funds, let's say the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="379">Oh, another thing, the Hungarians came in, as soon as they came in it was already, a law was debated in Parliament which was called the anti-Jewish law, I mean they didn't call it anti-Jewish, they called it the Jewish law, but it was an anti-Jewish law, which would deprive Jews from being, it was similar to the Nuremberg laws in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Jews could not be in this aspect of public life, Jews could not be that, Jews could not be here, they could not be journalists, they could not be university professors, if they wanted to go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there would be a quota, like six percent, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="380">Jews could not have licenses to have <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, it's just, all kinds of restrictions and depriving people of a livelihood, expropriating <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, <span class="BUILDING">shops</span>, property, means of trade and all kinds of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="381">And it was a different world.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: At the end of the last tape, you were beginning to describe how the Hungarians laws, as they pertained to Jewish people, affected your family and would you please go into that in more detail?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Well, let's say for one thing the Hungarians had a similar thing to the Hitler Jugend_, which was called Leventer(Ph) and everybody was all, any kid over 12 year old had to be in it, it was like a pre-military training, but did not involve any weapons or anything at that point yet, it was mainly sort of to be in a group, be in an organization, be under command, be drilled, perform together, march together and things of that sort and again, let's say I should say that I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Gymnasium</span>, which is <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span>, and I became, in 1939 I was 10 and it was, for me it was a big step in life, going from <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> to this,big, <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span>, which was an eight year school and I went there for the first two years and my father had the notion that I should do very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so I could get into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and in that respect he was quite unrealistic and quite, just wouldn't accept the world as it was because no matter what kind of grades I would have gotten in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the chances of my getting into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> with my father being not on the top, on the accepted list or preferred list was virtually nil.</sentence><sentence id="397">Second, we should have, 02:04: in "38 when the clouds were coming in over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, we were thinking of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where my mother had four brothers and they were willing to send us, they did send us what they were called, affidavits, which could, might get us visas to come here, immigration visas, but my father was reluctant to leave his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which meant so much to him and leave his <span class="BUILDING">practice</span>, I'm still talking about 1938, he didn't see into the future, none of us did and he did not know that it would become <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and he thought it would stay <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> forever.</sentence><sentence id="398">And his main argument was that he didn't want to work in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as an orderly until he could get his board certification or whatever was needed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to become a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="399">And so he was hard on me to excel in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and study hard and I mentioned that we had a class of about 35 or 40 students in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">class</span> which I entered and out of those there were five or six of us Jews.</sentence><sentence id="400">And four out of the five were leading students, I mean we were hustling and we were working hard and getting the grades.</sentence><sentence id="401">This was, I entered in "39 and in 1940 I entered the second class and before I finished the second class rumors started circulating that Jews will not be permitted to continue in this <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian state gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and from now on, any Jewish boy who wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, will go to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">And came 1941 and my father came in to register and they said yes, well, but you knew that we were not admitting any more Jews to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so my father pretended he didn't know that, that's all?</sentence><sentence id="404">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="405">So during that time when I had this warning, I started learning Hebrew, the modern Hebrew, which was the official language of the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="406">So he had another new language for me and I already had 5 Latin, was studying Latin and this and that and again Hebrew was again very hard for me, I don't know why, it just was hard and I had to learn it from beginning, we had to get hold of books which covered the elementary Hebrew and to get up to this level which was the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="407">And not only was Hebrew being taught as a language, physics was taught in Hebrew, Algebra was taught in Hebrew, so it was a new ballgame as they say and it was not easy.</sentence><sentence id="408">And we had to join this Levnter_ and if you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you participated in it at your <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so I was now in the third year of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and I was part of Leventer_ and the instructor came to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all over 12 were put into a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> and were lecturing to us about, let's say about nothing and we were going down into the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> and doing calisthenics there and stuff like that, but they didn't last long.</sentence><sentence id="409">After a while they decided that there will be no more Jews in the Hungarian army, they will all be in labor units and instead of having Hungarian military uniforms, they will be wearing their own civilian clothes and they will be wearing a 10 centimeter wide, yellow armband, to make sure that everybody knows that they are Jewish and maybe in the beginning they still had military caps, but that was the only thing on them, the cap and the yellow armband.</sentence><sentence id="410">Same way, no more Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">Leventer</span>, from now on yellow armband on anybody from 12 years up and you will be in pre-labor units.</sentence><sentence id="411">So in all case it meant on a certain day of the week, the whole unit from the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew gymnasium</span> would march off to the agricultural, I don't know what you would want to call it, <span class="BUILDING">professional school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span> and work there with manure and things like that, help the kids who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and with the dirty work.</sentence><sentence id="412">And my father managed to get me out of that.</sentence><sentence id="413">He managed to switch my urine with a patients urine and, or give me the patients urine and I poured it into the test tube and submitted it as my own and they saw that I had kidney disease and so I managed to stay out of that <span class="BUILDING">paramilitary work unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">But that was how it affected me personally, so I got out of that and my classmates did not appreciate that, my Jewish classmates, it's a funny thing it was, let's say my, not my first experience, but one of my many experiences with Jews against Jews, the total, the animosity between, among Jews, the hostility for different things, one reason or another.</sentence><sentence id="415">I think the first hostility I ran into was when I went to, during that first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went during the Hungarian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="416">Why the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span>, not too far, couple of blocks from where I lived, it was a very old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and most of the students were poor Jewish kids and they hated me from the word go because I was middle class and they were lower class and as I found out later on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was no bigger hatred than a poor Jew had towards a Jew who was not poor.</sentence><sentence id="417">So these kids used to tell me things like, "geh in d'r'erd arine", which I couldn't quite understand and I did not have that good a communication with either my father or my mother, but I had excellent lines of communication with my grandmother and my grandmother knew Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="418">So did my father, so did my mother.</sentence><sentence id="419">I took it to my grandmother, grandmother, what does this mean?</sentence><sentence id="420">She said, drop dead or you should be buried or something, well, literally.</sentence><sentence id="421">So she says, tell them this, next time they tell you that, tell them this, so I went back and I told 6 them that and they were surprised, where did you get that?</sentence><sentence id="422">So after that I was a little bit more accepted, since I could talk back to them, it lent a certain kind of a recognition or something, I don't know what you want to call it, I was on their level now.</sentence><sentence id="423">So I am, getting back now to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, it was again a completely different ball game, for one thing, during the Hungarians, the word Jew was a derogatory word, I mean, I learned, that was a new thing to me, any one of my classmates, there was only one classmate who used to come by and he was the number one or the number two student in the class, real strong too.</sentence><sentence id="424">He never laid a hand on me, he never hit me or anything, but any time he went by me he said Zido(Ph), Jew and he could have said, what the Hungarians would say, like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> then in the south they never say Yankees, they always say damn Yankees, so in Hungarian it was never zido, it was always bido Zido, stinking Jew, stinking Jew and always when I heard that, it's, for a time, eleven, twelve year old, it's I don't know, you hear it all the time and still it irks and it's not something you get used to and it still, you don't build up a thick skin to it and it just, so that's how it affected me personally and when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew high school</span> there was no more of it, nobody could call me Zido because everybody was Zido 02:15 there, everybody was Jewish, but again there was this, there were fellows from different socio-economic levels and there was friction, there was much friction, there was much hostility and there was no, no solidarity, no cohesion, no, there was never among Jews, it's really sad, it's really, they're always, two poor Jews have a stronger bond than just Jew and Jew.</sentence><sentence id="425">I mean it was always mattered to them, let's say you are from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and this fellow is from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> so we have something in common and already we have more in common with, we have common with each other was we have nothing in common with that kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mukachevo</span>, was called Munkacz_ during the Hungarian (occupation), so I lived in a weird world.</sentence><sentence id="426">I can't say at this point it was schizoid, it was schizoid before, it was just weird.</sentence><sentence id="427">And my father got drafted into the <span class="BUILDING">labor unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">First of all he was in the Austro-Hungarian army, he was a lieutenant in the medical service, as a kid fresh out of, after one year of <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> that had rank of an officer.</sentence><sentence id="429">When the Czechs mobilized they made him a private because he was a lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army.</sentence><sentence id="430">So I thought now we are in Hungarian and he used to be a lieutenant, so he'll be a lieutenant again.</sentence><sentence id="431">No, (he was) not recognized, so eventually no Jew was any more recognized anyway, so he was drafted in the labor unit and somehow he managed to get into a labor unit which had a commander with whom he managed to get along all right, so he didn't have to work there.</sentence><sentence id="432">And the other ones who were there had to work and there was not a good unit, but somehow he managed to get along there and eventually he got discharged and then got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but during that time we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without him and again jumping things, my father, after awhile, found it, no more practicing secretly, he was, he tried to get a front man to work with, another doctor with whom he could, to whom he could take the patients across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and sort of share and split the fee or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="433">And through that doctor we met other people and we had, it improved our social life.</sentence><sentence id="434">So that's just an aside, as far as that goes, was a minor improvement in my existence, 7 because I was among more people now and again my father was a living terror with us and it was...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: He was extremely hard, he was, for things which he considered, I don't know, too many things were punishable in his mind and other things for which I expected to be punished I was not punished.</sentence><sentence id="482">So if there was disorder in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, which seems to be my nature, I got a horrible beating.</sentence><sentence id="483">If I was raising <span class="NPIP">hell</span> with my younger brother, we were arguing or fighting and screaming and yelling, that was enough reason for him to fly out of his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, which was inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a belt, a heavy belt in his hand and just hit wherever, first, last, without looking, just as long as he hit body.</sentence><sentence id="484">And schoolwork.</sentence><sentence id="485">I was lazy, I could study, but I didn't like to study.</sentence><sentence id="486">Sometimes he used to say, are you prepared, are you prepared for the lesson, you have the lesson, you studied?</sentence><sentence id="487">Are you ready to recite it?</sentence><sentence id="488">Because in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was always recitation, written exams were given like maybe just four times a year or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="489">All right, come into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and give me the, recite this assignment and turned out I didn't know nothing, I didn't, I just wasn't prepared, I was hoping to bluff my way through it or something and so I got horrible beatings, but I got beatings already as a kid, on one occasion we carried on, we raised <span class="NPIP">hell</span> or something and it ended up both of us were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> after we got such a beating and so as I said, when he was under more pressure himself, passed it on, we got more beatings.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Word of mouth.</sentence><sentence id="577">It's just absurd, I mean everything is absurd, I mean, that's my favorite word, my whole life and everything and it's just, so we had one more conference with Grandmother, Grandmother is going to move in with some cousins, or with someone, a sister and we would be moving in with the people across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and get our things together, a handful of clothing or something like that and next morning, banging on our <span class="DLF">doors</span>, like at seven in the morning are Hungarian police.</sentence><sentence id="578">By this time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was full of recruit police, in other words, police trainees, not the regular ones who were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whom just about everybody knew, these were new police and different, in gray uniforms where the regular police had black ones, these were new ones and they were all rabid, they were all trained to hate and beat and kill Jews.</sentence><sentence id="579">I mean it was, you will now be hearing this until it's in your blood, so it got into their blood and so there was one of these and a detective, I mean what they call a plain clothes police.</sentence><sentence id="580">And he says, you're Havas?Your whole family come along.</sentence><sentence id="581">Says where, what?</sentence><sentence id="582">Don't ask questions, come along.</sentence><sentence id="583">Says, take a couple of things with you and come on along.</sentence><sentence id="584">Said well, my father tried to gain time, which was pointless.</sentence><sentence id="585">He says, well, they took the thing over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or things.</sentence><sentence id="586">Who told you to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, to take your things to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="587">So we gained something like five minutes, he says we will be back in five minutes, you better be ready and ready or not your coming.</sentence><sentence id="588">And at that time, in one of these empty <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, which we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, we had an officer quartered, a Hungarian lieutenant colonel, who was a staff officer and my mother started banging on his <span class="DLF">door</span> and sir, where are they taking us, what are they going to do to us, what?</sentence><sentence id="589">So the colonel comes out looking like he's all sleepy, which he wasn't, because he got up earlier than that usually.</sentence><sentence id="590">Says, oh I really don't know, I really don't know about anything.</sentence><sentence id="591">There was some talk about something at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> yesterday, but I don't know really, anything.</sentence><sentence id="592">So we got out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> already with the police with the rifle and the detective and other people are being lined up and they are marching us and more people from an other <span class="DLF">street</span>, a side <span class="DLF">street</span>, an villagesother.</sentence><sentence id="593">And they are marching us to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>, the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> inside the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and sit down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> or the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> or dirt and they're bringing in more people and nobody knows anything, nobody knows where they taking us or what and wait there and wait there and wait there and a locked in <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you couldn't get out of it, even if there were no guards and it was mid-afternoon or something like that, I'm not exactly sure of the time any more of that, it was a horrible day and there would be many more like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

two <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, one at one outside, they were both way out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span>, well not, there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span>, but then, outside the city limit, outside the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="625">And people from all the

<span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and us special cases are being brought there to and again you didn't know why you were being punished or what and they confiscated lumber from a <span class="DLF">Jewish lumber yard</span> and they are building a three meter high <span class="DLF">fence</span> all around the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and the only one there who was, I don't know what, how to, what label to stick on him, anyway, he was an official of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, a clerk, a manager and he, the Germans came in on him and the

out.</sentence><sentence id="626">You are out of here by this evening and he said, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">file cabinet</span>, 40 or 50 years of operation of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and where am I going to put it?</sentence><sentence id="627">He said, out.</sentence><sentence id="628">So we ran into him and he knew my father or he knew this and he knew that and he was nice to us and he put us up into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> which I don't know what used to be there before, but there are no <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and bricks and clay and dust and he found us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was just off one of the kilns and he says, I'll get you some hay, which was better than straw and you can have this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> as a separate and the villagers will be lying in the <span class="BUILDING">kilns</span>, no <span class="DLF">windows</span>, no nothing, just horrible and nothing and my father says, I'd like to get the kids out of here, I'd like to get the kids out.</sentence><sentence id="629">Suddenly you know, it's again these inconsistencies that he would give his life for the family, but while the family was still his family, he didn't know how to handle them, I mean, he was beating us but now suddenly he would give his life to save the kids.</sentence><sentence id="630">Couldn't save his wife because they knew about her, same way they knew about us, there was no way out.</sentence><sentence id="631">So we should be smuggled out of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and we should be smuggled to someone with patients in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, somebody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, but this is where is comes in, which people always ask, why didn't you hide, why didn't you run away, why didn't you go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, why didn't you go into the forest?There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="632">I had, I was a city boy, I would have been recognized as a city 2 boy, I looked different than the village boys, you could put me into their same clothes, what the

told you I was recognized when I broke the <span class="DLF">window</span>, I was known and I would have been recognized and if somebody would have been willing to take us one month before, as soon as

get us out?</sentence><sentence id="705">And this point I hated him like I have never hated anybody probably and I was just nagging him and he was nagging us, he nagged, when he couldn't beat, when he decided that I was too old to be beaten, he used psychological terror on me and he continued to do that even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">brick

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: At the end of the last tape, you started to describe to me the fact that you and your family were taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and driven to the other, the second <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting, you could see that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting, but before you tell me what happened with your father, mother and brother, tell me what you knew at that time about the fate of other Jews that had been either from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or in the <span class="REGION">region</span>, so what could you imagine might be awaiting you at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="811">03:02:</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="812">A: Hungarian troops were fighting on what was called the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and so were Jewish labor units were assigned to that front and they were being used there to dig up <span class="DLF">mines</span> planted by the Russians or dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> or any kind of work and sometimes the Hungarian troops used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on sick leave or something like that and they talked and they told us things which were going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, mainly in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> because that's where these troops were.</sentence><sentence id="813">And there were people sometimes coming over from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into our <span class="REGION">area</span>, civilians and they talked and they told us, again, they told somebody and word got around and these were people whom you could trust, in other words, these were, we knew that these were fact, that these things were true.</sentence><sentence id="814">They told us that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the Jews were massacred in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, that they were dumped into <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> and that the earth was moving on top of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> for weeks after the shootings, after the killings, that not all of them were completely killed and the ones who came back from the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>, they apparently must have met Einsatztruppen or saw them in action, they said the Jews were taken out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a <span class="DLF">field</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they were rounded up and all of them were brought together and they were surrounded and then the Germans mounted the machine gun on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they were circling around these surrounded people and they were machine- gunning them and as long as they kept on circling them and firing into them until they assumed that everybody was killed.</sentence><sentence id="815">So we knew about this.</sentence><sentence id="816">Then, one of the things which the Hungarians started early, was this stuff about citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="817">And that was, in all case, we had to get the papers so we could get passports, and we were trying to get passports so we could come, even still in 1940 we were trying to get somehow to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="818">It was war was in Europe, but <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not yet at war.</sentence><sentence id="819">So we were rounding up our ancestors papers, birth certificates of great-grandparents and going back to the middle of the 19th century or early 19th century so we could prove that we lived, 03:05: our ancestors lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, that we did not infiltrate from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, that we were local Jews and we got Hungarian citizenship, we got passports, but they got us nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="820">But there were other Jews who did come in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, probably, I'm not sure how it was, but I'll presume that during the Austro-Hungarian empire, at which time <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> was part of the empire, there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it was partitioned, people from there, probably for to improve their lot economically or somehow, moved from <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span> or maybe even into 8 <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> proper and naturally these people could not prove their citizenship and the Hungarians knew who they were, they always knew who it was, who, I didn't mention to you that already at age 12, the same as I had to belong to the Leventers(ph), I had to have an ID card and since I was Jewish, on it was in red letter Z, for Zido, so they had track of everybody and they knew who these people were who didn't have citizenship and one day, again backtracking, the war broke out in 1941 with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and Soviet Union and the Hungarians, which were closely tied to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the military especially, the officers and higher ranks, the staff, they were all completely pro-German.</sentence><sentence id="821">They found an excuse, they created an excuse, it was a phony bombing raid on Kosice, which was carried out by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and they said that it was bombed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet planes</span> and immediately <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> declared war on the Soviet Union and attacked.</sentence><sentence id="822">And Hungarian army units, let's say an entire army was assigned to move in to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>.</sentence><sentence id="823">So once <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> was attacked, vast <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> became <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span>, where nobody counted for anything, I mean they could murder Russian civilians, Ukranian civilians and was the start of the extermination of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="824">It was, while they were reluctant to do something like that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> proper, didn't want to have the German people see things like that, once they were in the Soviet Union, there were no more holds, no holds barred and there were just, they had complete freedom to murder and do anything they wanted and in any way the wanted, and that's how these so-called Polish Jews who were in our <span class="REGION">area</span> were loaded up onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> and shipped into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and eventually word got back that they were all murdered.</sentence><sentence id="825">Years after the war, when I started doing research, I found where they were murdered and how and what and it was a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenetz Podolsk</span>, the Kamenetz Podolsk massacre.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: No, but I know from people.</sentence><sentence id="874">I'm giving you second hand information, but it's reliable.</sentence><sentence id="875">I wouldn't repeat it if it wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="876">And girls from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were, one ought to have his hat off to them, they were running all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trying to get food together and they cooked soups for these people, like from beans and whatever they could get together and people were torn because it was a holiday and it was not a day to cook food, but some nevertheless relented and these girls did everything possible and they took it out in cans and pitchers and whatever and the guards wouldn't let it on, the guards wouldn't let them give it to the people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, they wouldn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span>, they wouldn't let them give water, they wouldn't anything.</sentence><sentence id="877">And there was, all you had to do was say <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we knew what it meant, I mean to us it meant extermination of Jews en masse.</sentence><sentence id="878">I mean, mass extermination and we knew that somewhere something was going on, I mean we knew about the shootings in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, we knew about the shootings in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and I should mention this one, in "43 a Slovak boy appeared in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a young boy about barely 12 at that time, I was 14 and rumor had it that he was rescued from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, that he was taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, with the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, with all the people, together with his family and everything and the way the story was that the Germans tied them together by fours and they fired one shot through the four bodies.</sentence><sentence id="879">And the kid was shorter than the ones in front of them and the bullet went over his head or grazed his head and they all keeled over and they brought in some <span class="BUILDING">burial units</span> to bury them and the kid was the only one alive in that whole people, the whole group(?)_</sentence><sentence id="880">were murdered.</sentence><sentence id="881">And somehow Hungarian soldiers or Jewish labor units hid him and somehow they found 0 out that he had a grandmother or a grand-aunt living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span>_ and they smuggled him into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the 03:17 Hungarians found out about it and somehow they didn't extradite him and they didn't arrest him and they let him stay there and I heard this and I was a very nosy or curious kid and I used to walk all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, one of the things my father insisted on, I should go on walks to get exercise, to be on fresh air, so I knew the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, every <span class="DLF">street</span>, every <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, every <span class="REGION">section</span> and I knew where the kid was, so that day I went walking to the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the kid was and I was trying to get a glimpse of him, even behind his <span class="DLF">fence</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> which you couldn't see through it, somehow and I kept loitering there until I got a glimpse of him that I could say that I saw the kid.</sentence><sentence id="882">When were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, the kid was arrested and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, he didn't go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the grandmother, he was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and just saying this doesn't illustrate anything, point, but I don't know what happened to him after that.</sentence><sentence id="883">So getting back to, the two <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> were called, one was belonged to the Kaloush(ph), a person named Kaloush(ph) and the other one belonged to his father-in-law named Shyowitz(ph), so we were originally in the <span class="BUILDING">Kaloush(ph) factory</span>, which was at one end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were taken to the Shyowitz(ph), from where there were, that Hungarian police captain handed us over to this police officer, the Hungarian told him to give us a going over, for which purpose he had a, favorite beating instrument in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is a bull's penis, which is, which they dry out and it cannot be broken, in other words they can beat and beat and beat a person with it and it will not split like a piece of wood or a stick and that was their favorite, so this one had one of those and he started beating us, for any odd way and we were standing there and like 20 feet from us was the <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> and we knew that we were going to be loaded on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> and probably to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and probably shot and massacred or something.</sentence><sentence id="884">But there were all these rumors, there were all these rumors circulating and spread deliberately that the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> would be taken to <span class="COUNTRY">inside Hungary</span> for labor.</sentence><sentence id="885">But nobody knew where, or what.</sentence><sentence id="886">So 03:20 we were being beaten there and beaten and then SS, who were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the whole <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> was supervised by maybe four SS.</sentence><sentence id="887">They were able to handle 4,000 prisoners and one of them came by and gave my father a beating and he had a walking stick, which was diameter this thick and he just used that for beating.</sentence><sentence id="888">And we were already waiting to get away from all this beating and be put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">And finally the hour came and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then of course they locked the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, it was one of these <span class="DLF">rolling gates</span> and I don't know how much time went by there and they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and they shove in an old, white haired woman.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: Nobody.</sentence><sentence id="914">Was an empty, the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was empty and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in which, I assume the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was empty and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in which we were was empty and I was trying to count the number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but I couldn't because after awhile they all merge into each other and you wouldn't believe who this old woman was, she was Vazari's(ph) Jewish mother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="915">I mean the fate, there is my father, persecuted and ruined and my whole life ruined, my life ruined, his life and everything by Vazari(ph) and who sits down next to us, his mother-in-law.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="919">Q: You knew her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="921">A: My mother knew her, I did not know her and she said, Wazari(ph) is my son-in-law, he will get me out.</sentence><sentence id="922">So we sit there and we sit there in the dark and warmth and it was a sunny day and the sun burning on this locked up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and then late afternoon, noise <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, screaming, yelling, shouting and you could hear beating and they open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they put a <span class="DLF">ramp</span> through it and people are running in, mobs and running and pushed in, I mean they are beating the ones behind who are pushing the ones in front and the man is yelling, but there are people here already, we're supposed to be 80 in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and three others came in addition, because they wanted to be with us because of families and there are already five people here, we are 88.</sentence><sentence id="923">Shut up.</sentence><sentence id="924">And they told him, you are in charge and you make sure that nobody escapes and everybody gets to their <span class="NPIP">destination</span> all right.</sentence><sentence id="925">So he said, I'm in charge and he accepted that and he thought he was in charge.</sentence><sentence id="926">So when it started getting dark somebody came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> and we are just sitting there all crowded up, 88 of us in this small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span>, I mean it was not meant to hold 88 people or 80 or 8, it was, during World War 1, they used those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> to carry 40 soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="927">At that time it was 40 soldiers or eight horses.</sentence><sentence id="928">Now it was like the Germans could shove in like anything from 80 to 100 Jews into one of those, half suffocated them or what, didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="929">So, and there was one 03:24: other clue.</sentence><sentence id="930">My father was frisked before he was taken from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Kaloush</span> to the Shyowitz and they gave him a beating there and they took away his watch and he was protesting that he has need the watch to take pulse of, he's a doctor and he need it for that.</sentence><sentence id="931">He says to him, where you going, you won't be needing that watch.</sentence><sentence id="932">So again, indecipherable clues and then somebody came by after it got dark and got to the, where there was a little <span class="DLF">gap</span> in the <span class="DLF">door</span> that's gaped and he said, are the Havas's in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>?</sentence><sentence id="933">He says, yes.</sentence><sentence id="934">Says I saw you when you were brought in, do you need anything?</sentence><sentence id="935">Because we were just like they grabbed us off the <span class="DLF">street</span> or out of anywhere, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="936">So we whispered to him, can you get us a coat or two, extra coats or something and most important for my father, toothbrushes, toothbrushes and toothpaste and there was one other thing.</sentence><sentence id="937">My father had one sensible idea when we were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were going to kill all of us, the morphine.</sentence><sentence id="938">He got together what he considered would be a lethal dose for the four of us and injections and he kept it in a steel case in which doctors usually keep instruments and stuff like that, but he kept postponing it, kept postponing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: You knew this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="962">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="964">Q: Did he tell you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="966">A: Yeah, we were all in on it and we all had to agree to it and when they were taking us away, when we didn't know where on April 19th, when we were being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> but we didn't know where, I said make sure you get the morphine, make sure you take it with us.</sentence><sentence id="967">So he grabbed that box with all the stuff in it and then of course we got separated from it, because they grabbed him from the <span class="BUILDING">Kaloush factory</span> and they frisked him and beat him up and they put him in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with the police captain, that was the end of the morphine, so I said, we said to him, get them from the <span class="BUILDING">medic station</span> to get your morphine.</sentence><sentence id="968">So they did not know what it was for, they figure it was for pain killing and they brought a cassette for injections, I mean syringes and morphine ampules and said how much did you get, he said, not enough even for one person, to kill one person.</sentence><sentence id="969">So, that was that.</sentence><sentence id="970">And so and this guy did bring us and when we asked for something else he said, wait until it gets darker because I'm afraid to come by and I'll get caught, I'll be badly, I'll get it badly.</sentence><sentence id="971">So then he brought one thing at one time and another thing at another time, I mean that's what we had and it was all and two of the things he brought us from somebody, he got two raincoats, which were light, lightweight, what we used to call balloon coats and that's how I recognized myself on that picture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, in that raincoat and it's light, it's like off-white, or beige color and it sticks out among all those other people who are in black or dark clothes.</sentence><sentence id="972">And so we are all in this thing, in this shut-up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and now we are waiting, when is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to be starting to pull out and sometime during the night, it started to pull out and then watch which way is it going.</sentence><sentence id="973">We knew all the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we watched and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> to a <span class="DLF">railroad junction</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">I think it was Chop.</sentence><sentence id="975">So we knew that we couldn't go, we could be heading anywhere from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chopt</span> because it was a junction point, but we knew by then that we were not going north, directly to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the killings took place, so next thing we see was somebody, a crack in the <span class="DLF">door</span> where it's not closed completely, you could see that name, I think it may have been Kosice which is_ to the west.</sentence><sentence id="976">The next thing we know, we're in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, which is odd, because all the Slovakian Jews were taken away already, why would they take the Hungarian Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>?</sentence><sentence id="977">And then people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, putting their heads together, or quote unquote heads, nobody had a head and at this point in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and the SS came in and the SS took over the guarding of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, so I presume that, although we didn't see them, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> up to that point was guarded either by Hungarian armed gendarmes or Hungarian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="978">And at that point, this is unbelievable, the SS permitted, opened all the <span class="DLF">gates</span> on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and it said, from each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> one person out with a bucket for water.</sentence><sentence id="979">And then they did it again, it was a <span class="DLF">line</span>-up, it was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> with a pump and they could pump just so much and maybe four or five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> got water, all right, that's it, everybody back in, up, up, get into your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and <span class="DLF">gates</span> being shut and locked up and off we go.</sentence><sentence id="980">And then we were watching, which way now, which way now and this was already <span class="REGION">foreign territory</span>, we did not know the names of 3 the 03:31 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">And then we keep on watching and the we're in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, crossing from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we recognized some Polish names, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span>, but now knowing whereabouts it is and then we started saying, now are we going to go east to the <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> or west?</sentence><sentence id="982">So we keep on watching, and these are foreign <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, but we later, one way or another, by the lay of the sun or what, we figured out we are going west.</sentence><sentence id="983">The relief, I mean they are not taking us to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> where they are shooting them and burying them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">And we left on Monday the 15th and during the night on the 15th and it had to be on the 17th, we arrive at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in the middle of the night and from the cracks we could see out, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, which was in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">So it was, why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>?</sentence><sentence id="986">We did not know anything, we had no idea what was going on or where or why and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stands there and then it's being shuttled from one <span class="DLF">track</span> to another <span class="DLF">track</span>, to another <span class="DLF">track</span>, to another <span class="DLF">track</span> and shuttled back and what was front is now moving back.</sentence><sentence id="987">In the morning we end up someplace and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops and there's no more movement and I should add this, that the ride and the thirst, without water, the crowding, the people crowded together, squeezed together, you couldn't lie down, you could only sit on your haunches and people more or less urinating in front of each other, defecating in front of each other, the smell, horrible feeling, it just, kids crying and little ones and I was in the middle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with a woman, I don't know maybe in the forties and she didn't have a nose, just horrible looking.</sentence><sentence id="988">I asked my father what it was, he said she had TB of the nose.</sentence><sentence id="989">A horrible sight.</sentence><sentence id="990">So we are at the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, at an unknown <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is stopped there and there's no more movement and we don't know where we are and then the sun is coming up and daylight and the <span class="DLF">train gates</span> are being opened.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1138">Q: But ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: Mm-hm, we didn't know it was a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>_ but somehow, at some point, somebody said to us what's happened.</sentence><sentence id="1141">The ones at the <span class="BUILDING">arrival place</span> were risking their life for every word they told us and for me this was not completely new.</sentence><sentence id="1142">On one of those broadcasts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, they were talking about civilian laborers who went to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and the Germans used them until they were 03:46 completely used up, totally worn out from the hard work and they told them that they are going to send them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for recreation and they took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, looked like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and once they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, they dropped the gas bomb in and they killed them all and then they burnt them.</sentence><sentence id="1143">So, in other words, this was not completely new.</sentence><sentence id="1144">On one of those broadcasts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, they were talking about civilian laborers who went to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and the Germans used them until they were completely used up, totally worn out from the hard work and they told them that they are going to send them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for recreation and they took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, looked like a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and once they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, they dropped the gas bomb in and they killed them all and then they burnt them.</sentence><sentence id="1145">So, in other words, I heard this from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, but the scenario was different, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was different and as I found out, as we knew, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was lying on many occasions and they were trying to discourage Hungarian Christians from going to work as volunteers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, for labor.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And so, once somebody mentioned <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, I knew the whole story, I mean I knew where, what it's about and then we were standing in this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and just standing there naked and standing and standing and waiting and then come in two prisoners with numbers tattoos on their forearms.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1155">Q: Some prisoners came in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1157">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="1158">And they set up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">portable table</span> and they have cards and they start taking our names and filling out the name, date of birth and by then we already were programmed that, I was born in "28, not "29 and Robbie was born in "30 and not "31.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I just didn't have the nerve to lie more than one year.</sentence><sentence id="1160">And so we start asking them questions, we were bombarding them, they were the first humans <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, I said, so what happened to the whole people, what happened to the family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1165">Q: ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1167">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1168">See those flames there"?</sentence><sentence id="1169">Flames going up there now?</sentence><sentence id="1170">That's where they are, they're going up.</sentence><sentence id="1171">And people from let's say my outfit or my trainload, they just wouldn't, couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1172">So, and I says to them, what about these numbers, everybody gets numbers, when are we going to get numbers?</sentence><sentence id="1173">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And these were the clerks.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And most of their answers were like either I don't know or an equivalent I don't care.</sentence><sentence id="1176">Then, where are you 7 from?</sentence><sentence id="1177">They said they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">How long you been here?</sentence><sentence id="1179">I don't know, a year or two years, whatever they say, but we got very little intelligence from them and what we did get, they wouldn't believe, they didn't want to believe.</sentence><sentence id="1180">So, eventually they let us keep our shoes and they let us keep belts, belts or suspenders and they eventually sent us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, which was a real <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and gave us prison clothes, rags for shorts and rags for shirts and marched us into one of those <span class="BUILDING">storage buildings</span>, couldn't call them <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, they didn't have any <span class="DLF">windows</span>, no nothing, they were like storage and in it there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">storage bins</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1181">So there were three stories, into each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bin</span>, 10 people, 10 prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1182">Oh and they cut us, our hair, the grownups they were shaved the chest, they shaved the back, they shaved the pubic areas or clipped them.</sentence><sentence id="1183">So there we were and put up or go to sleep there and every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> got thrown or bin got thrown a blanket.</sentence><sentence id="1184">The next morning the head counts and formation and all day and standing there all day, and first contact with other prisoners, come in a bunch of young, well dressed, Polish prisoners, with the armband, black armband with the white letters or white armband with black letters saying Kapo and weird people and to me at 15, the whole thing looked absurd, I mean here was a man who, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, who I got frisked of everything, I could keep my suspenders and my shoes and here he had quite a large, a chronometer, which I only saw in a <span class="DLF">jewelers shop window</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I've never seen a watch like that on a person in civilian ever in all my days.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And here he was sporting one of those things.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And his prison uniform, I could tell, I mean to me I could tell, was custom made.</sentence><sentence id="1188">A lousy, God damn striped uniform, but tailored to his shape, to his body.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And since he couldn't have a white shirt, nobody could have a white shirt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, he had a white bib under the striped jacket so it looked like he had a white shirt on.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I mean, the mentality of these people and there were like three or four of these and they were Polish, we asked them what they were and they were Poles and they were Christians and they were coming with shoes and a loaf of bread because they were looking at our shoes, if they were any good, says, I trade you these and a loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1191">In other words they were looting us while we were still alive and our, maybe 10 years ago I got hold of a book called Fighting Auschwitz, which was written by, I think Arlinski(ph), a Polish man, maybe he was there himself and he was just going on and on and on about resistance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and underground and resistance and how they were connected and how everything was and how they were involved in everything.</sentence><sentence id="1192">So when I saw this I says to myself, oh we were not visited by Kapo, we were contacted by the resistance, by the camp resistance, these were not Polish robbers, they were Polish resistance people.</sentence><sentence id="1193">So I just, there was a scene which I won't forget ever and which I'll hold against the good old Polacks forever and they managed to get some shoes, so again, being a wise guy I asked the guy, young fellow, why did you give him your shoes, were you that hungry, were you that much in need of that loaf of bread?</sentence><sentence id="1194">Is that going to make a difference to you?</sentence><sentence id="1195">Says, well they told us that they was going to take it away anyway, they're going to take away our shoes anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1196">So most of us told him then, gave him the answer, he says, will they take it away?</sentence><sentence id="1197">Until they take it away, I'll have it.</sentence><sentence id="1198">I'm not trading with you.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And they were asking us for news from the outside world and we told them they took away our radios a month and a half ago and we didn't know anything what's going on and until then what we knew, the news was not that great.</sentence><sentence id="1200">The Soviets, the Red Armny is just barely touching <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, they're nowhere anywhere near.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1202">So and we were in formation there all day, just standing there and standing there and standing 8 there.</sentence><sentence id="1203">There were space between the, these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> or <span class="BUILDING">sheds</span> or <span class="BUILDING">storage buildings</span> and in the morning they counted us, an SS counted us and in the evening they counted us.</sentence><sentence id="1204">Now it was very important how many there are.</sentence><sentence id="1205">By the way, it didn't matter to anybody if there were 88 of us in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> when we arrived and I just couldn't understand them because it was so important that 88 people should be in it, that nobody should escape and here it didn't matter any more, no not at all.</sentence><sentence id="1206">It was just one absurd thing after another, it was like a world completely topsy-turvy, it was just.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And when we were standing there naked, waiting to be processed or whatever, the women run by naked, screaming.</sentence><sentence id="1208">The same, our women who got separated from us and who didn't have children and who were selected for labor, but my mother told me many a year later, she says, I saw you, but I was naked and you were naked so I wouldn't say anything, _-?_-- or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And then eventually an SS who was processing them and who was chasing them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, he pulled down the <span class="DLF">curtains</span> for them so they wouldn't have to be there, exposed, naked.</sentence><sentence id="1210">Which again, so unlike an SS, that he had some consideration.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1291">A: We arrived there on Thursday, the 18th and we stayed there until Friday, which was the 26th, I believe and during that time we were like, my brother and me among total strangers or since, I didn't mention before that by being rushed to this Shyowitz(ph) <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, I got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was like 99 percent people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were brought in, so I did not know anybody there and they didn't know me.</sentence><sentence id="1292">There were very few people actually from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> itself on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1293">So, as my father's group got moved out, others moved in, then somebody else got again moved out, so it was rotation and mixing and all that and then on Friday they emptied our entire <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they marched us to the same <span class="DLF">railroad platform</span> or <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where we were unloaded except now we were on the other side of it, there were three <span class="DLF">tracks</span> there and we came in on the, facing outward on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and now we were lining up on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> and in front of us was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and again we were just standing in front of them and this time they were counting 50 of us in prison uniforms into each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they gave us bread and water for the trip and the guards this time were soldiers like I've never seen before either in life or in pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1294">They were what the Germans call Marine Soldaten, in other words like marine soldiers, but they were older and we were very glad that they were not SS because we just feared the SS very much, we knew them from reputation, what they were.</sentence><sentence id="1295">And we saw them, what they did in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> too, it was real bad.</sentence><sentence id="1296">So anyway, you think that getting into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> only 50 of us would be a little more spacious, whereas compared to 88, but it wasn't, because the guards decided to divide, well they didn't decide it, but it worked out that that was the arrangement, the guards were in the middle, they had one-third of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to the two guards and one third to 25 prisoners and the other third to 25 prisoners, so you can figure out the, and we were sitting again, all pulled up on our haunches and as it was getting dark at night, we started finally inching out our legs to see if the guards will react or if they're going to let us stretch out a little bit and they did let us stretch out and as soon as it was daylight, started yelling and, get back, get back and so we had to pull back and again crowd into each other's stomachs and against each other and just sit there and sit and sit and on late Saturday night, somewhere on Saturday, we arrived again 04:05 someplace and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and next morning they opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and now SS men, wild looking SS get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, the Marine Soldaten are going away and these are young, vicious looking ones, with submachine guns on the shoulder, not rifles like the Marine Soldaten had, these are armed for close shooting and making a massacre of anything if there's any trouble and I knew what those kind of weapons were, that's all, maybe somebody else didn't, but I knew what they could do.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And eventually they unload us, everybody out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and then I see on the <span class="BUILDING">stationhouse</span> there's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1298">Again I use some mmemonic device to memorize that name.</sentence><sentence id="1299">It was seed distributor in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and it was called Mautner and everybody knew the Mautner seeds and they were in existence for 1 generations, so Maut and hausen like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muenchhausen</span> or something, so could remember that name.</sentence><sentence id="1300">And then they started marching us and it's a long march on pebbly <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="DLF">secondary roads</span> and first through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then through a <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and <span class="DLF">roads</span> and turned out that, I found this out already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that my brother had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the sole of his shoe and while we were waiting to be loaded onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I saw piles of empty cartons or cases from lamps, light bulbs, which, they were always changing the light bulbs in the <span class="DLF">electric fence</span>, the lighting so nothing would ever burn out or get disconnected or something, but and there were piles of these so I put some of those in my pocket for future use and to put my margarine into it and so I stuffed several of those into my brother's shoe so there would be something between the pebbles of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the sharp stones and his feet, but it didn't help much and he was just in pain and crying and he was hot, it was warm, very bright sun and we were thirsty and it was a long march and hard and SS on both sides and yelling.</sentence><sentence id="1301">So finally we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Mauthausen</span>, which was a very, I don't know, forbidding looking <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the whole, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> again, they're not temporary, they were made, built from granite stone and they were like maybe two and a half meters high or three meters high and on the top of the <span class="DLF">stone fence</span> there were strips of barb wire again, like maybe five strips and again with the insulators to let you know that they were electrified and it took the better part of a day to get processed there and again somebody came, a German prisoner and picked out the younger ones and you go, you stay over here and among those was my brother and I tried to yank him back to the group where I was and the guy spotted it and he pulled him out again.</sentence><sentence id="1302">And then I tried to go, I tried to sneak into that group and he spotted me and pulled me back and I tried one more time and he said, you try it one more time and you'll get it.</sentence><sentence id="1303">So that was the last time I saw my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And the other thing I was curious about, they were doing <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, we were taking into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, which was underground at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">stone building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1305">I was very curious to see if anybody's coming out of those <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> or if those are the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> type showers.</sentence><sentence id="1306">And I didn't want to go in, I was waiting, again it was odd that they should have taken us that far by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> just to kill us now, but at this point there were so many inconsistencies and so many irrational, one thing after another, that I wasn't sure any more about anything and when I saw them coming out I went in and then the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> could hold, I guess maybe 25-30 people, it was not a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> like some <span class="NPIP">places</span>, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had for example, or some others.</sentence><sentence id="1307">And they were yelling and somehow I managed to stay through two or three showerings, you know, was new groups came in and others went out and I was mixed in with the rest and I enjoyed the hot water and when I came out, our shoes were gone.</sentence><sentence id="1308">They were good shoes, so a fellow, brother Jew stole them and left in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> their worn out, horrible pair.</sentence><sentence id="1309">Made a good deal.</sentence><sentence id="1310">And then some of us were taken together and marched into a separate <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, which was separated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> again by this very high <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> and the barbed wire on top of it and we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we were sleeping on maybe straw sacks on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they were lining us up like sardines, head to foot, head to foot and squeezing, there were 500 of us.</sentence><sentence id="1311">And we were in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a whole week, or let's say from Sunday until Friday afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="1312">On Friday afternoon, they marched us 2 to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and loaded us, not into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, but into a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian train</span>, which again, I never met anybody who was taken anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I mean a prisoner, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1313">And this was one of those where every <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> had a <span class="DLF">door</span> opening to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which we are used to in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, had a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> from which the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> opened in to and one SS gets into each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he says, nobody move because I'm going to shoot without warning.</sentence><sentence id="1314">And we're sitting like five across the wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span>, like normal civilians, unbelievable, no crowding, nobody sitting on top of anybody else and you can sit and he said sit at attention and don't try to move, don't talk and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and stayed there in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> for a long time and then got going again and we arrived at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> it said Ebensee(ph), again I never heard of Ebensee(ph) today before, never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="1315">And they unload us, again, new SS get on, pick us up, take over and march us a good distance into, up <span class="DLF">hill</span> into another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1316">We get into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it's like virtually hidden in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1317">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> are surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and there are cut down trees tossed on the tops of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span>, to conceal them further.</sentence><sentence id="1318">And just enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> 4:14 cut down for the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on either side, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> all around and again processing and sorting and you go here and the two men with whom I became friendly or one man with whom I became friendly a Mauthausen, we stayed together somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1319">And he was an attorney in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> and was a very nice person.</sentence><sentence id="1320">And again that was fortunate for me that I met him and that he was that nice.</sentence><sentence id="1321">And after sorting and being checked by an SS doctor, again undressed naked and a floodlight on you to see what shape you are in and he picked out I don't know how many of us and we got assigned to one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1322">We find out when we are there that we are working in <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> on a rotating shift and eight hour shift and our shift happened to start on Sunday night at 11.</sentence><sentence id="1323">So it would be from 11 until 7 in the morning working in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And tunnel work was, we had no idea what it's for or what weird looking thing, a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and into it are cut <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, one after another, like maybe seven or eight <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and they told us, you are working in <span class="DLF">tunnel seven</span>, remember that and the outfit for which you are working is Holtzmann-Polanski(ph) and those same firms are still existing in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1361">Q: , these were tall <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1363">A: Tall <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1365">Q: Large enough to...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1367">A: Hold a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And we go in there and there are scaffoldings inside the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and on the scaffoldings are drills, pneumatic drills with the hammers and power drills, I mean with the brrrrr and compressed air is blowing through the pipes, there is pipes like this in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>, along the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, pumping in <span class="DLF">air</span>, pumping power for the drills and then the drill holes for the dynamite, for blasting and the German civilian sends everybody out from the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and sets up the dynamite and blasts it and then after everything is clear, then he checks the blast and we go back in and pick out the, load all the broken rock onto narrow gauge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and push them out and pick up the rails and extend them further into the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>, deeper and 3 deeper and there's one section of 04:17 the rail which is a switching point where there are two <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and you can switch from one track to another and that weighed a ton, it was steel and it was grabbing all around it and lifting it up and as always in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, nobody was, somebody was always getting out from carrying his load, so the next one carried twice as much.</sentence><sentence id="1369">That was the hardest part in it and the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was cold and damp and the water was coming in between the rocks at some <span class="NPIP">places</span> and it was night and noise and everything.</sentence><sentence id="1370">I worked there for a week and a new transport of Jews came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>) and they got picked through and I got out of that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I got to a day time job and others got assigned to the night time shift.</sentence><sentence id="1371">So another 500 transported, 500.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And so I did all kinds of work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>) and when we come back in the evening from the work, there's a command yelling out, all Jews out, in other words in the evening they used to have head counts and in the morning the head counts and the formations standing and standing until everybody got counted and after everybody was counted then we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and get supper, or a loaf of bread, I mean a section of bread and some margarine or something, whatever came with it, you know, sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And then this time, all Jews out, stay on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you're not going back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and suddenly we are surrounded by what I call the beaters, these were the way some people earn their living by being barbers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or being block chiefs, these are, earn their living by beating other prisoners and turned out that there was a huge pile or several huge piles of pre-fabricated <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> sections and we were supposed to take those sections and carry them on our shoulders to the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where a new <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> would be built.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And these sections weighed a ton and they were beating us with heavy hoses and sticks until we picked it up, like they used to beat horses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacz</span> until they started pulling their load, they beat them.</sentence><sentence id="1375">And again the same thing, the little guy up front made like he's carrying, but he was walking under it, fellow Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1376">And then when we got near his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, he just bolted and dashed away and the rest of us got for sure stuck with a whole section of that thing.</sentence><sentence id="1377">And then some of these sections had <span class="DLF">holes</span> in them for <span class="DLF">windows</span>, so again it was impossible to carry the even load, one <span class="NPIP">section</span> was heavy as a ton and the other ones was just a frame of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and as it turned out, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was supposed, turned out to be later on, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">So just again coincidence and irony or whatever you want to call it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1392">Q: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, was it majority Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: No, that was another thing, let me get to that, we were the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> who were kept for labor, who were not killed within three days.</sentence><sentence id="1395">Up to that point, all Jews who reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> were murdered within three days.</sentence><sentence id="1396">If they were not dead by the third day, the SS started to make jokes at them, he says, you like it here, how come you're still alive, this <span class="NPIP">place</span> agrees with you?</sentence><sentence id="1397">This I only find out later, but anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was full of all kinds of nationalities, there were at that time when we arrived there, maybe 5500, there 4 were Russian POW's, Soviet Red Army POW's, there were Polish civilians, Russian civilians, there were Frenchmen.</sentence><sentence id="1398">There was a handful of Spaniards from the civil war, who the Germans captured somehow, one way or another from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> turned them over to the Germans and there were Italians and there were a handful of Czechs and maybe one or two Greeks and that was it, so we were the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> [not correct] and the first Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>) and getting back to these building sections, when we finally reached the bottom one, under it was snow, in the middle of June.</sentence><sentence id="1399">In other words, these shipments arrived in the winter, Ebensee(ph) was being, they started building it in November "43, we got there on the second of June and these piles of sections, of pre-fabricated sections were there since November or December and the winters were such that there was still snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> across from Ebensee(ph) when we got there and it was not until July or August when it finally melted, so it was a cool <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1400">And one thing I definitely want to mention is the stealing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, stealing of the food by the ones who distributed it and the stealing of the food by fellow prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1401">And I would say the Jews were probably, if not the worst, very close to it as far as stealing.</sentence><sentence id="1402">My bread got stolen many times until (finally ?)</sentence><sentence id="1403">and I cried and some of the other fellows told me, he said look, it's not such a big piece of bread that you couldn't eat it in one sitting, so why don't you eat it in the evening as soon as you get it and that way it will be in your stomach and not in somebody else's.</sentence><sentence id="1404">So I finally learned my lesson, from then on I did it that way, but there again was one so called good advice from my father, always save some for the next day, which in this case, like so many other of his advices turned out to be not quite suitable for the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the time.</sentence><sentence id="1405">It just was not that type of a world and as far as stealing by the chiefs, it was like this, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> they knew for each <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, how many prisoners were in each <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they filled the, I don't know what you want to call it, the containers that, some of them could hold 25 liters, some of them could hold 50 liters and they filled them accordingly so everybody would get one liter of soup and the soup was mostly vegetables, but were vegetables, it's not like green beans and stuff like that, there was turnips beets and related things.</sentence><sentence id="1406">Occasionally you were lucky if you find a small, found a small piece of potato and sometimes, very rarely, you found some piece of meat in there, but very rarely.</sentence><sentence id="1407">And anyway, there was, in addition to the number of liters, they always gave some extra for the chiefs in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, so they would have more food than the peons or ordinary prisoners, but it was not enough for them, the extra what was being shipped to them, they used to, first of all, as soon as the containers arrived, the block chief went in with the ladle and got from the bottom of it, where the good stuff settled and gave one for myself, one for you, one for the clerk and one for the Kapo and one for this and take them <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1408">And then he says, oh here's one more for this one and one more for that one and then he started ladling out and then he stirred it up a little bit, what was left.</sentence><sentence id="1409">So what we were getting was already thinner, because he picked out the best from the bottom and then again, he watched your face and if he liked you, he dipped into the bottom and he gave you that way, if he didn't like you, he just put in from top and you got broth or you got very few floating vegetables or something like that and it was just, every bite meant a lot and you were being robbed by this one, 5 you were being robbed by that one and it was just a very, very bad world and a very bad situation.</sentence><sentence id="1410">And one of the things with the shoe, when I got the bad shoe, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>), we got assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> right away, happened to be a friendly Polish guy there, a young one, who did not have a prison uniform tailored to his body and was just a regular prison jacket, but he had a black cap, which was another sign of rank, which they all loved to wear.</sentence><sentence id="1411">I don't know how they managed to get them, or where they got them, but anybody with any rank has to have a black cap, a black hat with a visor.</sentence><sentence id="1412">So he said, you need shoe, I'll get you a shoe.</sentence><sentence id="1413">So he gave me a wooden shoe, I mean a shoe with a wooden sole and kind of strong, I don't know what you want to call it, plastic material or something on the top and I don't know at which point I got them, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> where I got a pair of foot rags to wear inside the shoes and we all had those in place of socks, nobody had socks, we had rags, you wrapped your feet in rags.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And these shoes which he gave me were lined with felt and I thought the felt would be good enough, I wouldn't have to need the rags and I wore them that way and they started rubbing against my skin and they abraded the skin and it wouldn't heal and it just kept opened and opened and wound and finally found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and I went there and I got it bandaged, the bandage was crepe paper and the cleaning was with peroxide, they just sloshed it with peroxide and I don't know if they put any ointment on it at all but they wrapped it up in the white crepe and that was it, off you go.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And then I found out that if the wound is bad enough that you might get a day off from work, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> rest, they let you stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and I learned all tricks as much as I could, I mean I kept my eyes opened and my ears opened because otherwise my father said I was not survival material and I was trying to, I wasn't trying to prove him wrong, I was just trying to get by.</sentence><sentence id="1416">And find out as many tricks as I could use to get by.</sentence><sentence id="1417">So one day I did get a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> rest and one day while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I see somebody with diarrhea and they shove him a pan and tell him prove it, so he goes in to the pan and fine, you go into the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>, stay here.</sentence><sentence id="1418">So again, it was chance, in some cases, people who had diarrhea were killed, were beaten to death, in some cases they got admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, so it was all kinds of inconsistencies.</sentence><sentence id="1419">Who are you running to, when, what time of the day?</sentence><sentence id="1420">Going on a sick leave, it was a murder, I mean there was a guard there who was beating the sick ones and there was, you had maybe five minutes to get in there or something like that and then before you had to get back into formation.</sentence><sentence id="1421">And anyway, I did get diarrhea and I did get into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and surprisingly they had good food for the ones with the diarrhea, I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1422">And I managed to stay in there, like one way or another I managed to stay in there like eight or nine days, which was a fantastic break.</sentence><sentence id="1423">I didn't 04:31 have to work, the wound healed by itself from not being abraded all day and from getting a slightly different food and from being at rest.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And then I got back to the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where I was before and we were all working in all kinds of different units and one unit and this and that and the next day in a different unit and some, what we considered best was working inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because then we didn't have to march a long march out to the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> and a long march back to the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> and we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and get our food, and the 6 the soup at noon in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, which again was folly, because the ones who worked out there were distributed by different people who were not as greedy as the block chief and was more equitably distributed.</sentence><sentence id="1425">So I'm working out in the big <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> where the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> were, but outside the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and we were shoveling gravel from where the gravel crusher is tossing it and from there it's being loaded, spread out all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so the whole worksite will be covered with it and dust, stone dust all over and this was in maybe August.</sentence><sentence id="1426">I have it written down, but I didn't memorize the date and the white dust is falling all over and the boys are in a good mood, because the job is easy and there were no close supervision.</sentence><sentence id="1427">The Kapo was not nearby, the SS wasn't nearby and they are all talking and by that time I had a very bad reputation that I'll eat anything, that I'll eat breadcrumbs from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, that I'll eat potato peelings which others throw away and only that I'm just a pig and I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and when I come back, we all had our soup bowls with us, we always carried the soup bowl and the spoon which was assigned to us, which we kept and they tell me that a civilian was there and gave them a milk soup and would I like it?</sentence><sentence id="1428">I said, why didn't you eat it, they said, well we ate already and we left some for you, so I was kind of leery about it, but I start eating, being like I said a pig and greedy and all out for any bite of food and it doesn't taste right to me.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And I had put away maybe four or five tablespoons of it and it just doesn't taste right and finally one of them opened his mouth, pitch it, throw it out.</sentence><sentence id="1430">It turned out they got the white dust from the rocks and they poured water into it and they told me it's a milk soup for _, well it's <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so it doesn't taste like the home milk soup we had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we used to make it from sour cream.</sentence><sentence id="1431">Sure enough I got the diarrhea again.</sentence><sentence id="1432">They said, you're not going to be a sissy and go in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> again, are you?</sentence><sentence id="1433">I said, yes I am and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I told them I got the diarrhea, said prove it, I had no trouble proving it and in you go.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And I'm back again and says, you back again?</sentence><sentence id="1435">I said, yeah I'm back again, I got sick.</sentence><sentence id="1436">So, and this time the food was not quite as good as before but it was still good.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Still better than <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I still had rest, I was still lying in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the only time I had to sit up was for the head count and again, like eight or nine days, I say it was like an extension on my life.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And when I came back they all were deriding me, I wouldn't call teasing, it was much worse than teasing and heckling me and stuff like that, that you are a sissy and this and that and solidarity is what I call it, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1539">Q: But you heard about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1541">A: No, not until I was, years after the war I heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="1542">They got drunk and he and another SS or two other SS men and a work detail was returning from work and they just pulled out their pistols and started shooting into them and they were all written up as having died in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1543">But this one was a, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> work was in his blood, I mean he was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard from the year maybe and, this too I only found out when I read his write up or biography, which I obtained from, of all places, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, from that archives which they have there and that was maybe in "37 already was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And then he was at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and as he moved, each time he got higher and he knew the ways how to handle the stuff and he was tough on the guards and 10 times as tough on the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So by the time he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee(ph</span>) he was the Lager commandant or Lager Fuehrer as they called him and he was maybe a captain, Haupt Sturm Fuehrer, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1546">And as far as brutality, the brutality was the beaters, the prisoners themselves, who were there to do the beating and again there was one incident which, once I was in a fairly decent work detail, I mean, everything was chance and luck and if you tried to get into that again, sometimes you get pulled out of it and what --?,</sentence><sentence id="1547">so this work detail was working near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, near the <span class="BUILDING">Krema</span> [<span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>] on the other side of the <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> and Ebensee had it's own Krema after a while and we were digging huge <span class="DLF">pits</span> 04:45 for storing potatoes and beets for the winter and the SS who was in charge was probably a farmer in civilian and he was not so young, he may have been, I don't know, in the 40's and he was not particularly mean.</sentence><sentence id="1548">And the couple who was in charge of the work detail was a German, a redhead, freckled, with a horribly low number.</sentence><sentence id="1549">You knew that he was there an extremely long time, like I had a number 68,308 and the next 500 Jews came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>, 9 they were already 70 thousanders.</sentence><sentence id="1550">Two weeks later there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, they were already 72,000.</sentence><sentence id="1551">In October came the Poles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, who were captured during the Polish uprising, or crushed out, when it was crushed, they already had number 93,000 or 98,000.</sentence><sentence id="1552">So when somebody has a number with four digits, he was there a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1553">Then they started bringing the potatoes for those <span class="DLF">pits</span> and we were pouring them in and as we put, we store one here or one there and there all potatoes, they bring them in to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the evening after work and sort of snuggle to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, everybody was crowding around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and put them on the top and bake them or burn them or whatever, so they wouldn't be raw.</sentence><sentence id="1554">And one evening, this must have been in late November, it was dark already and we are coming back from work and at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> we are counted and the SS is relieved and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> is being opened and the SS around are watching that everybody goes in and ahead of us is standing another work detail and they are being frisked one by one by one, by a row of maybe four or five SS men.</sentence><sentence id="1555">They are just going through everybody for anything, I mean bringing in an empty paper bag was sabotage and punishable be a good beating, plenty beating and when we saw what's coming, we started reaching in for our potatoes, into the pockets and hiding them and where will we put them, but we were in the flood lens and the SS who were searching the ones in front of us said, oh, they are tossing away the potatoes already, don't even bother searching them, in they go as soon as they cross the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, 10 for everybody, 10 whips or 10 lashes, including the Kapo.</sentence><sentence id="1556">So as soon as we get in, the beaters grab us and they have there these huge barrels, just for that reason.</sentence><sentence id="1557">They grab you, toss you onto the barrel with the face down and beat on the rear with sticks and rubber hoses.</sentence><sentence id="1558">And I was screaming because he wasn't hitting my rear, he was hitting my coccyx and when we all got our beatings, the couple was still standing by and he says, if you want to come by to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> after supper, we'll just have a little get together.</sentence><sentence id="1559">So, and this other guy who was in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">work unit</span>, from my own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, a Jewish guy, a tall one, says to me, why were you yelling?</sentence><sentence id="1560">Said because he was hitting in my bone instead of my tail.</sentence><sentence id="1561">Well did it do you any good to yell, said why yell?</sentence><sentence id="1562">So about five of us Jewish kids or 10 from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, after supper, we went to his <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and it was Kapos only in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1563">And he told them to let us in and that was a completely different class, I mean the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were painted, I mean, many <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had whitewashed <span class="DLF">walls</span>, but this one was homey looking.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And they had all kinds of things and we were standing around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>, I mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, it was just the camaraderie on part of this Kapo, what I would call the fellowship of the beaten ones.</sentence><sentence id="1565">Again he was unique, he was remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="1566">And he had a, it was a pink triangle, which was, the Germans trusted criminals and German criminals and even pink triangles over any other foreigners and if you were German, you were 10 foot higher than a Polish prisoner or a French prisoner and you could be trusted to be assigned as a Kapo or a block chief or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1567">And on one of those mornings when we were marching out, we were going by the <span class="DLF">perimeter fence</span> and on it was a person hanging, dead.</sentence><sentence id="1568">Either tossed on it, or jumped on it.</sentence><sentence id="1569">We never knew, when somebody was dead, if somebody killed him, or if he committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1570">There was a man in my transport of 500 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> proper.</sentence><sentence id="1571">In other words, some of us were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span>, some were from hungary, some were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and as things got, they got mixed, sort of and this guy, I don't know what he was, he may have been an attorney and he was very intellectual and he looked down on everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1572">I mean a prisoner, but everybody to him was dirt compared to him and then he 0 was king, King Shit, in plain English.</sentence><sentence id="1573">And when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>, within one day we have, one evening we come back from work and there is the head count, Appell as they called it and one is missing and whenever one was missing, there was circus, everybody had to stand, remain standing, all formation and it was, it should have been so easy to find who was missing because every <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had a book on which the clerk wrote how many hour in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, you know, and the SS counted them already, how many were and checked off that yeah, there were so many, so one of them didn't count properly and he should have known which was.</sentence><sentence id="1574">So anyway, a recounting again, this time for sure and checking the numbers and they found which <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> is one shy, so beaters, Kapos, everybody, go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, into the camp area, this was a, the head count was in a square, like a <span class="DLF">plaza</span>, which was open and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, I mean it was to one side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, so into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, find them.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And they go through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, first of all go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where he is supposed to be and he's not there, so go all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, maybe he's hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, hiding here, hiding there, we'll beat all over with the sticks, look for, so finally they come back laughing.</sentence><sentence id="1576">The Jew was hanging on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1577">So he says, next time one of you Jews decides to kill himself, let us know in advance so we won't have to do all this searching and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1578">So for long months after that, I always said to myself, that man was a smart man, he was the only one with brains among us that he killed himself on the first week, before he went through so much suffering.</sentence><sentence id="1579">But, and that's how it entered in the book, in the register that he was, he committed suicide or something like that, they had funny words for everything, but then I started thinking about it and it occurred to me that this guy 04:55 was arrogant and it's not impossible that he might have incited a block chief or a Kapo or somebody who just strangled him on the spot and hanged him.</sentence><sentence id="1580">So you never know, I mean the dead ones don't talk and the ones who killed them wouldn't' talk, so, and with this guy I'll get to, I'll tell you my philosophy and the suffering which got me through it, because when we carried those pre-fab sections, it was horrible, real back-breaking work, I thought, it'll kill me and I couldn't believe that I survived it and I didn't want to die the next day, because I said if I survived that, I don't want to die now and then it was again some very hard work and somehow managed to survive and then just didn't want to kill myself, but it would have been a way out, so it just, one hardship after another hardship, sort of just kept me going.</sentence><sentence id="1581">If you survived that, you're not going to kill yourself now, I mean this is very bad, but not quite as bad as that was.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1631">A: I had an accident on the <span class="DLF">work site</span> on February 28.</sentence><sentence id="1632">It was one of those days when I felt very depressed and disgusted and I was pushing one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> on the <span class="DLF">work site</span> and the 1 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> came up behind, pushing another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> and the fellows were yelling at me to jump, get out from there and I didn't realize they were yelling at me and they were not, apparently make too much effort to yell at me or get me out of there, I got caught between the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and broke my wrist.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And immediately I was taken off the <span class="DLF">work site</span>, taken into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, report to SS, count one off from this work detail, they'll be coming in one short because he's coming in now and went to the, my clerk, block clerk, barracks clerk, who was a Pole who hated my guts because I always went to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he hated that.</sentence><sentence id="1634">He hated me for trying to get out of bad work details, so anyway, he walks me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he says, oh now you have it made, he says, the was will be over pretty soon and you can stay there until the end and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="1635">So I thought I had it made and even after war I thought I had it made, but what was the thing was I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish barracks</span>, the only place which was segregated inside the camp was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, they had one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for Aryan prisoners and one for Jewish and the ones in the Jewish got virtually nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1636">And I showed you the ID badge, which I had here when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, by end of April I could pull it up here without, I mean if I didn't adjust it.</sentence><sentence id="1637">And I was just losing weight something awful.</sentence><sentence id="1638">You could see it that my bones were sticking out, my ribs were sticking out and I saw people around me who looked like, I've never seen humans look that way.</sentence><sentence id="1639">I mean their chests look like they are sticking out like this, but it wasn't their chests were sticking out, it was their abdomens were completely sunk in and the pelvic bones were sticking out and the pelvic bones were sticking out in the front, on the side and the back and it was just frightful sight, I mean, I could figure that you could almost time yourself how soon you will be in that stage and they just used to grab them and toss them to the corner where there were the dead bodies and every day there was pile there, in every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And it was just, the soup was just a broth and so much of it, maybe half liter, which is nothing and the bread was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they used to get one-third of a bread and eventually they got cut down to one-quarter.</sentence><sentence id="1641">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they used to give us like less than one-eighth and after awhile it wasn't bread any more.</sentence><sentence id="1642">Instead of flour, they put into it sawdust, instead of flour there was like a potato and it taste like a and it was nothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

and I wanted out of there and Americans finally processed us, the <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital unit</span> on eighth of May, two days after the liberation, that's when they came in, that's when they swarmed into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital compound</span>, in came the photographers and in came the <span class="BUILDING">hospital units</span>, which later I found out was called a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> and they had pictures take, they were taking pictures of themselves with us and any way, they set up <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, portable

couldn't eat the food which they were giving us.</sentence><sentence id="1701">It was a very bad scenario, as you would call it.</sentence><sentence id="1702">And day by day I got closer to dying.</sentence><sentence id="1703">And then, the Americans kept those who wanted to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, plus they set up a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">hospital tent</span>, where they also kept prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1704">And they shipped out many prisoners from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.720687" long="13.637092">Bad Ischl</span>, which was a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they took over an <span class="BUILDING">SS hospital</span> there already, a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1705">So they spread out and the overcrowded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was decrowded and the prisoners, the Polish and the Russians were separated out right away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sent into a different camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which used to be before, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> and so on and so forth and the ones who were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, got hospital food, which was to me, was better than the yellow pea soup and on one occasion, I was always roaming around looking or scrounging or something and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> on which was used to haul the containers, the food containers and it was, the people were pulling it to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and it had on it the hospital food.</sentence><sentence id="1706">And everything was already, the German discipline was gone, the German organization was gone.</sentence><sentence id="1707">The containers no longer had the lids on them, the rubber gaskets were gone from the lids, nobody cared about anything, it was a big deal to be able to, the 4 Americans or the prisoner committee managed to talk the cooks into staying on and cooking food for the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1708">They felt the war is over and they don't have to work any more and there is no reason why, everybody's free and why they shouldn't be free.</sentence><sentence id="1709">So anyway, the food was sloshing from these containers and I got my bowl under it and I was collecting it and then I ate that soup and it was, to me it was at least something I could eat.</sentence><sentence id="1710">There was only one catch, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> on which they were hauling the food was used the day before for hauling the dead bodies and some of the dead bodies were, maybe had, feces were coming out of them, nobody washed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1711">In other words, what I was getting was maybe excrement from dead bodies and I got the shits and it wouldn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="1712">I was free and I was closer to death than ever before.</sentence><sentence id="1713">And I got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and I still had the diarrhea and even the Czechs couldn't cure it, nobody could cure it, it took a long time, until a friend of the family got me some cocoa and that stopped it.</sentence><sentence id="1714">So, there's another one to whom I owe quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="1715">He's still alive today, he's in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1742">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1744">Q: Off the top.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1746">A: That's one of the photos, which the American Signal Corp. photographers took in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span> when they came into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Hospital barracks</span> and I happen to be on this one, the second one from the right.</sentence><sentence id="1747">As you can see, some of us had, were skinnier than I and my knees were sticking out, my ribs are visible and both my legs and my arms are rather skinny.</sentence><sentence id="1748">And I turned to the side, facing to the right, for what I would call positive identification, because I have a scar from an operation over the left ear and I always wanted to show that and for let's say someday it will be seen somewhere and I could definitely be sure that it's, prove it that that's me, that is I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1752">Q: Physically you were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1754">A: And my memory is not infallible, I can't tell you exactly when this picture was taken, it may have been taken in 1941 or "42.</sentence><sentence id="1755">On the left side is my brother, the middle is my mother and the right side am I, I am and I can tell you for sure that at this point I was already in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> because each <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had a cap, sort of like a uniform cap and my brother is wearing the one from the <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> and I already am not wearing the one from the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Gymnasium</span> and there was not yet <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Gymnasium</span> cap so it's somewhere in between, it's definitely 1941 or later.</sentence><sentence id="1756">This is after I recovered, after the war, I believe in, late in "46.</sentence><sentence id="1757">It took me awhile before my hair started to grow again, it was probably one of the reasons, I mean vitamin deficiency, it took my body a good number of months to get back to, let's say, in condition or anything, or normal and to put on some weight.</sentence><sentence id="1758">On the Ebensee photo, I weigh about 30 kilograms, on this one I suppose it's around 60, 65 kilograms.</sentence><sentence id="1759">Many, many decades after Ebensee, like around 1978, when I lived in the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span>, I found out that the Ebensee, the Mauthausen register of prisoners is in the 5 national archives and I went to look at it and it's in numerical order, so I'd no problem finding my entry on it, we all know our prisoner numbers, mine happened to be 68,308 and when I came upon it, it was just kind of earth shaking or whatever, I don't know, very upsetting and it was like, later on I got a copy of a page for a friend on which his name was and he says to me that it was like a page out of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and I think those words are about as apt as you can find and the ones who perished or were killed are crossed out with a <span class="DLF">line</span>, with red ink and those who died after a certain date are no longer crossed out because the book was kept only up to perhaps the last week in April, 1945, so anybody died the last week of April or the beginning of May, it seems that he's still alive, but he isn't.</sentence><sentence id="1760">Because they didn't get the chance to cross out his name and this one is my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1761">As I found out, the day after the liberation, from another prisoner who happened to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where he was, he was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span>, which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and as you see, most of these are youngsters.</sentence><sentence id="1762">You can see there his date of birth is entered as 1930 or actually it was 1931.You can see there are dates are also young ones there, like 1929, 1930 and they probably were also lying about their ages so they might have been even younger than that.</sentence><sentence id="1763">And again, these names of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> same way we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we never heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, we never heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>, I never knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> and the way this guy pronounced it, I thought it was Kuszen or something like that and many years later I saw it in print and it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> and there is the date on which he died and, but I managed to obtain that date about a year, or two years after the war when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, somebody told me about an international refugee organization and they gave me the date then, which again, I did not know until then.</sentence><sentence id="1764">I had no idea if he's still alive somewhere or not.</sentence><sentence id="1765">These are my maternal grandparents, who were so dear to me and who were so nice to me and who's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was like a refuge to me, many a times.</sentence><sentence id="1766">And with whom I could talk even more at ease or more closely that with my own parents.</sentence><sentence id="1767">Fannie Moskowitz and Samuel Moskowitz, David Samuel Moskowitz.</sentence><sentence id="1768">This is the prison bracelet which I have from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span> and bears my number, 68,308 and as I explained, when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I could wear it on my wrist and then as I lost weight, I could bring it up all the way to my, virtually upper arm, I mean to the top of my forearm.</sentence><sentence id="1769">And the wire on it is from a blasting wire from the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> project.</sentence><sentence
