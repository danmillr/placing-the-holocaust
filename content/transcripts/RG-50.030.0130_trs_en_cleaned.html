<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="159">When the Germans came in, my father...1 mean actually we were...we had no food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">It was not like here.</sentence><sentence id="161">You had always something in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">In Europe, everything you need, you used to go out every day in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, and you used to buy.</sentence><sentence id="163">When the war broke out, the water was cut off.</sentence><sentence id="164">There was no gas in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to cook anything.</sentence><sentence id="165">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="166">So my father used to go out once in a while and we used to get some bread or the necessary things.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember for a couple of weeks, we lived just on sour pickles because not far where we used to live, a couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span>, there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, they used to produce pickles.</sentence><sentence id="168">A <span class="BUILDING">Polish factory</span>!</sentence><sentence id="169">And they call it Original, and they used to have the pickles in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> like...small <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>, and large ones.</sentence><sentence id="170">As I found out, so I went with a friend of mine and somehow we got in to that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the night, even when the bombs were falling and we used to run in the middle of the night and we grabbed about 6 or 8 cans, about 5 pounds and we dragged it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and this we lived for a couple of weeks.</sentence><sentence id="171">Just on pickles!And once in a while, we got bread.</sentence><sentence id="172">But we had some rice.</sentence><sentence id="173">So we had rice and pickles.</sentence><sentence id="174">And this went on for...for weeks.</sentence><sentence id="175">There were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> burning.</sentence><sentence id="176">I mean it was...to describe a regular</sentence><sentence id="178">hell, because there was no water to douche the fires out, so the only thing they did was let the fires go.</sentence><sentence id="179">It just happened the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived that nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="180">Like next <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, third <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, in the night when it stopped, people used to go out from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and look for something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="181">And this kept on for 4 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="182">When the Germans came in, so they didn't know what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="183">New rules.</sentence><sentence id="184">New Regime.</sentence><sentence id="185">They first thing they did, they made a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="186">You are not allowed to walk the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">But still there was no food.</sentence><sentence id="188">So the only thing they did was on the corner someplace like it happens someplaces, they used to have <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchens</span>, and they used to give to the people bread and salamis.</sentence><sentence id="189">This is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="190">Right when they walked in.</sentence><sentence id="191">I found this it out through a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="192">When you go over there, let's say maybe 3 miles, 4 miles, there is a <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">You gonna go over there, you gonna get something.</sentence><sentence id="194">I remember like now I took my older sister.</sentence><sentence id="195">We walked and we walked and...and still the fires were on both sides, but the war was ended already.</sentence><sentence id="196">They occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">We came over there.</sentence><sentence id="198">We saw a <span class="DLF">line</span> of people, and we stood in the <span class="DLF">line</span> for that bread and the salami and sometime they gave you two breads.</sentence><sentence id="199">When I got to the <span class="DLF">line</span>, a Pole...a Polish kid came out and said to the German, "He's Jude."</sentence><sentence id="200">You know like...the German didn't even know that time...he didn't make any difference between a Jew and not a Jew; but the Polish kids, they were pointing out to the Germans, like "Don't give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="201">He's a Jew."</sentence><sentence id="202">So now they got the way... So the German couldn't do anything, I mean.</sentence><sentence id="203">So he chased us away.</sentence><sentence id="204">So when he chased us away, we stood again.</sentence><sentence id="205">So now, the Polish kids, they chased us away and they grabbed all the bread, and all the things.</sentence><sentence id="206">So we had to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without bread and without anything.</sentence><sentence id="207">And it was a fact that we had to go carry water from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>; and this is like 4 miles.</sentence><sentence id="208">So we took 2 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> of water.</sentence><sentence id="209">Me and my sister took 2 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> of water, and we walked.</sentence><sentence id="210">We carried the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> so when we had to pass by a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish neighborhood</span>, those Polish kids came out and picked up the pails of water and threw it out and make us walk back.</sentence><sentence id="211">Now this is in a time when the Germans took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">Every citizen was on his own, and they know they lost their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">Still the hatred.</sentence><sentence id="214">The anti- Semitism those Polish people had toward the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="215">For no reason at all!</sentence><sentence id="216">Now they felt that they can do with the German help what they always want to do.</sentence><sentence id="217">And here they got somebody to point out he's a Jew's and he's a this, and he's a that, and when they walked around with the water, they used to turn the water out from those kids, cause elderly people couldn't carry that far pails of water.</sentence><sentence id="218">So this went on for a couple of weeks.</sentence><sentence id="219">You know with that <span class="NPIP">thing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">Finally, the occupation was starting, and they started giving you anti-Jewish laws, and I remember like now, in November, I think it was in November or September, there was a <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Nalevki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And somehow a Polish...a German soldier got shot.</sentence><sentence id="222">I don't know how or why.</sentence><sentence id="223">This is the first time I heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="224">They took out 53 people from that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, men, women, children, and they killed them instantly.</sentence><sentence id="225">This is maybe 2 weeks after they walked in....in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">And...and I don't now that...what happened with that soldier, how he got shot over there, and this was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span>, you know, and they took out 53 people and they killed them.</sentence><sentence id="227">And since then everybody knew that something terrible is going to happen to the Jewish people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">District</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">Now what happened to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> is that the German's find out about my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, so every day you see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in and they loaded up.</sentence><sentence id="229">They cleaned out little by little everything.</sentence><sentence id="230">My father and my grandfather, we grabbed some stuff and we kept it in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">Not much because you</sentence><sentence id="233">couldn't grab too much.</sentence><sentence id="234">And little by little, they cleaned out the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, they cleaned out the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">They took away the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">Everything they loaded up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I don't know where they had it.</sentence><sentence id="237">So from that little merchandize, what we saved from that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, we lived awhile.</sentence><sentence id="238">We sold little by little and somehow this kept us going for let's say, maybe 2 years, you know.</sentence><sentence id="239">And after...this was around 1941...1942.</sentence><sentence id="240">1941 or 42 it start getting very bad, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed in.</sentence><sentence id="241">They made a <span class="DLF">wall</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">I had to wear a arm band with the star of David.</sentence><sentence id="243">Say everybody, even the smallest children...my littlest sister, a little tiny girl...she had to walk out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, she had a arm band, you know, with a...with a star of David.</sentence><sentence id="244">And everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had always ready, uh, how you say a rucksack with a piece of bread, some stuff, in case something happened every kid will be protected.</sentence><sentence id="245">That was my father's idea.</sentence><sentence id="246">We don't know what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="247">First day here, they clean out this <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">They clean out this <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">You walk out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">You don't know if you gonna come back, because they ...you walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they need 100 people to go to work, they grab you and you don't...they don't know what happened to you.</sentence><sentence id="251">When we lived in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, we lived near a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">One time each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had like a committee, and they were directing all the rules.</sentence><sentence id="253">One time there was a meeting and they said they need 35 people to go to work.</sentence><sentence id="254">So who'll they take?</sentence><sentence id="255">Elderly people, they can't take.</sentence><sentence id="256">The youngsters they can't take, so they took 17, 18, 19 year old people.</sentence><sentence id="257">And from that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by us, we had to give them 3 people.</sentence><sentence id="258">So each <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, like 10 <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, used to give 30 people.</sentence><sentence id="259">And 3 people that went, 18, 19, they were 6 weeks away.</sentence><sentence id="260">When they came back, nobody recognized them.</sentence><sentence id="261">Each one was swelling.</sentence><sentence id="262">I remember that I had a friend.</sentence><sentence id="263">His name was Schemick.</sentence><sentence id="264">He came back.</sentence><sentence id="265">His feet, his hand, his head were twice the size from the beating, from the undernourishment those people had.</sentence><sentence id="266">What did they do?</sentence><sentence id="267">They dig some kind of <span class="DLF">dam</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">They were standing all day long in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> in digging the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and from this they got swelling, and they were undernourished, and this kid lived about 2 weeks after they send him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he died because he was so sick.</sentence><sentence id="269">And this kept on like this, and my father was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">My mother was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">My sisters were <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and still we went some...and...in time of the night, we had schooling, like people made a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 3, 4 children.</sentence><sentence id="272">They shouldn't forget what they learn, and we had <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">We went in the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">We read books.</sentence><sentence id="275">We still think sometime sometime will get better.</sentence><sentence id="276">In the meanwhile, we had...there was a Polish newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="277">Actually it was a newspaper where the German printed but in Polish language, and this was smuggled in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we read it.</sentence><sentence id="278">We heard only about the Germans winning the war and they win this and this and this.</sentence><sentence id="279">We didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="280">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> was not allowed to have because they took all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> from the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="281">They took away one night and made a decree, everybody has a radio, fall coats, good clothes, this has to be given away.</sentence><sentence id="282">And we didn't have no news actually what happened on the other <span class="NPIP">side of</span> the <span class="NPIP">world</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">And this went on like this until 1942.42 came the big day when they start staying to the people well, we need people to go Ost [NB: to the east], means for work.</sentence><sentence id="284">And the hunger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so great, was so bad, those people were laying on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and dying, little children went around begging, and, uh, everyday you walked out in the morning, you see somebody is laying dead, covered with newspapers or with any kind of blanket they found, and you found those people used to carry the death people in little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, used to bring them down to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and bury them in</sentence><sentence id="286"><span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">And every day thousands and thousands died just from malnutrition because the Germans didn't give anything for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to eat.</sentence><sentence id="288">There was no such thing.</sentence><sentence id="289">You couldn't walk in and buy anything or getting any rations.</sentence><sentence id="290">It's your pot luck.</sentence><sentence id="291">If you don't have it, you die, and that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="292">Finally when they start bringing people out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they promised the people, if you gonna leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we'll give you 3...3 pounds of bread and, uh, a can of marmalade and sugar and stuff like this.</sentence><sentence id="293">And if you just register, you want to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">Some people if they heard that word, 3 pounds of bread and marmalade and sugar, they didn't care what's going to happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="295">They just went and they signed up.</sentence><sentence id="296">Actually, it's not signed up because when they...when they went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, they got the bread and the marmalade and you see every day women, children walking to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, Umschlagplatz, and get the 3 breads.</sentence><sentence id="297">And they pushed them into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>; and they pushed in so many people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that they actually couldn't eat that bread.</sentence><sentence id="298">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> even to cut the bread.</sentence><sentence id="299">So what happened.</sentence><sentence id="300">Well, they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> came back with the same bread because in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> they used to put in 350 to 400 people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> and you had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only.</sentence><sentence id="302">You couldn't even sit.</sentence><sentence id="303">You couldn't even stand.</sentence><sentence id="304">You were just pressed like sardines.</sentence><sentence id="305">So the bread and the marmalade when the people had it in their hands, it was still in their hands because when they get to destination in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, they had to undress and they had to leave everything.</sentence><sentence id="306">So the same breads and the same marmalade came back for the new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">And this went on constantly.</sentence><sentence id="308">Now the 22nd of July 1942, that was the day when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there was, uh, a...a raid.</sentence><sentence id="309">The SS came, start shooting, start hollering everybody down, everybody down in the <span class="DLF">court yard</span>, and I said to my mother, "What we gonna do?"</sentence><sentence id="310">So she says, "You don't have to worry.</sentence><sentence id="311">I got a paper.</sentence><sentence id="312">Your daddy works."</sentence><sentence id="313">My father was working as a mechanic in a...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the...for the...in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> they used to make fur coats for the German flyers...for the pilots.</sentence><sentence id="314">So he was like taking care of all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machineries</span> and she has a paper that her husband works for the Germans so she says, "Don't worry, I mean."</sentence><sentence id="315">I says, "But I have to worry because I am over 17.</sentence><sentence id="316">And if they see me, they will grab me."</sentence><sentence id="317">So she says, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="318">You go hide."</sentence><sentence id="319">So I was hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she went downstairs with my 3 sisters.</sentence><sentence id="320">Everybody was having that...that thing on the back of the thing with a piece of bread with a...with a schmatles (ph) inside.</sentence><sentence id="321">I don't know what they keep <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">And that's how they went downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="323">And this is the...the last time I saw them.</sentence><sentence id="324">Because the Germans even if they saw the paper, they just took the paper like this and ripped it apart and they took them out.</sentence><sentence id="325">That time they took about 10,000 people to the place <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> took the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">I was laying, hidden in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the top of the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">They made like a <span class="INT_SPACE">blind room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">If you wouldn't know it, you wouldn't know it's a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">But it's actually was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">hideaway</span> on the top of the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">And I was laying there, and I heard the Germans came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they take them out downstairs, and I was laying there.</sentence><sentence id="331">I didn't know what to do, what to say.</sentence><sentence id="332">And I figured because of the paper, he's going to read the paper and he's going to say, "Oh, well, and he's going to let him stay."</sentence><sentence id="333">And he tell them to go downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="334">In the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, there was already hundreds of people like this, and they took them away.</sentence><sentence id="335">This was around 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="336">And this was that day on July 1942.</sentence><sentence id="337">And another thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="338">If they have, uh, a norm.</sentence><sentence id="339">That means they need 10,000 people every day, and if they had 8,000, they just went around on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and just grabbed everybody who comes</sentence><sentence id="341">along to make the 10,000 up.</sentence><sentence id="342">And that's what probably happened that day.</sentence><sentence id="343">They needed a couple of hundred more, and...and where we used to live was only about 10, 15 minutes from their <span class="DLF">Umshagplatz</span> where all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, so the first thing they did, ran into those <span class="DLF">court yards</span>, and they grabbed the people.</sentence><sentence id="344">And after this, uh, 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told him what happened and I said to him, "Well, I...L...I can't be here anymore."</sentence><sentence id="345">You know, like I just can't find myself a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">First of all, I says you go away in the morning to work.</sentence><sentence id="347">I have to stay here by myself.</sentence><sentence id="348">And I don't know what can happen.</sentence><sentence id="349">Any minute they can grab me too because I have no papers.</sentence><sentence id="350">I don't work.</sentence><sentence id="351">And if you don't have no papers, you don't work.</sentence><sentence id="352">It's just like, uh, you don't exist.</sentence><sentence id="353">So I don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="354">So I spoke...I had a friend of mine...a kid I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with him, and he told me, "There is a guy who lives next <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he works on the on the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> for the Germans and he says for a couple... for some money he can arrange...that he can have a few people going to work in the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">This is a good job, and you can stay there and at least you're going to be safe a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="356">I told this to my father and I said to him, you know, we're going to need 2 or 3 thousand zlotys to pay off this guy cause this guy is going to pay off a German.</sentence><sentence id="357">And in that book I gave you is the whole story from that thing, but I just gonna tell you what happened.</sentence><sentence id="358">That's...some day he came.</sentence><sentence id="359">My father gave him the money.</sentence><sentence id="360">I took with me...1 remember like now...I took with me a leather briefcase.</sentence><sentence id="361">I took with me maybe 200 zlotys.</sentence><sentence id="362">That's all there was left, and I took with me some underwear and tfillin.</sentence><sentence id="363">My father says, "You take this."</sentence><sentence id="364">And I went because I was Bar mitzvah year before.</sentence><sentence id="365">So I didn't have a chance even to wear it.</sentence><sentence id="366">He says, "Take it with you."</sentence><sentence id="367">So I went and I took this.</sentence><sentence id="368">And I remember like now the guy took us and we walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...what nobody is allowed to walk, but he had a paper from the...from the...from the German Air Force, that he's bringing some people to work for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> or something, so... And I saw these German SS.</sentence><sentence id="369">They're walking around and looking at us, see somebody and here they see four people walking in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> with any kind of fear with this look in them, so one soldier came over he asks for Ausweiss, so we showed him the paper and he says, "Go ahead."</sentence><sentence id="370">If you walked about about maybe 20 minutes and after I saw...I was there, I saw a German in an air force uniform waiting for us.</sentence><sentence id="371">He had half a hand because he must have been shot or something, so he's got...one arm was loose and he came over and he spoke to this guy and the says to him, three guys.</sentence><sentence id="372">He put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>, you know, because a Jew was not allowed to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">And here we got those things you know because we are afraid to take it off.</sentence><sentence id="374">So he said to us, "We should take them off and he is going to stay with us, and he paid for us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>, those tickets, and we went all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="375">Okence (ph) is like <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy Airport</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, you know, like.</sentence><sentence id="376">And I was over there...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph), I was over there 16 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="377">RIght.</sentence><sentence id="378">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph) from May...No...from July, August...No.</sentence><sentence id="379">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Okence</span> (ph)...I went August, September, November...3 months....4 months...16 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="380">And we didn't know what happened to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">We know that there's no people left over there.</sentence><sentence id="382">Everybody is out.</sentence><sentence id="383">I didn't know what happened to my father.</sentence><sentence id="384">I didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="385">And I was there 16 weeks, and we worked by coal.</sentence><sentence id="386">We unload <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coal for the Germans used to use for heating up the systems and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coals went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">So this was mine job, to unload and load coals.</sentence><sentence id="388">And once we clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>...once in a while they took us to clean out the</sentence><sentence id="390"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military airplanes</span>, little things like this, not major stuff.</sentence><sentence id="391">And they used to feed us, maybe 2 slices of bread a day and a soup, a watery soup.</sentence><sentence id="392">But we had good <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> to sleep because in those <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> used to sleep the soldiers and this was an empty <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> so we had to sleep, we had good <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">There's no... We had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">This is very unusual and, uh, the only thing was no was no food.</sentence><sentence id="395">So that money that I have, a couple of hundred zlotys, this lasts me for awhile to buy myself, and over there where we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, I used to take coal.</sentence><sentence id="396">I used to stuff myself in mine coat, and the coat used to weigh 20 pounds because I used to cut out the underline and used to stuff with coals.</sentence><sentence id="397">When I walked from the...from the <span class="DLF">air field</span> back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, I used to ask the soldiers, the German air force...they weren't that bad...the air force.</sentence><sentence id="398">They weren't that bad because they probably were not indoctrinated like the German SS or the Gestapo, so I used to say to him, "You see how dirty I was. (</sentence><sentence id="399">in German) I have to buy soap to wash my face."</sentence><sentence id="400">He said, "Sure."</sentence><sentence id="401">So they used to walk slow.</sentence><sentence id="402">I used to run across the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">There was little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> from Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="404">They have little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="405">They used to sell bread.</sentence><sentence id="406">They used to sell soap.</sentence><sentence id="407">They used to sell candies.</sentence><sentence id="408">And I used to go in and I used to say in Polish to them, "You want a coal."</sentence><sentence id="409">Oh, they were...they went crazy, because they weren't allowed to have coal.</sentence><sentence id="410">I mean the Germans took everything away.</sentence><sentence id="411">And I used to walk like this.</sentence><sentence id="412">I bend down, I scouped everything up, put in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> and they gave me sometimes...they gave me a half a bread.</sentence><sentence id="413">Sometimes they gave me some a piece of salami.</sentence><sentence id="414">Sometime they gave me some candies.</sentence><sentence id="415">Sometimes a pack of cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="416">I mean, that's all I need.</sentence><sentence id="417">I didn't need no money.</sentence><sentence id="418">I need to bargain with them.</sentence><sentence id="419">I need to deal with them.</sentence><sentence id="420">And this went on for quite awhile.</sentence><sentence id="421">Once I heard there's people starting to run away, from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and I says, "Where do they running?"</sentence><sentence id="422">They found out that some people still live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="423">And I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="424">I didn't know where to run...to who to run.</sentence><sentence id="425">And this every night, I used to sleep and I used to think how will I get out from here.</sentence><sentence id="426">Maybe my father's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="427">Maybe my mother came back.</sentence><sentence id="428">Who knows?</sentence><sentence id="429">And I was a young kid at that time.</sentence><sentence id="430">I was a baby.</sentence><sentence id="431">I was 16 years old, I mean I didn't know even how to think straight.</sentence><sentence id="432">But once it was winter...it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="433">Was dark already when we walked back.</sentence><sentence id="434">I heard a Pole calling my name.</sentence><sentence id="435">He was standing on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">And we walked to the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> like to the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>, and he called my name.</sentence><sentence id="437">He says in Polish, "Is there a Lewent here?"</sentence><sentence id="438">And my name in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is Levent, not Lewent.</sentence><sentence id="439">And I heard that, I says "Yes," and I started to run to him and the German thought I am going to run away, he walloped me with a rifle right in my stomach and I fell right down.</sentence><sentence id="440">So the Pole, he saw that he said, he's going to be back tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="441">Like this.</sentence><sentence id="442">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I couldn't sleep anymore.</sentence><sentence id="443">I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="444">I really hurt.</sentence><sentence id="445">This is the first time I saw them hitting somebody.</sentence><sentence id="446">He thought I am going to runaway you know because he saw me running out from the <span class="DLF">line</span> of people and after that, tomorrow, the same time, he's there.</sentence><sentence id="447">He calls me.</sentence><sentence id="448">That time, I was smarter.</sentence><sentence id="449">I kept myself to the end, not in the middle, and to the end, and I said to him, "I am going to go buy something."</sentence><sentence id="450">And he went and he gave me a piece of paper...put me a end a piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="451">And I grabbed a hold of piece of paper like this, and I went back in the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">I came in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">I opened up the piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="454">My father wrote me a letter, and he says that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">He still works in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">And I shouldn't try to escape.</sentence><sentence id="457">He's gonna get me somebody to take me out and bring me to him.</sentence><sentence id="458">And this was in December 1940...42.</sentence><sentence id="459">I couldn't wait.</sentence><sentence id="460">After 1 day...after the second day or the third day,</sentence><sentence id="462">nobody shows up.</sentence><sentence id="463">It's a week already, nobody shows up.</sentence><sentence id="464">So I says... said to my friend, Landau, I says, "You know I am gonna...i am gonna run away."</sentence><sentence id="465">He says, "Don't do it.</sentence><sentence id="466">They're gonna shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="467">Don't do it, you know."</sentence><sentence id="468">I says, "No, I'll figure out something."</sentence><sentence id="469">So one night I remember like now, it was about Thursday.</sentence><sentence id="470">This was the 30th of December before New Years, between Christmas and New Years.</sentence><sentence id="471">And I did the same trick.</sentence><sentence id="472">I had coals with me, and I was dirty black, the face and the hands, you know, like anything...and I asked the same guy.</sentence><sentence id="473">He was an elderly man.</sentence><sentence id="474">And I said to him, "I'm gonna buy soap to wash myself."</sentence><sentence id="475">And he says, "Go ahead" "Come right back," he says. "</sentence><sentence id="476">Come right back."</sentence><sentence id="477">I went over there and I got all these coals, and at that time, she says to me...the woman, she says to me in Polish, "No," she says, "Little boy, what do you want today?</sentence><sentence id="478">Do you wanta bread or you wanta milk?"</sentence><sentence id="479">I said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="480">I need some money today."</sentence><sentence id="481">She said, "I can't give you no money, you know."</sentence><sentence id="482">I says, "I'll tell you what.</sentence><sentence id="483">For the whole thing, just give me two dollars-- two zlotys.</sentence><sentence id="484">I am going to have fare on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="485">I didn't tell her this.</sentence><sentence id="486">So she took out and she gave it to me.</sentence><sentence id="487">But she gave me change.</sentence><sentence id="488">That's what I needed.</sentence><sentence id="489">And I went and...I never went back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">formation</span>, and I walked...1 was dark.</sentence><sentence id="490">I was dirty, so they didn't recognize me, and I took off this.</sentence><sentence id="491">This was the worse thing I did.</sentence><sentence id="492">You should never take this off.</sentence><sentence id="493">And I went and I jumped on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and I didn't go <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, you know, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="494">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> was on the end...the end...and I turned my face and I gave that lady 30 groszen (ph), and I says, "I am gonna...because I have to take another one.</sentence><sentence id="495">I remember now what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> to take.</sentence><sentence id="496">She didn't say.</sentence><sentence id="497">She gave me a ticket, and I was standing and standing and standing.</sentence><sentence id="498">Then I said to myself, "Oh, I wish it's over.</sentence><sentence id="499">It's over again."</sentence><sentence id="500">And I went with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> about maybe 10 blocks, 20 blocks.</sentence><sentence id="501">Next to me there was a Pole standing, and I remember like now, he was a little hunchback and he had, uh, a sack.</sentence><sentence id="502">Maybe it was garbage <span class="NPIP">inside</span> or something, and I saw he looks at me, he looks at me, he looks at me, and I tried to turn my face away, and he keeps looking.</sentence><sentence id="503">Finally, he got right next to me, and he says to me in Polish, "What are you doing here."</sentence><sentence id="504">I didn't answer.</sentence><sentence id="505">I make believe I didn't hear him.</sentence><sentence id="506">And he says again, "What are you doing here."</sentence><sentence id="507">Finally, he got violent.</sentence><sentence id="508">He did it like this to me, you know.

hollered to her, "Come here.</sentence><sentence id="2339">You know what I need some food, you know, to eat."</sentence><sentence id="2340">So she gave us some food.</sentence><sentence id="2341">But I saw her looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2342">She looked...she looked <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2343">I don't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="2344">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2345">And what do you think?</sentence><sentence id="2346">In the <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span>, there was a little girl, maybe 4 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2347">She was...she hid.</sentence><sentence id="2348">I went to her and I says, "Do you think I am going to harm you little girl?</sentence><sentence id="2349">Do you think I am going to be just like you people were?</sentence><sentence id="2350">I am not going to harm you, little girl.</sentence><sentence id="2351">You don't have to hide on the <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2352">She didn't say a word, you know, when I said this to her.</sentence><sentence id="2353">But this little girl was laying in that <span class="BUILDING">dog house</span> hidden because she thought that...because this what they did to us, we're gonna to do to them.</sentence><sentence id="2354">And the same thing is when the Germans threw away those rifles by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I couldn't have picked up a rifle and killed all I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2355">I couldn't even move.</sentence><sentence id="2356">I couldn't even pick that rifle up from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2357">Probably maybe if I could, I would have feel maybe I would do it.</sentence><sentence id="2358">I couldn't even do this.</sentence><sentence id="2359">I couldn't even lift up the rifle that was laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> because first of all they are very heavy and second of all, I am not the type to kill anybody or to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="2360">First, in...in...especially when the war was going on, you could have walked around in every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do anything you wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2361">Nobody did those things.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Nobody did any revenging and killing just for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="2363">I don't remember those things.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And I saw people like me...there was no men, only women and children, because older men were in the war.</sentence><sentence id="2365">Nobody did any revenge .</sentence><sentence id="2366">And after this, they took us...yah, the MPs stopped us...2 MPs...Yes...and asked where are we going.</sentence><sentence id="2367">So I told him we were on a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> from the army and now we gonna go.</sentence><sentence id="2368">We're looking for friends or family.</sentence><sentence id="2369">You know, do you say, "That's the only thing you had on your mind."</sentence><sentence id="2370">So they say, "You can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="2371">You are not allowed.</sentence><sentence id="2372">No.</sentence><sentence id="2373">You're now allowed to do this."</sentence><sentence id="2374">That was just war time.</sentence><sentence id="2375">You are not allowed to do this.</sentence><sentence id="2376">So they took us, put us in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>, and took us away, and point was already more people over there.</sentence><sentence id="2377">And this was that <span class="BUILDING">Camp Felderink</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="2378">ph) This was in the time...when in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was still the German Army was still living in those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2379">So, the American Army</sentence><sentence id="2381">2 wants to put us in over there.</sentence><sentence id="2382">There was 30 people.</sentence><sentence id="2383">So we said, "We are not gonna live with them.</sentence><sentence id="2384">You chase them out.</sentence><sentence id="2385">You chase them out, we're gonna go in.</sentence><sentence id="2386">We're not gonna stay with them."</sentence><sentence id="2387">So anyway, they went out, and they moved us in.</sentence><sentence id="2388">And that's how that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> started to become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2389">That's how that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Felderink</span> started to become a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for DP.You know a lot of people came from all kind <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">liberation camps</span> and they put them in..in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2390">And there was other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, not only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Felderink</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2391">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzheim</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2392">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2393">There was, uh, oh, there was a lot of them all around, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2394">All those people that were liberated from the Army.</sentence><sentence id="2395">And after awhile you start... even right after the liberation, people right away starting to...to make committee, to start learning, to make a newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2396">There was printing a newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2397">Right away they're looking for <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> and I remember like now, there was a newspaper printed with...with German ABC, but it's written in Yiddish, because there was no Yiddish words in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And who was doing this?</sentence><sentence id="2399">The Germans were printing that newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2400">And all kind of little things shows to you that's how fast the people...the Jewish people raising up from the ashes, and right away they start building up a <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2401">And some people got married.</sentence><sentence id="2402">Some people find girlfriends.</sentence><sentence id="2403">Some people travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to see if anybody is alive.</sentence><sentence id="2404">Some people went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and put little names on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2405">I am looking for this and this and this man and maybe you saw my sister.</sentence><sentence id="2406">Her name was like this.</sentence><sentence id="2407">Maybe you saw my father.</sentence><sentence id="2408">I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with them.</sentence><sentence id="2409">And any <span class="NPIP">place</span> you went, you saw hundreds and hundreds of little pieces of paper written down with names in case somebody saw somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2410">And that's what kept us going to look.</sentence><sentence id="2411">Maybe you'll find somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2412">Oh, did you see this?</sentence><sentence id="2413">Or where is this?</sentence><sentence id="2414">And maybe you found somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2415">Oh yes, I saw him over there this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2416">Right away, you went and you...you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or by somebody to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and look up.</sentence><sentence id="2417">What that means after 5 years of torture!</sentence><sentence id="2418">What we went through for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="2419">Only thing is because you were born Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2420">The...they say...uh...[ remember for instance in the time when I went from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...one for instance, and I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I was working for a person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2421">I was a kid.</sentence><sentence id="2422">He paid me 20 Zlotys a week.</sentence><sentence id="2423">He collected schmettes from those tailors, little leftovers.</sentence><sentence id="2424">He made big veils, and he give this...he sold it to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2425">Not he sold it...this was his job.</sentence><sentence id="2426">And I was working for him, so one day we loaded up a full <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of those things and we have to take them to the <span class="NPIP">German place</span>, and he had a piece of paper that's to let us out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2427">And a woman used to have the piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="2428">She carried the piece of paper for six people.</sentence><sentence id="2429">And this was around Christmas 1940 or 41.</sentence><sentence id="2430">And I saw Polish people that were dancing.</sentence><sentence id="2431">Christmas is coming.</sentence><sentence id="2432">Everybody...the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> are nice,

stand 6 people.</sentence><sentence id="2436">I remember like now.</sentence><sentence id="2437">Six people destined to death, and here that woman walked away with a piece of
