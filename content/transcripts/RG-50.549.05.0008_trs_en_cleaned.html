know?</sentence><sentence id="7597">They have a very bad opinion of what's happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7598">It's happening here, too.</sentence><sentence id="7599">This is much smaller and what's happening here, when you open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span>, they start the killing.</sentence><sentence id="7600">Okay, it's a family killing or whatever but it's happening.</sentence><sentence id="7601">It's happening here, too.</sentence><sentence id="7602">And it's always worse for the people who don't live in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7603">You know, it seems much worse.</sentence><sentence id="7604">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="7605">I wasn't afraid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="7606">Once I was very afraid, when I sold my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have to give back <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span>, and they were coming.</sentence><sentence id="7607">And he said that he wants it for his family.</sentence><sentence id="7608"><span class="BUILDING">Baloney</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7609">He made a business from it.</sentence><sentence id="7610">He made from a two-family house, four families.</sentence><sentence id="7611">For money, he's getting rent.</sentence><sentence id="7612">Unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="7613">From the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> he made two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> what we had upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="7614">I went to see it when... there's no <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7615">From the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> he made an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7616">It's unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="7617">And he wanted to get out from it, the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="7618">But he had 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down?</sentence><sentence id="7619">How much?</sentence><sentence id="7620">I don't know how many thousands he had to put down when we made the agreement.</sentence><sentence id="7621">It was in the lawyers, collateral, you know.</sentence><sentence id="7622">And he wanted to, if he doesn't get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got the mortgage what he wanted.</sentence><sentence id="7623">The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted.</sentence><sentence id="7624">But he wanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to get out.</sentence><sentence id="7625">But then he would lose that money.</sentence><sentence id="7626">I think it was 25.</sentence><sentence id="7627">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="7628">Anyway.</sentence><sentence id="7629">And I was getting phone calls and it was a strange, strange accent, that I am going to come and kill you.</sentence><sentence id="7630">So then I said, "My God, I want to get out as early as can from here."</sentence><sentence id="7631">You know?</sentence><sentence id="7632">I think they were those people, those Chinese, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="7633">Then I was very afraid.</sentence><sentence id="7634">Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed.</sentence><sentence id="7635">So I slept, not in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we were one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, second <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, we were robbed.</sentence><sentence id="7636">But that's why we bought the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we went out from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7637">But otherwise, otherwise I didn't have that fear.</sentence><sentence id="7638">I didn't go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subways</span>, I was driving.</sentence><sentence id="7639">And it was very dangerous already, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="7640">So it was a <span class="DLF">parking lot</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I paid parking.</sentence><sentence id="7641">And I just ran to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7642">It was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="7643">I got out at the last minute really, because if you walked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> itself, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span>, and you had a necklace on or something, people from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> came and they took it off.</sentence><sentence id="7644">So it was a very dangerous <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7645">And it is very interesting that every <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, it is in a bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="7646">It is very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="7647">Even Flowers (ph), <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>, my God, my husband was operated, spine operation and I went to visit him with George.</sentence><sentence id="7648">Behind it there were big <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and we had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7649">And they were throwing bottles against us.</sentence><sentence id="7650">That was the best <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the name Flower, <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7651">Can you imagine?</sentence><sentence id="7652">That was years ago.</sentence><sentence id="7653">Stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlem</span>, or no.</sentence><sentence id="7654">So, we came here.</sentence><sentence id="7655">What I was seeing today on the television show, it's really scary, about five black guys, who are thieves.</sentence><sentence id="7656">And that show is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and how they are stealing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and how they are just bumping into people's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7657">And then innocent women, they get out, what happened.</sentence><sentence id="7658">And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> behind them and they take that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because it's a better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> than theirs.</sentence><sentence id="7659">There were five of them.</sentence><sentence id="7660">Can you imagine that?</sentence><sentence id="7661">I don't know how they can say it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> this way.</sentence><sentence id="7662">And there was a detective there, too.</sentence><sentence id="7663">And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it and they are selling it.</sentence><sentence id="7664">And she said, "How much you get for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="7665">She says, "We sell it for</sentence><sentence id="7667"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.478*0005 His) parts, 500 dollars.</sentence><sentence id="7668">And if it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span>, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars."</sentence><sentence id="7669">This is, this is, now again a more dangerous life since I came.</sentence><sentence id="7670">They were stealing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, of course they were stealing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, but that way I didn't hear it, never, when I was living there.</sentence><sentence id="7671">So it's now 13 years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
