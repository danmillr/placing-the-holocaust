<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: What language did your family speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: We s -- our mother language was Jewish, but we spoke several languages.</sentence><sentence id="61">Is -- my father was perfect in German, in fact he was teaching German and so we spoke Jewish, we knew German, Czech.</sentence><sentence id="62">And then when the Hungarian occupied us, I really had to make a crash course, learning very quickly Hungarian, which I did for just to survive, because if I went to hide, I had to know the language.</sentence><sentence id="63">And being I was so young and I had -- I really had an aptitude to learn quickly languages and I learned it within a few months.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you attend, did you attend <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="73"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0012 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: No, Czech, Czech.</sentence><sentence id="75">There was Jewi -- there was no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, there was only, if -- if you wanted to privately then you -- you went to, you know, like for people [inaudible] have to learn how to -- how to pray, but that was not in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">We had just <span class="BUILDING">Czech schools</span> and also Russian, because in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there lived a -- a great many, they were U-Ukrainians lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they lived mostly in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, not in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">So they had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for them also and there were some children that preferred to go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">They had a choice, to go either to that -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: Was there a significant Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="89">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was about, I would say -- we -- we were -- it was only about 12,000 occupants and approximately I would say that 50 percent were Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Was there harmony between Jews and non-Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, would you say, before the war began?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Th-Th-The Czechs were very liberal and we had no anti-Semitism as far as the Czechs were concerned, but the Ukrainians were anti-Semitic, however they had absolutely no power, because they were not in power.</sentence><sentence id="95">The Czech government was in power, so there was, I would say there was pretty much what you would say, harmony.</sentence><sentence id="96">We were not usually great, I mean we did not socialize a lot, but on -- just on friendly basis, to say hello.</sentence><sentence id="97">But it - - somehow it was that Jews were mostly socializing with Jews and it was also, you know, they did not care too much for education, where we are very education minded.</sentence><sentence id="98">So there would have been also a <span class="DLF">gap</span>, as far as on an intellectual level.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Did that change -- did the harmony between Jews and non-Jews change after the Hungarian occupation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="109"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0012 4</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: It -- as soon as the Hungarian occupied us, they implemented the same laws what the -- what the Nazis did.</sentence><sentence id="111">So when they -- before -- before their occupation, the Ukrainian took over because the -- the Czechs had left, they -- they -- there was no Czech government any more and th-they -- so we were really in peril, because they were going to kill all the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">And -- so we were really very glad when the Hungarians came in because we thought that they are much more civilized and much more organized government, but we found out very soon that this was not the case.</sentence><sentence id="113">My father was born in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but he was only two years when we came -- when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> and he had Czech citizenships.</sentence><sentence id="114">They took away our Czech citizenship and eventually, a few months later, when I went to <span class="BUILDING">Plata frip</span> -- no, before that.</sentence><sentence id="115">As soon as the Hungarian came in -- I was 14 y -- not even quite 14, but -- but close to 14 and I was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, of course and I didn't even finish the eighth grade, because I was -- in the eighth grade it was like -- like here a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, because our level of education was always very, very high.</sentence><sentence id="116">Let's say if you had <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, then it would be here -- like here two years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">Because we -- this is how they taught, because we didn't have like <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and right by us -- right after <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, you -- after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, you could go into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">Like my brothers.</sentence><sentence id="119">They studied, one studied law, one studied a <span class="BUILDING">dentistry</span>, but it was right after they finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">They didn't have to go first four years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then four years to become a dentist or four years of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and three years to become a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="121">From as soon as we graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, you could go in right straight to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> or to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">But then we -- I was -- all the Jewish children were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as soon as the Hungarian came in and we were sent out, they sent me -- we could not return to <span class="BUILDING">classes</span> the next day, so -- so of course we had nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="123">So one day I went</sentence><sentence id="125"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0012 5 to play to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when I came back, m-my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> was open and my mother and my sister Mina were gone.</sentence><sentence id="126">And we had three tenants in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they came to tell me that they were taken away by the police because they had no -- they took away their citizenship paper, so they were considered as aliens and -- and they -- and I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, but my mother motioned to me I shouldn't come near, because she didn't want me to be arrested too.</sentence><sentence id="127">And there was already my brother's friend, who was a lawyer and he came over to me an-and he told me -- he bent down with me and he told me I sh -- because I wanted to go right away with my mother, I was very attached to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="128">Told me if I'll be on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I'll be able to -- to help more and -- and I -- by then I had a married sister, so I really had this -- who to stay.</sentence><sentence id="129">And -- an-and -- and so they will take th -- away and I remained alone, for the -- at the age of 14.</sentence><sentence id="130">But eventually, my mother got and my sister, a six months extension.</sentence><sentence id="131">And this is -- when they came back, we had to make plans to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> because in six months they would -- they were the only ones really to get that extension, all the other people that were arrested at that time, when my mother and sister, they were taken over the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>, after a few months being kept ch -- in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">And most of them got killed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Were you particularly close with any of your brothers or sisters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: We were very, very close.</sentence><sentence id="235">In fact my brother was almost to me -- he took over, actually, the duties of our father because I was only nine years old and my father had passed away.</sentence><sentence id="236">And he -- he arranged that eventually I was going to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> when I finish the eighth grade, because after eighth grade, you had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yasinna</span> because there was no higher education.</sentence><sentence id="237">So y-you had to go -- go to a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for -- we called the <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span>, which was you know, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">And he -- he was always bringing me presents and we were -- we were a very, very closeknit family and very devoted.</sentence><sentence id="239">I will show you how devoted my brothers were, that Haim, he had also a chance to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because he was also, he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and after that he went on a hackshara, which was a -- you know, this was like a place where you were trained in -- in toiling the <span class="REGION">land</span> and -- and preparing yourself to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where you will be able to help build the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he had a -- and because he was a farshara, so he got a certificate to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, but in-instead he c -- he -- and -- but he came to say good-bye to us and then he came, he decided not to leave because he thought he'll be able to help us and he didn't want to leave</sentence><sentence id="241">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 8 us alone, so he stayed and -- and this is why he paid with his life, because he wanted to help his mother and sisters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: And it was Haim who you were saying was so helpful with -- with you, becoming like another father after your father had died?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: I-It -- It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Menachim</span> and father, Menachim did also everything but in fact, Menachim all these years, was so unhappy because he felt that he should have been there for us and -- and I kept alway -- I always had to -- had to tell him that this was the greatest thing that could have happened, because if -- if not he would have also perhaps perished and this way at least we had a-another family member survive.</sentence><sentence id="255">But he felt guilty all these years and he didn't know himself how -- how to help us after the war.</sentence><sentence id="256">My -- my brothers and sisters and my mother, they were the whole world to me.</sentence><sentence id="257">There was no better people on this earth that -- that I know, even -- for instance, Mina lives in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but we see each other twice a year, because I go there every year and when I come back, she -- I-I take her with me and we always -- i-if-if one didn't have, we always shared everything.</sentence><sentence id="258">While my husband was alive, whatever he bought me and if -- if they couldn't afford, he would always buy for my sister, because he knew it meant so much for me to enjoy it if she had it also.</sentence><sentence id="259">And we remained like this, very devoted to each other.</sentence><sentence id="260">And therefore, I d-d -- by having my family killed, they really destroyed my life also, because even -- even when you live and when you and -- and when you have already everything, but we could never fully enjoy anything, because we -- we lost so much in our lives and -- and we could never -- you can never get back.</sentence><sentence id="261">Can get back material things, but you simply cannot get back family and -- and it wasn't only the family, it was to -- to watch the terrible things that were done while we were incarcerated and to see people being killed so senselessly.</sentence><sentence id="262">It -- it remains with you</sentence><sentence id="264"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0012 9 the rest of your life.</sentence><sentence id="265">The nightmares never go away.</sentence><sentence id="266">The screams never fade in your mind and the nights are the ones that bring everything back to us, to all the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="267">I think when I speak, I speak for all the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="268">There isn't one survivor that is really a healthy person.</sentence><sentence id="269">But we have always lived our li-life decent.</sentence><sentence id="270">We never went out to murder just because we were murdered.</sentence><sentence id="271">We never became -- be-became criminals, just because such criminal acts were done to us.</sentence><sentence id="272">We brought our children up with values, with love and with respect for all humanity, for all races and because we know what it means to be a bigot.</sentence><sentence id="273">And though it still today, much hasn't changed, there are people that have the audacity to deny that this ever happened.</sentence><sentence id="274">We, as survivors can render them liars, because we are here as witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="275">We are the proof of those atrocities that were committed.</sentence><sentence id="276">And all our loved ones, they're not here to talk about it, but we are and though it is very painful for us to go back and to open our wounds, we're willing to do it, for the sake of future generations and history, so that our voices will be heard and those liars will be -- will be put to shame, that they can yet not even repent that was done to us.</sentence><sentence id="277">Because these are the people that would do it all over again, so unless they are going to be somehow silenced and unless all of the generations that will come after us, will be able to prove with our testimonies that this really happened, there will be many books written that people eventually will believe it because how -- how -- how would they otherwise know what a w -- that it wasn't, that it was different than what they are reading to the books?</sentence><sentence id="278">So I'm very pleased now that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> are finally having programs and that they are teaching us, because for the first 35 years it was utter silence.</sentence><sentence id="279">Nobody even knew anything about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="280">And if somebody in the movies, the -- the books that were written, read by us, will vouch by us.</sentence><sentence id="281">I-I remember that people would tell me that -- all weekend, it's too painful, we cannot go to see -- that's if they</sentence><sentence id="283">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 10 made the Holocaust movie or we cannot read those book, it -- it's -- it's makes us very sad.</sentence><sentence id="284">It would be very upsetting to me to hear that, because if we could go through what we did, what we had to go through, then can't you at least watch it, can't you at least familiarize yourself?</sentence><sentence id="285">We couldn't even talk about it because -- because it was so painful to us and because we had to rebuild our lives and because we wanted to have a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="286">As mu -- as much as we could have a normal life ourselves, but people don't even feel like to -- to know about it.</sentence><sentence id="287">So finally, they have now <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust memorials</span> that -- that people can take their children to -- to show what -- what bessiality was conducted on human beings.</sentence><sentence id="288">And what can I add to this except that -- that we hope that this will never happen again and if you have any questions that would like, you

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: We were always traditional Jews, but not religious Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2294">We did keep holidays, an -- but we did not keep all the dietary laws.</sentence><sentence id="2295">We did not keep the, you know that I traveled on -- on Shabbat when -- whoever is religious, does not do these things, but I always had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, but <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I was not observing what I ate.</sentence><sentence id="2296">Then my husband -- w-we -- we had -- we moved a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> and then we changed <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to -- to a nicer <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span>, because my husband wanted very much to live there.</sentence><sentence id="2297">So we moved and -- and after, about -- we didn't even live there a year, my husband got cancer and -- and he didn't have very long to live.</sentence><sentence id="2298">My son David, we -- was -- was already danear religious, because we sent my children, all of my children, we sent to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, like David went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2299">My oldest son Peter went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span>, but Peter didn't like Yeshiva and -- and didn't remain religious, he didn't keep anything, but we wanted to give our children the choice, that they should be able, if -- if they want to be religious and my husband went also to a Yeshiva when he was young and we wanted them to have the same education and then whatever they do with their, you know, whatever they do, we can't always control.</sentence><sentence id="2300">So my son David, he loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> and he became religious right from the beginning, as soon as he started at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2301">And this the -- full time day school, where they have both, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Half a year -- half a day is devoted to religion and a half a day is to secular studies.</sentence><sentence id="2303">And when my h-husband got very sick, my son David, he used to go to rabbi's, to -- you know, they should pr-pray for him and asked his -- ask-asked my son whether his parents are religious and he said, "They are not."</sentence><sentence id="2304">So h-he told him that maybe God would help if -- if the parents became religious, Shomu Shabbat.</sentence><sentence id="2305">Shomu Shabbat means that you keep -- you</sentence><sentence id="2307">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 76 keep the Sabbath, you -- because there are degrees of religion -- there is very religious and very religious, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2308">Amada religiouson.</sentence><sentence id="2309">So when David came back, my husband was already very sick and -- and he wasn't going to -- and I told him not to bother my husband, you know, because if he's religious, on -- on the hol-holidays, not allowed to watch television, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2310">I wanted him to be able to occupy, you know, not to think always about his sickness.</sentence><sentence id="2311">So David told me what the rabbi said, and he said, "You know, why don't you become religious, maybe this will help Dad."</sentence><sentence id="2312">And they are very, very close to their father and they loved him very much and -- and I loved him very much, but I knew there is no hope.</sentence><sentence id="2313">But I didn't want that my son should ever think for one day that I didn't try to help his father -- to save his father.</sentence><sentence id="2314">If he believes so much that -- in the rabbi's, that Hallechin is going to help his father, I didn't want that when Joe will die that David should ever think once, you know, if his mother would have become religious, maybe his father would have lived, or would have lived longer.</sentence><sentence id="2315">I told David, if -- if this will help your father, I'm going to become religious, I'm going to keep everything.</sentence><sentence id="2316">Unfortunately, I don't -- we have to be prepared, because I didn't want him to be so disappointed, because I knew what the score is.</sentence><sentence id="2317">I said, "But I am going to -- you can rely on me, I'm promising you, I'll become religious."</sentence><sentence id="2318">And this is how it was, this is how I turn back to -- to observing the Sabbath and outside I don't eat, ever, a-anything that's not kosher.</sentence><sentence id="2319">I-I travel a lot, even now, but I only eat always fish and you know, salad, baked potato.</sentence><sentence id="2320">Wherever we are, when we are not ina <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2321">And my son became always more and more religious.</sentence><sentence id="2322">This is how -- how he is happy in his life and religion really helped a great deal for me, in a way -- that my son was religious because his father died when he just entered <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, it was his first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and though he wanted to go away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, but because his father died, so he didn't</sentence><sentence id="2324">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0012 77 want me to be alone, so he stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he went to <span class="BUILDING">Queen's College</span>, instead of going away, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2325">And -- and he was the one, the strong one in the family when -- when this - - when the de -- when my fa -- when my husband passed away.</sentence><sentence id="2326">Because my daughter got sick after his death and my older son could not accept it.</sentence><sentence id="2327">David was the only one, the strong one and the one that -- that accepted it and that he always felt that there is a reason for everything, whatever God does and he was the one that could -- th-that could give courage to my other children and -- and he wrote such a beautiful letter to my daughter that she keeps it to this day, because he wrote her that, first of all he would -- he -- he believed that if somebody who is -- cries too much and -- an-and is mourning so much for a -- for a loved one, that his soul can't rest in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2328">This is how he believes.</sentence><sentence id="2329">So he wrote, he told me once, "Mom, you loved Dad so much, then you have to want to give him also, peace in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2330">Y- You can't -- you have to accept and -- and you have to go on with your life and -- and -- and -- and you cannot keep mourning all the day and night.</sentence><sentence id="2331">You must -- you must do that for Dad."</sentence><sentence id="2332">I-I wish I could feel the same way my son feels, but -- but I don't, but I -- I observe whatever i-is possible, as far as I can observe.</sentence><sentence id="2333">But what he wrote to -- to my daughter is -- is -- L really want to show his -- h-h-how a religious person can help others who are not religious.</sentence><sentence id="2334">And he -- and how he can accept the unac -- the unacceptable, like it was unacceptable for my older children.</sentence><sentence id="2335">He wrote her, to his sister, "Dear Rene, look how much more you had in life because of Daddy, than me.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Daddy was there for you

change what -- what God designate for each person, but Dad always told us --" and this is really what he told the family always, "I'm not afraid to die, I had a wonderful life and a wonderful marriage and -- and I -- " he was 63 years old, "and after all, some people live 80 years and they have a miserable marriage or they have no children or they have children that are -- that are in <span

like that or to feel like that and to think like that.</sentence><sentence id="2346">And -- and I could have had a lot of problems if it would be not a religious child because he could have been a
