<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you tell us your name and where and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Masha Loen.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>, 1930.</sentence><sentence id="7">I lived near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Slobodka</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="8">I came from an average <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">In Yiddish they would say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balle Batish</span>, middle class.</sentence><sentence id="10">My father was a good tailor, maybe would have called a designer here and made a good living and I had two little sisters and one older sister than I am.</sentence><sentence id="11">We were four girls.</sentence><sentence id="12">One of them was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">There was only three girls before the war, and no boys.</sentence><sentence id="14">And what I can tell about my childhood...I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">I went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, called <span class="BUILDING">Kommerz Gymnasium</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="16">I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">It so happened that I I have a terrible temper and the teacher said something to me and I didn't like it and I took the my book and I threw at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">On accident I think it hit her nose.</sentence><sentence id="19">So my grandfather pushed me into a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> somehow and I enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="20">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> everyday by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">We came back.</sentence><sentence id="22">We came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">We played games.</sentence><sentence id="24">We played soccer ball they called in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and we made Jewish friends mostly and in the winter we were ice skating.</sentence><sentence id="25">That was the main sport of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in the winter for kids and grown-ups too, and like I said, everything was going on just as it is till 1940, when the Russians came in first to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">They gave us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, the capital back and at that time when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>, a lot...we had some refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> so they came and we helped them with clothes and everything else and I had a Austrian little girl friend by the name of Levine, Anna Levine.</sentence><sentence id="27">I will never forget that and I came to my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="28">My grandfather was better off than we were and I said, Zayde, I need a bicyclet, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for my girlfriend Anna.</sentence><sentence id="29">He said you know, Maraska (ph), I can't afford to buy her a new one but we'll manage something, and you know, he found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and put on a net in the back, and matched mine...very so much that I liked hers better than mine, and she was a beautiful girl.</sentence><sentence id="30">A very well-behaved child.</sentence><sentence id="31">My mother loved her very much because she thought it was good influence on me and I don't know what happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="32">I absolute don't know.</sentence><sentence id="33">I lost touch with her when I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because I had so much on my mind.</sentence><sentence id="34">When the war broke up in 1941, my sister, my oldest sister that is four and a half years older than I am, was a Communist, and she somehow came to us and she said run, 01:04: because I'm running.</sentence><sentence id="35">And she disappeared and we packed up whatever we could and we ran.</sentence><sentence id="36">My little sister was, , the little...the youngest, was about six years, seven years younger than I am and we start running and before we even reached about twenty, thirty kilometers...the Germans were ahead of us, and my grandmother was running and my uncle was running, and my uncle at one time was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Memel</span> that was occupied by the Germans and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> and he said, we have to get away.</sentence><sentence id="37">We cannot stay.</sentence><sentence id="38">So we were running, but the running didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="39">They overtook us, so we snuck very quietly back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> and I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Slobodka</span> and what I can tell you is it it happened to me I an experience today that with that .</sentence><sentence id="40">I, we walked into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everything was like blood lying all over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">Nobody was killed because nobody was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">I don't know how the blood get got there and then the neighbors all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>... many many Jews got killed.</sentence><sentence id="43">In fact later on I heard from the grown-ups accidentally there was there was a head from the child and a breast from the mother standing on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> because the Lithuanians said the pogrom before the Germans even came in, and today of all days I met a righteous Lithuanian woman and admired her more than anybody else that from so many murderers like the Lithuanians, one woman could come out and hide a one and a half year old child.</sentence><sentence id="44">I don't know if she got paid for it or what happened.</sentence><sentence id="45">I didn't want to ask questions but I did ask her and I feel badly.</sentence><sentence id="46">Maybe I hurt her, if she had more problems from her neighbors than from the Nazis, because the Lithuanians, like I said, were very very bad.</sentence><sentence id="47">They collaborated with the Germans in every way and did a lot of things that the Germans didn't do and asked them to do to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="48">To find one that saved really a child is a miracle and I shouldn't have said it.</sentence><sentence id="49">I felt badly later on, because she answered, in every <span class="NPIP">nationality</span> and every <span class="NPIP">religion</span> are different kind of people.</sentence><sentence id="50">I wanted to tell her yes, but not so in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> but I already kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything because it happened as they said...there was the Riga Aktion, there was the Estonia Aktion.</sentence><sentence id="51">Every time they took out...first they killed a lot of...the first thing they killed is the intellectuals in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">So being a child I didn't know that, learned after the war, but what I remember is the Riga Aktion.</sentence><sentence id="53">I was working, as an older child.</sentence><sentence id="54">I was always acting like...when the war started I was not going on eleven...I was going on forty, because I had to grow up.</sentence><sentence id="55">I had to grow up because of the blood that they saw and the thing that was going on and here is my mother with two...with pregnant, expecting another child and I didn't know, you know, in which world Iam.</sentence><sentence id="56">Am I forty?Am | eleven?</sentence><sentence id="57">Am I fifteen?</sentence><sentence id="58">Sometimes I cried like a baby and sometimes I acted like a grown-up that nobody can touch me.</sentence><sentence id="59">I was untouchable, and what happened is is that my uncle, Menashke Saposhnikov, my father's brother, was one of the leaders of the underground and when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> ghet...and we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">It was in my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you went through a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baker's oven</span> and you went in there.</sentence><sentence id="61">In fact the underground some of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">equipment</span> kept in that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">They knew about the <span class="BUILDING">Kinder Aktion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">I walked at night in the <span class="BUILDING">ghetto Werkstatten</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, you know, what they did knitting and they did sewing and all different kind of things and they came to pick me up to run me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because they knew somehow, the underground knew there was going to be an Aktion and they are taking people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And as we get, as there was an Aktion...first it was the...no, I'm sorry, I have to go back...first there was the the Kleine Aktion.</sentence><sentence id="65">That was from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">There was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and they liquidated the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Then there was the aktion from one <span class="NPIP">section</span> where I lived and that time they took away my grandfather...both my grandfathers, both my grandmothers, uncles, aunts and so on and I tell you something - I could have saved them, but I came too late.</sentence><sentence id="68">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="69">The Kommandatur, the German command was not far from us and I had a little cousin...my uncle and aunt live now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>...it was their daughter,Dveirele, and she came in and she said: Tante Michle...German...poup, poup, poup.</sentence><sentence id="70">She saw those German near the Kommandatur, and she saw them with their rifles, whatever they had at that time - I don't remember, and my mother says, and she was, you know, the little flour that she had she was baking...it was a Friday...and she was scrubbing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and said get out 01:10: of my way, and all of a sudden in about ten minutes, the Germans came in with the shotguns and pushed us out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and at that time my father, like I said, he was a better tailor...worked for <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...at that time he was the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span>, and he was sewing for him and we got some sign [document] called the Lebensschein.</sentence><sentence id="71">And that is a sign to be alive and it was hanging in our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> and she yells to me, Maruska, go get the , the...to be alive...the Lebensschein.</sentence><sentence id="72">So I ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I grabbed the Schein and I come out and my mother wasn't there, and then there was a big <span class="DLF">street</span> that they took us to the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that <span class="DLF">street</span> was the <span class="DLF">border</span> how many people they took out, and there were people going by the dozens, carrying children and so on, and I want my mother, so I stand up in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I start yelling...this is why I tell you I grew up so fast...Momma, Momma, Momma...so a German start beating me and he said get off the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">I'll shoot you right there.</sentence><sentence id="74">I said no.</sentence><sentence id="75">I have Judenschein.</sentence><sentence id="76">You cannot shoot me, like I was something special.</sentence><sentence id="77">I thought I was something special.</sentence><sentence id="78">He says get off there and all of a sudden from about I don't know how many feet away to tell you...maybe a block away...I heard my mother's voice yelling Maruska, Maruska...and I run to her.</sentence><sentence id="79">When we came to that <span class="DLF">field</span> where they're they're separating...right, left, right, left...1 found out that one Judenschein can save one family, and I had four of them, because I had three from us and one for my father that was out to work in the brigade, so I kept running around between the people, but they already took away both my grandmothers and both my grandfathers.</sentence><sentence id="80">There were nobody left from my family that was living right there in that section, so what I did is I said Momma, what should I do.</sentence><sentence id="81">She said start grabbing people.</sentence><sentence id="82">Start giving them the Judenschein.</sentence><sentence id="83">My mother always thought of somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="84">She was a beautiful lady, not because she was my mother, but as I grow up and I don't think I'm that nice and people say I'm a nice person but I don't think so, because I don't, wouldn't have had the guts to tell my daughter to run around with life, life depends on and start grabbing people and giving them Judenschein and then you don't even know if you would get it back from them, but if people were nice enough when we came back on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span>, on the good <span class="NPIP">side</span>, they did give me back the Judenschein and this is one day part of my life, of my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="85">And that was the first aktion...that was the second one and then it was the Riga aktion.</sentence><sentence id="86">I couldn't tell you really one after another because I blank out or I may go back from time to time to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="87">Is that alright?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: That's fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: And then came the big Aktion, October 28th, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was...I don't know...I can't tell you dates really and that was called the Grosse Aktion, the big aktion.</sentence><sentence id="178">And they went from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they told everybody please leave your sick ones at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> wants to hold a speech.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">We want you on this and this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">Leave your sick ones <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everybody has to be at this and this time on that <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">So my mother was pregnant and one of my uncles that my aunt was taken away in the first aktion that I told you, had something very swollen on his face and we didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="182">He came with us.</sentence><sentence id="183">Some of my aunts were separated.</sentence><sentence id="184">My mother's sister that we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was separated from us, but my father's brother and my father's brother that was in the underground kept yelling at my father...he was a painter...and my father took him in and showed him how to sew and he worked with him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jordan Brigade</span> as a tailor, so we came and we came on that big <span class="DLF">field</span> and they start sorting and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> never showed up.</sentence><sentence id="185">They surrounded us with machine guns and they start sorting...right, left, right, left.</sentence><sentence id="186">And Hessel, I think it was Hessel his name - I don't know for sure - I can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="187">He was the right hand of <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">He comes up to my father and says you Bruder Schneidermeister, you brother tailor.</sentence><sentence id="189">Take your family and go.</sentence><sentence id="190">So my father started looking for people...you know for family, but there was no family around except my uncle with that big face and he said what's the matter with him.</sentence><sentence id="191">He says oh, he had a toothache.</sentence><sentence id="192">It will be pulled out, and my father saw that there's nobody from our family so he start dragging people that were behind and in front of us and my mother and me, and he had such a smirk on his face...I'll never forget...and they said all this is your family?</sentence><sentence id="193">And my father saved a lot of strangers and we all went and a lot of my aunts went away.</sentence><sentence id="194">A lot of people went away to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>, and what the most terrible thing about the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> is that at night we heard the shooting of the people.</sentence><sentence id="195">The machine guns were going "t-t-t-t-t-t-t" and what I found out...now these things what I'm going to tell you now I found out after the war...is that they were not shooting one person into the <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">They were shooting two or three at a time to save bullets and that were open <span class="DLF">graves</span> and then they would put a chemical over it and burn them, and some people after it got dark ten thousand people to shoot into the <span class="DLF">graves</span>, it took time, by the time they sorted us out and everything, so they didn't have a chance to burn them.</sentence><sentence id="197">Some of them got themselves out and came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and this is how we find out what had happened, so what they called portable <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> and they called portable <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>...that why when I talk about the Kovno ghetto I don't talk it as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">I talk it as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">I talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span> as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, because we did have <span class="BUILDING">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">We did have <span class="BUILDING">portable crematoriums</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">They didn't have to have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">They just shot them in.</sentence><sentence id="203">At that time they still had bullets.</sentence><sentence id="204">They shot them in and then burned them.</sentence><sentence id="205">So if they can call a <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span> why couldn't we call the <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">Do you think I'm wrong?</sentence><sentence id="207">So this is what I call...when I talk to some people where they ask me about experiences, I don't talk really like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is a concentration of certain people that, ethnic people and so on, and I don't call this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because being without food, being without clothes, being eliminated constantly, thousand, ten thousand, five thousand...and then buried practically alive in a <span class="BUILDING">portable crematorium</span>...you couldn't call this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">You called this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and then we were sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">Now I want to tell you one story that I always talk about and that's the children aktion.</sentence><sentence id="210">The children...1 was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works...everything happens that they, that should happen, like today I'm here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with a broken leg, but that's alright.</sentence><sentence id="211">Everything happens that should happen.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="212">I came to my father.</sentence><sentence id="213">You see the Jordan brigade, it was moved to the <span class="BUILDING">ghetto works</span> and my father was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">You know, you would trade some things for some food and the Jordan brigade, it was well-know that it was bringing food into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and would share.</sentence><sentence id="215">My mother of course shared it with with everybody before she gave it to us.</sentence><sentence id="216">My father shared it with his family.</sentence><sentence id="217">So you had food to eat, more than the average person, so what happened is when they put the Jordan brigade into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, they had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">They had a <span class="DLF">window</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and everything was...they had it better than anybody.</sentence><sentence id="219">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works but it still was not in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so that day in, very early in the morning, there's a .</sentence><sentence id="220">You know what...I would like to go out into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in a brigade I said maybe I can bring something in because it's getting to the point that the kids are starving, you know.</sentence><sentence id="221">And they said...not starving but not enough food to...you know, we did our best.</sentence><sentence id="222">And he said you know what...I said you have protection.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="223">You go in.</sentence><sentence id="224">You talk to the Arbeitsamt, to the Komitet in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works, so he went in and it was already late, and he said to me...that one of the men said, he says, you know, Herr Saposhnikov, he says, there is one brigade, a German and six girls to clean up a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...would you daughter be happy to do that?</sentence><sentence id="225">He said my daughter would be very happy to do it, so it happened that we left late and as we were walking out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...of course every girl was older than I was, that worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> works...we saw some black machines coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but no <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">Just painted little white <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And I said to the girls, oh, that looks funny.</sentence><sentence id="228">There's something rotten in Den...I didn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>...I was too young to know about, you know, Hamlet or whatever it is...and I said there's something wrong.</sentence><sentence id="229">Why are those machines coming in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">I a little panic, keep quiet...they're coming in...they're bringing some people maybe from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or something, so I kept quiet and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">German's house</span>, and we cleaned up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were six girls and we were six girls...they had two Germans watching us and the brigadier, the Jewish fellow that went with us, so there was no way of us going out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trade something for bread or milk or things like that, so what happened is that I ......how long does it take to clean up a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, as even if you're weak and don't eat all day and everything.</sentence><sentence id="231">Still it doesn't take long.</sentence><sentence id="232">Six girls.</sentence><sentence id="233">So what we did is we didn't know what to do...we start dancing and singing and dancing the horah and | never danced the horah in my life, but it was some older people and they knew about the horah and they start dancing the horah so the Germans walk in and said, you're through?</sentence><sentence id="234">It's time to take you back.</sentence><sentence id="235">Fine.</sentence><sentence id="236">We couldn't trade anyways so something to bring in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so they took us back and that Lithuanian woman was wrong

part of her valuables that was left over, and the middle one, the one that was younger than I, we put her hair up, we put lipstick and we put her between me and my father and my mother in front, and we slipped through because we were not far, like I told you, for the German Kommandatur.</sentence><sentence id="350">So what happened is every time they made the <span

believe it.</sentence><sentence id="367">Nobody...a lot of Americans don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="368">A lot of people of the free world don't believe it, so...because she was so good

they were burning the <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> so I covered myself with the straw and I slipped into unconsciousness and when I woke up, I woke up in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that the Russians are taking care of me medically, and before I even have a chance to breath properly, they told us they have to move out of there.</sentence><sentence id="547">The front is coming

drin...eat a part of it.</sentence><sentence id="554">Said I'll eat it too, and we both fell asleep and we got up and we felt better.</sentence><sentence id="555">Now I realized that it must have been fermented, and we both got drunk on it, on those black berries and we fall asleep and maybe that's what helped knock down with all the medication that we got, and they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">Russian hospital</span> and they shaved our head, because it was all full of thing.</sentence><sentence id="556">They put a green solvent, and you can imagine...I was forty-five kilo

going on the front.</sentence><sentence id="561">They didn't give a damn who it was.</sentence><sentence id="562">So and then you had to sign typhus...they didn't even listen, so what they did is they gave me a little bottle of medicine that the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> gave me, and every time a drunk Russian, no matter how drunk he was, came in or something, they send me out with my all that green stuff on my head and like this and I walked out like a dead woman, and when they saw me coming they start running.</sentence><sentence id="563">But then my hair start growing in and I start getting a little better, they said no.</sentence><sentence id="564">We can't stand it anymore, so we went to the Russian commandanteur and at that time I didn't give them no . [</sentence><sentence id="565">just wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see if anybody's alive.</sentence><sentence id="566">And we went to the Russian.</sentence><sentence id="567">They said oh yes, we'll send you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they sent us to <span class="DLF">farms</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span>, and there's a story by itself.</sentence><sentence id="568">We arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span> and there's cows, sick cows and sick pigs and sick things, you know, and they want, needed food for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> so what they did is they opened a <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span>, where they couldn't use the cows and they didn't know what to do with it, so the Russian girls that went...Ukrainian Russian girl... I thought that went the Germans were playing the piano and the Jewish girls were cleaning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stalls</span> from the cows, everything.</sentence><sentence id="569">After the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and after what they went through so in one time it comes, the captain comes to us.</sentence><sentence id="570">He says who wants to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rickenwald</span> (ph).There is a veterinarian doctor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and he wants to teach you to be a veterinarian nurse.</sentence><sentence id="571">In two weeks he wants to teach us to be a veterinarian nurse, so I am game.</sentence><sentence id="572">I'm game of anything.</sentence><sentence id="573">I said I'm going.</sentence><sentence id="574">I mean, there we were also kept like in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> but not as bad because we had food, we had clothes, everything, but we could never walk from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to another without a Russian soldier.</sentence><sentence id="575">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rickenwald</span> and it so happened...I must read (ph) of my father and I told the Polkovniks [colonel]wife, I said you know, you don't wear this dress.</sentence><sentence id="576">This is a nightgown.</sentence><sentence id="577">Put on this.</sentence><sentence id="578">I said you have so much clothes and I told her all the hair, you should do it, you know, that way.</sentence><sentence id="579">I made very good friends with her, and the doctor that was supposed to teach us was a drunkard.</sentence><sentence id="580">Was very sick, very drunk, so he would teach us about two hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="581">The rest of the time he would get drunk and after two weeks, he gave us a big stamp.</sentence><sentence id="582">He said, , I'm a veterinarian nurse.</sentence><sentence id="583">So I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and 6 they put...Polkovnik came to visit one time...this is during the Russian.</sentence><sentence id="584">This, I'm liberated

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">My wife wants to talk to her.</sentence><sentence id="590">So he saw that I am good friends with Polkovnik and the Russian soldiers loved me very much because I worked where the milk was delivered and were going to the <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span>, so the Russian soldiers wouldn't get anything to eat, and when we came back, what they did is what they did with the cows that they captured, we checked if they have tuberculosis and we would cut around the lungs...would have the German people cut around the lungs and then the rest they would cut, cook it for the Russian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="591">The good ones they would make <span class="BUILDING">conserves</span> themselves.</sentence><sentence id="592">They opened a <span class="BUILDING">conserve factory</span> and send it to Russian and so the cheese, the Russian soldiers didn't get nothing, so they would come at twelve o'clock at night and I would give them the milk and I would give them whatever there was.</sentence><sentence id="593">The captain had everything at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, but the soldier had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="594">So they liked me very much.</sentence><sentence id="595">And Polkovnik liked me, so how does he get rid of me.</sentence><sentence id="596">He makes me...now remember, this is "45 and it was beginning of "45 when I was liberated and went though it.</sentence><sentence id="597">Let's say I was fifteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="598">I wasn't even fifteen years old, and they send me as the head of the <span class="BUILDING">cheese factory</span>, and they send and a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I get the <span

going to take revenge.</sentence><sentence id="599">I'm going to take revenge of the people, so I was riding a horse, being that I was a veterinarian nurse I had to go to the <span

and I was careful not to hurt them, but I thought I had and I walked into a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> and I would, with my boot I was always opening like they did our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and you know after four weeks what I did.</sentence><sentence id="600">I stole from the Russians and I gave the medicine, because we Jewish people are compassionate

all I knew is how to take analysis, a blood analysis from a horse, and somebody had to hold him, and how to cut around the lungs from the cow, and how to see that everybody, that everything is clean.</sentence><sentence id="674">And when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riegenwald</span> after the polkovnik was there, in about a period of three weeks, the Jewish girls are playing the piano and the Russian girls were cleaning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stalls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">But I was in danger from them also.</sentence><sentence id="676">So I had to run away somehow, so my father found out where I was from somebody and he sent that man to get me out of there, and this is how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, because my father survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="677">And then we had to go

is we had to smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="687">So how do we smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="688">It costs a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="689">So Masha went to work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and made friends with the Brichah and took a
