<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="444">A: You bet they were good soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="445">And when they were shooting those guns, they were dead shots, too.</sentence><sentence id="446">Now I had one shooting at me with a machine gun, cause we ran a--he-here's the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="447">I don't know whether you know any -- you know how ya -- how the army when they're -- when you're tra -- going into a battle like, well, we're go -- we're going along, coming up -- up through this <span class="DLF">field</span> that, and someone says that -- that the Germans are up ahead somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="448">Well, we always had scouts out, two scouts.</sentence><sentence id="449">They'd be about oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us.</sentence><sentence id="450">Now, they were not supposed to shoot any bra -- any Germans that they seen, but they were supposed to give us the silent signal.</sentence><sentence id="451">The silent signal was a -- y-you laid your rifle down, you grabbed ahold of it and -- by the barrel and by the -- and by the back</sentence><sentence id="453">Interview with Grant Shultheis 15 October 8, 2010 of it, and you put it above your head and go like that.</sentence><sentence id="454">That is your signal that the enemy was there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="467">Q: An up and down movement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="469">A: Yes, they -- and they -- and they didn't make a sound.</sentence><sentence id="470">Well, anyhow, then wh- when we got that message, by boy they just -- they blew a whistle and we just spread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a <span class="DLF">trap</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">And so the Germans, they smartened up.</sentence><sentence id="472">They thought by us cat -- by us having those two scouts there, they were told tr -- told, do not shoot the scouts.</sentence><sentence id="473">Th- The German did.</sentence><sentence id="474">He says, wait til they get through your <span class="DLF">lines</span>, but make sure they don't see you to give out and give the -- us the -- the warning.</sentence><sentence id="475">Says go, and -- wait a minute now, I think of something about that -- anyhow, he says, let them go through your ra-ranks, but make sure they don't see you.</sentence><sentence id="476">And then, when they get through it, grab them, and then we'll put them in -- in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, then, for the -- you know, the -- the -- the ten -- well, anyhow, the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="477">And so anyway, that's what they did, cause we lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our shells went and blew the <span class="DLF">fence</span> down, and wa -- th-then they shot out of it, and they got back with us again.</sentence><sentence id="478">And they said that when they were -- the Germans ran, he says, we ran right with them.</sentence><sentence id="479">He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting at us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed.</sentence><sentence id="480">So anyhow they -- the scouts, we ha -- we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would -- we would</sentence></p><p><sentence id="483">Interview with Grant Shultheis 16 October 8, 2010 -- see, we'd be going in the single file, maybe might be three or four in a row, you know how they are when you're marching.</sentence><sentence id="484">And as soon we got that signal boy, you s -- just spread right out.</sentence><sentence id="485">And everybody got their -- we had little shovels.</sentence><sentence id="486">You probably sm -- maybe you seen them already.</sentence><sentence id="487">And we'd dig a <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> and get down in under below the ground surface.</sentence><sentence id="488">And then that -- then the -- we were ready for fight then.</sentence><sentence id="489">But if you -- if we didn't see that signal, why we would walk right into this trap.</sentence><sentence id="490">Now, we ran into one of them <span class="DLF">traps</span>, and all of a sudden they start shooting.</sentence><sentence id="491">And I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> right where I was, you -- whenever -- when they start shooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick, because you want to live a little longer.</sentence><sentence id="492">So anyhow, we went and -- wait a minute now.</sentence><sentence id="493">We -- well, we -- we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us, and we got down and then we start shooting back.</sentence><sentence id="494">Well, I was out, right out in the open <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="495">Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was reloading mine.</sentence><sentence id="496">And when I was shooting <span class="DLF">mine</span>, he was reloading his.</sentence><sentence id="497">So we had a steady sho -- stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were.</sentence><sentence id="498">So anyhow, they went out and he -- he turns on me.</sentence><sentence id="499">I was laying down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> shooting there, and I didn't have no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> or nothing to get behind, I was out in the open.</sentence><sentence id="500">And my buddy, he -- he got the only <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> that was there, he -- he dove behind it.</sentence><sentence id="501">Anyway, and the Germans saw me.</sentence><sentence id="502">So he turns the machine gun on me.</sentence><sentence id="503">Now, he [indecipherable] like, well, we'll just -- there, there.</sentence><sentence id="504">We'll just say here</sentence><sentence id="506">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tare blormatoeraboutfisonecion</sentence></p><p><sentence id="507">Interview with Grant Shultheis 17 October 8, 2010</sentence></p><p><sentence id="508">[indecipherable] right here.</sentence><sentence id="509">I stretched out this way, see, and up -- the Germans are up that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my body.</sentence><sentence id="510">He dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span>, a <span class="DLF">trench</span> with that machine gun, from my head down to my feet, about four inches deep with those bullets.</sentence><sentence id="511">That's -- an-and I was laying right there, all that dirt was flying in my face and all over my body and that.</sentence><sentence id="512">And I was trying to crawl <span class="NPIP">inside</span> of my helmet, but I wasn't do -- doing good.</sentence><sentence id="513">My head was already in there.</sentence><sentence id="514">So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he'd think he killed me, and he" ll go and shoot somebo -- at somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="515">So whenever he stopped -- he had to stop and reload, you know, and when he'd run out of shells, why he'd take a couple of minutes for him to get the new belts i-in there of shells.</sentence><sentence id="516">Well, while he was doing that, I was lay -- laying there figuring out what I was going to do to him.</sentence><sentence id="517">Anyhow, I had dirt and mud and everything in my face, and all over my body and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="518">The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud, you might say.</sentence><sentence id="519">So anyway, I -- I got a-- while -- while he was shooting, h-he to -- he change his -- his targets then.</sentence><sentence id="520">He looked for somebody that was -- he could see, cause he saw me laying there and he figured he'd killed me, see?</sentence><sentence id="521">Well, that worked.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="522">Anyhow, he starts shooting at somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="523">Now, when he starts shooting at somebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades.</sentence><sentence id="524">The captain come out to me when we -- fe -- before we started out that day and he says, Shultheis.</sentence><sentence id="525">I said, yes sir?</sentence><sentence id="526">He says, you're my grenadier.</sentence><sentence id="527">I said, yes, sir, I said, sir.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="530">Interview with Grant Shultheis 18 October 8, 2010</sentence></p><p><sentence id="531">He says, yeah, what do you want?</sentence><sentence id="532">He said -- I said, what's a grenadier?</sentence><sentence id="533">He ha -- he said, you're the guy to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="534">So I pulled one -- I pulled out the gre-grenade, he gave me a ba --a pa --a bag like, see, I would call it a bag.</sentence><sentence id="535">Anyhow, it fit over your shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three exp! --</sentence><sentence id="536">high e-explosion.</sentence><sentence id="537">So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these?</sentence><sentence id="538">He says, you're supposed to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="539">I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you think that this little thing here is going to stop one of them great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>?</sentence><sentence id="540">He says, I know it will.</sentence><sentence id="541">I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>?</sentence><sentence id="542">And he says, the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">Now, I never knew this before that -- before that day.</sentence><sentence id="544">He says I -- when the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> are gone, there's a -- a little <span class="DLF">track</span> in the center of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, and it -- and it runs -- it keeps those su -- tracks on the wheels like, even, so that they don't come off.</sentence><sentence id="545">And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it's about that big, he said.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="546">But that's like telling you to go jump in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="547">Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I think we can stop them all right then, if we can -- if I can hit that -- if I can just hit that there part where you just told me.</sentence><sentence id="548">And so anyhow, he s -- he -- he agreed with me on it.</sentence><sentence id="549">So he went and let me figure it out myself.</sentence><sentence id="550">So -- but I-- I never saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> after that.</sentence><sentence id="551">S -- but I did use them on -- on machine guns, and boy it worked good.</sentence><sentence id="552">So anyway, this one whose -- this machine gunner that was shooting at me, I th--I thought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th -- that he'1I think he killed me, because he was pretty far away, you know.</sentence><sentence id="553">So, by gollies, it worked.</sentence><sentence id="554">I laid still and</sentence><sentence id="556">Interview with Grant Shultheis 19 October 8, 2010</sentence></p><p><sentence id="557">he sh -- quit shooting at me.</sentence><sentence id="558">I guess he must have stop -- must have ran out of shells and he had to put another belt on, and while he was putting that belt on, 1---I-I rigged up my -- my grenade launcher on my rifle, and you shoot those grenades with a blank.</sentence><sentence id="559">So they told me, they says, for God's sakes, make sure you don't have a live round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with a live round, you're gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that -- that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was and knock your head off.</sentence><sentence id="560">So th-that -- that's a good -- good lesson.</sentence><sentence id="561">So -- so I never did, I always checked it all -- all the time, make sure.</sentence><sentence id="562">So anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, I'm gonna fix those babies now.</sentence><sentence id="563">And he says yeah, you know, what are you gonna do?</sentence><sentence id="564">I says, I'm gonna send them a phosphorous grenade.</sentence><sentence id="565">So I put a phosphorous grenade on cause they are -- they were the worst.</sentence><sentence id="566">The high explosions, they were bad, but th -- but the -- the others, they were worse, they -- oh, man, they were miserable.</sentence><sentence id="567">They -- cause when they -- when this phosphorous grenades went off, they didn't quit burning when -- if it hits you.</sentence><sentence id="568">Say like if a --if it hits you in -- in your arm, that would burn the whole way through your arm.</sentence><sentence id="569">It'll melt your -- even melt your bones, they said.</sentence><sentence id="570">And that's how hot it went.</sentence><sentence id="571">Anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, okay, I says, I'm ready to shoot, I says.</sentence><sentence id="572">You watch up over the top of them <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, see if you can see it going.</sentence><sentence id="573">And I stuck the huge -- you always stick the -- the stock of your rifle in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and raise the barrel up.</sentence><sentence id="574">And I was laying there</sentence><sentence id="576">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tare

said yeah.</sentence><sentence id="578">I said, well, here it goes.</sentence><sentence id="579">I reached down and I pulled the trigger.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="580">Well, that grenade, you could see it.</sentence><sentence id="581">I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it going.</sentence><sentence id="582">It went -- oh, it made a beautiful bow right up over the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and come down.</sentence><sentence id="583">And on the way down, it must have hit a -- a limb, because I don't think it went off at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, because it seemed like it --- when the -- when it disappeared and you couldn't see it, why, it was -- wasn't enough time for it to hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> when it exploded.</sentence><sentence id="584">But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of smoke, and flames, and -- and -- and it -- and the phosphorous was everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="585">And I heard them guys screaming up there where they -- where I was shooting at, so I--I --I'm pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming.</sentence><sentence id="586">Now, I never seen any of them, or anything like that, because they were pretty well camouflaged.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="587">Anyway, we -- we -- that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle.</sentence><sentence id="588">The Germans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over -- to get away from us.</sentence><sentence id="589">Our outfit, they -- they got up, they ran back the other way, Ine--I never figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong direction.</sentence><sentence id="590">So anyway, we didn't see no more Germans that night.</sentence><sentence id="591">And the me -- and my buddy, he s -- he's young.</sentence><sentence id="592">Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody's leaving us.</sentence><sentence id="593">I said, I'm not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded.</sentence><sentence id="594">And I ha --I had to take all my stuff off my rifle, and that -- you know, the launcher and everything, and -- to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="597">Interview with Grant Shultheis 21 October 8, 2010 get to my rifle to work right with the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="598">And then I put a--ac---a clip with nine rounds in it, then I was ready to go.</sentence><sentence id="599">Then I stood up, and when I stood up there wasn't a soul around, just him and I. Our men got up, they went the one way and the Germans went the other way.</sentence><sentence id="600">And that's another thing I never understood, why we went backwards instead of going forward.</sentence><sentence id="601">Anyway, we -- we didn't have no more problems with them that night.</sentence><sentence id="602">And then -- then my buddy and I, we went back to where the -- kind of back to where the machine gunners were and they had to stay up all night on guard, so we -- we each dug a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">Now, a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span>, I don't know whether you know what a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> is or not.</sentence><sentence id="604">Oh, you know?</sentence><sentence id="605">Okay, that's just where you can lay down in it, it's big enough.</sentence><sentence id="606">We di-- we dug that, each one of us dug a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, you might say.</sentence><sentence id="607">Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in under them <span class="ENV_FEATURES">leaves</span> and go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="608">And the -- we let the -- we let the machine gunners stay awake that night.</sentence><sentence id="609">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="610">Q: Did they soldiers you served with, were they good soldiers?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: Who?</sentence></p></dialogue>

flag.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at him.</sentence><sentence id="1390">So then I watched him and when he come down a piece, went a piece, why I -- I don't know how that German knew that guy but -- that guy was behind him -- but anyway, he climbed for altitude.</sentence><sentence id="1391">Now he went up, I would say, approximately a thousand

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> the whole way down and when it exploded, but it -- th-the -- the driver, he-he never made it out.</sentence><sentence id="1401">And he was only a young fella too, because when he come down and passed there at one time, I saw him sitting in there with both thumbs on the -- on the triggers, when he was shooting at me.</sentence><sentence id="1402">And I thought, if I stand still, he'1l miss me.</sentence><sentence id="1403">Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me.</sentence><sentence id="1404">Well, the one -- the one <span
