there.</sentence><sentence id="19">We were supposed to be staying there temporarily because it was not a proper -- not proper -- it's not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to have three more people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and especially three Jews, because there were seven children, it was very dangerous for the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="20">We did stay

on.</sentence><sentence id="45">We knew that the invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, for instance, we were very happy, because we thought we would be liberated

mean, we -- we heard some stuff, but we didn't know really the -- the -- the -- the -- the scale of the -- of the war, and the destruction of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="47">We would hear <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: No, th-the -- the hardest thing was really the fear.</sentence><sentence id="63">Boredom was -- somehow you -- you know, as a g -- as a girl I would -- could -- if there was some food, we could peel</sentence><sentence id="65">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 5 potatoes, I could knit, I could read.</sentence><sentence id="66">We were keenly aware that we were very much in the way, that we endangered the people we were hiding with, that there was not enough food.</sentence><sentence id="67">That we had -- somehow there was a terribly -- disturbance in the family, that my hiding mother was extremely anxious, that my hiding father was the one who wanted this, who did this, with all his heart.</sentence><sentence id="68">So we -- we -- we kind of picked up constantly these -- these -- these cues, I would say, from everyone.</sentence><sentence id="69">The children were angry, the little ones were -- the young ones in -- in that family were not -- you know, they -- they couldn't play the way they would play before, or talk, because they had to keep this a secret that we were there.</sentence><sentence id="70">A family would visit, we had to quickly go upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>, and then be very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="71">So it was a very tense situation.</sentence><sentence id="72">I -- Boredom was -- I would almost say secondary [indecipherable] you know, it was -- it was really the fear that any of us would do the wrong thing, and then it would leak out that we were hiding there, and then we would be sh -- sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and al -- and of course, my hiding father would be also picked up and sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">We didn't quite know that, but we knew it was extremely dangerous.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="666">Q: And when did that start to happen for you?</sentence><sentence id="667">When did you start to become more of a community of survivors?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: Actually, in the early -- in the early 80 -- actually, probably late 70's, or early 80's, I become more aware that I was different, that I had been in hiding, and there must be a lot of people who were in h -- had been in hiding, right around here, but I couldn't get to them, and since I was a social worker, and was a group -- also a group worker, I said, I -- I should maybe get this support group together.</sentence><sentence id="671">And what I did was I called the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span>, and I knew that other Dutch Jewish immigrants were in -- had been registered there.</sentence><sentence id="672">And so -- And luckily, the woman I spoke to was a social worker, so she knew what I was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="673">And I ask her if I could send -- if she would send a letter from me to people she knew who had been in the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, Jewish people who had been in war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and if they would then contact me, maybe we could meet.</sentence><sentence id="674">And so I</sentence><sentence id="676">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 23 started a support group, I think it was in 1982, of Dutch Holocaust survivors who had been in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="677">And the difficulty was that I th -- that we came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, <span class="REGION">Westchester county</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> -- I had k-kind of asked her to send letters to the me -- <span class="REGION">metropolitan area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">And we met the first time was kind of an interesting [indecipherable] maybe 20 people in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">We met, and there were older people who had been in hiding, and younger ones, like people who had been in hiding when they were in their 20's.</sentence><sentence id="680">And one man said immediately, he said, "You know, we don't need a group, we know who we are, but you youngsters, you were children and teenagers, you didn't ha -- you really didn't have an identity.</sentence><sentence id="681">You suffered more than we did, because we had an identity."</sentence><sentence id="682">And he wasn't so wrong, but I couldn't quite understand what this was all about.</sentence><sentence id="683">And so we met another two years with the people who were younger, because the older people said you know, that we don't want the group, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="684">We had this -- I had this support group with younger people who were children and teenagers in the war.</sentence><sentence id="685">And that was very interesting, only difficult -- we had a difficult time to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to meet, and -- and that kind of -- like I said, it was two years, that was until 1984.</sentence><sentence id="686">And so we had -- [ha -- I realized that y -- I found people I had something in common with.</sentence><sentence id="687">I think what -- maybe what I'm not talking about is that we really kind of led a so-called normal social life here, in -- in resh -- here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hastings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="688">You know, we went out, we had friends, we had dinner parties, but it -- it -- plus we were always a little different.</sentence><sentence id="689">It wasn't that we were completely isolated from -- from -- you know, from our neighbors, or the parents of our friends, or friends we had made on our own.</sentence><sentence id="690">But it wasn't like -- we didn't quite belong,</sentence><sentence id="692">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0050 24 it -- I can tell you, we were at the dinner party, and people had invited some friends, and there were like a couple of couples, and there were two couples who didn't know each other, and then they found out that they grew up on you know, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span>, and all of a sudden, they had such a strong connection, even, to you know, I don't know which one it was, Public PS whatever, and do you know that, you know, this one, and do you know that one, and what did you play in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, stickball, and you know, we didn't do this, whatever they played.</sentence><sentence id="693">And I realized, I never can meet anybody who I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="694">So these kind of things did happen, and I felt very kind of isolated, and when the -- when do I ever meet somebody I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with?</sentence><sentence id="695">So, I guess what I wanted to say to you is we kind of led an -- an -- a normal social life here, but felt different, because we had gone through the war.</sentence><sentence id="696">When we -- When I had the s- support group of Dutch Hidden Children, we had some connection, I had some connection.</sentence><sentence id="697">And in the meantime, I had become a Social Worker, and I was working as a Social Worker, and -- which was -- I -- I -- I loved my work, and -- but I didn't have the same background as they had, although, you know, I was very well integrated in my, you know, professional community, of where I worked, at work, you know, there was -- I -- I -- I felt pretty -- pretty comfortable there.</sentence><sentence id="698">Then, in ni -- 1980 -- 1990, we did our interview in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and it's a very complicated story how we -- how they -- how we found them, and how they found us.</sentence><sentence id="699">We did go for a weekend to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washingt</span> -- to be int -- to <span

monitor, and we were completely wiped out after we had told the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="703">It was really from -- you probably saw -- you saw the video, so it was from early years, and then into -- into the war years.</sentence><sentence id="704">And we were absolutely emotionally exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="705">And that was really the very first time that I had told my whole story.</sentence><sentence id="706">I -- I even now get, you know, very moved about it, and I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="707">So that was in 1990.</sentence><sentence id="708">At the same time -- at the same -- around that time, one of my colleagues gave me an -- he said, "You know, you might be," -- I had spoken with him, I guess, about my background.</sentence><sentence id="709">He gave me an announcement of an -- of a conference in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, about the psycho-his -- the psycho-history association gave an -- an -- an --
