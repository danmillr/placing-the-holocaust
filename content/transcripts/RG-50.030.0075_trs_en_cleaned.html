<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, we had -- my grandmother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">And, of course, I had uncles and my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="74">And we did have family.</sentence><sentence id="75">There were some cousins.</sentence><sentence id="76">We were very fond of our grandmother, and I spent a lot of time there; and my mother also had her parents, who lived in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">And so she had support from both families, both on her husband's side and on her, her own parents" side.</sentence><sentence id="78">But after my dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, he used to help us.</sentence><sentence id="79">When my dad came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, it was right after, I believe, the Depression.</sentence><sentence id="80">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, and earned three dollars a week working for <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Sausage Company</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">And the story went that my dad would send us a dollar and a half to live on in Europe -- which was a lot of money at that time in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="82">And, of course, he lived on a dollar and a half here.</sentence><sentence id="83">And when my dad came here, immigration was very strict.</sentence><sentence id="84">In those days, a man had to show that he could support a family before he was allowed to bring a family to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And I believe there's a long story behind this, but by the time my dad was able to send us papers to immigrate to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the war had broken out.</sentence><sentence id="86">And my mother was afraid to take her family.</sentence><sentence id="87">I had two younger brothers; and my mother was afraid to take three children on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that might have been bombed on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span>, that were beginning to be bombed already because the war had broken out.</sentence><sentence id="88">I, I believe this is the joke of, of the century: her being afraid to take us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that might be bombed, and then getting caught in the war in Europe and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">You know?</sentence><sentence id="90">So....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: As you speak of the war beginning, could you tell us what your first impressions were of the beginning of the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: The first -- okay.</sentence><sentence id="113">The first that I really knew that Jews were being persecuted in Europe was as a child.</sentence><sentence id="114">I recall my mother taking us -- meaning my brothers, my two brothers and herself -- going to my grandfather's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my grandparents lived, where my mother was born and came from.</sentence><sentence id="115">And she took us there, often times, for visits.</sentence><sentence id="116">And, I believe, in 1939 when the Germans took away citizenship from the Polish Jews that emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, became German citizens, established businesses in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and fought for the German government.</sentence><sentence id="117">These Jews were asked to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when Hitler came into power.</sentence><sentence id="118">He took away their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>, as you well know; and he took -- confiscated everything they had, and sent them back over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">When these Jews came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="120">They had no <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>; and of course the Polish community did not want these Jews back.</sentence><sentence id="121">So a lot of the Jews were being persecuted, and a lot of them went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">My grandparents lived close to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>; and, of course, in -- near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">I recall, as a child, these Jews coming down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> looking for <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span>; and begging for food, begging for warm clothing and so forth, to take back to their families in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="124">I recall, as a child, helping my grandfather; taking buckets, pretending we were going to feed the animals, and going into the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> for whatever reason.</sentence><sentence id="125">And carrying food and warm clothing in these buckets to take back to these people, so that they could take it back to their families.</sentence><sentence id="126">I recall hearing horror stories of Jews being persecuted in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">Of course, we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="128">But we knew -- I knew, as a child, that Jews were being persecuted.</sentence><sentence id="129">And I recall hiding many of these young Jewish people that would come; and putting them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and covering them with straw and whatever, and taking them into different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">So that we could help these young Jews escape.</sentence><sentence id="131">We still had freedom at that time, and little did we know that we were going to be next.</sentence><sentence id="132">That we were going to be persecuted.</sentence><sentence id="133">So I did know at that time that Jews were being persecuted.</sentence><sentence id="134">But we still lived in peace with our neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="135">We, as I said, were not being persecuted at that time.</sentence><sentence id="136">Our life was peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="137">The businessmen did or went about their business as they pleased.</sentence><sentence id="138">And that was my first recollection.</sentence><sentence id="139">Then I recall going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in Czecho- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klyucharki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I had a young uncle that must have been 17, 18 years old at the time; and as <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was being occupied, this uncle pretended he was going to take eggs and things off of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to go into the big city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">He would take these things and put them in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and pedal to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>; strictly to find out about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, what was happening around the world, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="142">Because that was the only news we could really get.</sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't have television and we didn't have radio, as they do today.</sentence><sentence id="144">And my uncle used to come back and bring us bits and pieces of news.</sentence><sentence id="145">We were not allowed to listen to this news, we as children.</sentence><sentence id="146">We were being protected.</sentence><sentence id="147">And we were just -- we were getting bits and pieces of this.</sentence><sentence id="148">So I did know that in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> Jews, because they were Jews, they were being persecuted.</sentence><sentence id="149">But we ourselves were not touched by it at that point.</sentence><sentence id="150">Actually, I personally was not affected by this until Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and took over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Do you remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: My first recollection was when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">The night before going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my friend who was not Jewish -- she and I slept in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">Slept in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, played as children do.</sentence><sentence id="195">I remember my mother opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> and telling us to go to sleep, because we were being noisy and the next day was <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">She and I got up in the morning to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, one morning.</sentence><sentence id="197">When we came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, she was allowed to walk in and the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed to me.</sentence><sentence id="198">I was told I was not allowed to walk into <span class="BUILDING">class</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="199">I needed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="200">A teacher who was my teacher, who took out a white handkerchief from his pocket the week before to wipe a smudge off of my face, turned to me one day and told me I must not come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="201">All of a sudden, for whatever reason, I needed to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and not come back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">I remember going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and crying, and not understanding why I was not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="203">A few minutes later, my two brothers came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying.</sentence><sentence id="204">They too were sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and were told not to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="205">Because we became quote "Jewish" overnight.</sentence><sentence id="206">My mother had to sit down with us and tell us the facts of life.</sentence><sentence id="207">Tell us why we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore; tell us that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was invaded by a man called Hitler who was a bad man.</sentence><sentence id="208">We did not know about the killings at that time -- at least, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="209">But we were told that there were certain rules we needed to follow from now on, and one was not to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">I recall the laws being set down one by one.</sentence><sentence id="211">Not being able to go to a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>, except during certain hours.</sentence><sentence id="212">Not being able to work our <span class="DLF">farms</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="213">Not being able to walk into a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> anymore, except during certain hours.</sentence><sentence id="214">Not to go into a <span class="DLF">park</span> and sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, unless it said, "For Jews Only."</sentence><sentence id="215">The wearing of the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="216">And the hours we were allowed to be out, and the hours we were -- has to be back in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And those were the first that I personally felt.</sentence><sentence id="218">And then, of course, the laws that came down one by one.</sentence><sentence id="219">Everyday there was a new law, and everyday we had to obey the new law.</sentence><sentence id="220">And we were not allowed to walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="221">If someone came towards us that was not a Jew, the Jew needed to step off the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> to allow the next person -- who of course was not Jewish -- to walk by.</sentence><sentence id="222">I recall our neighbors turning their backs on us.</sentence><sentence id="223">Spitting on us.</sentence><sentence id="224">Neighbors who lived in peace with us, who were our friends the week before.</sentence><sentence id="225">And then, of course, we were lucky we were farmers; because we would have starved to death.</sentence><sentence id="226">You know, it's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="227">You, you sit and, and you talk, and as you sat and memories came back.</sentence><sentence id="228">It took me many, many years to find out why my mother would put food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for her three children at night, give us our dinner, and after she served us, she would walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">She never stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we ate.</sentence><sentence id="230">I could never understand this.</sentence><sentence id="231">Just recently -- shows you how smart I am -- I've just recently figured this out.</sentence><sentence id="232">I probably had forgotten all of this.</sentence><sentence id="233">The reason she didn't stay with us was because there wasn't enough food to go around.</sentence><sentence id="234">So those are my early memories of Hitler walking into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">And, of course, then there was the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="236">We were told to gather our belongings, take warm clothes, take our valuables, and to take our pots and pans.</sentence><sentence id="237">We were told we were going to be relocated.</sentence><sentence id="238">And as we know today, they lied.</sentence><sentence id="239">And we believed.</sentence><sentence id="240">I'm not sure if our parents knew what was going to happen or not.</sentence><sentence id="241">But we believed.</sentence><sentence id="242">I think we needed to believe.</sentence><sentence id="243">And, of course, as we know how brave Hitler was -- the knock came in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="244">It was the last days of Passover when they came to get us, and they told us to take whatever food we could.</sentence><sentence id="245">We didn't have bread in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="246">We still had matzo.</sentence><sentence id="247">I remember my mother packing matzo to take with us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">It seems like yesterday.</sentence></p></dialogue>
