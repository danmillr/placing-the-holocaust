<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you state your name, please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Milner Roberts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Can we have a little background information from you, General Roberts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Well, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> in September of 1918 and spent most of my early life there.</sentence><sentence id="10">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>, and from there I went to <span class="BUILDING">Lehigh University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethlehem</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where I majored in metallurgy and had a minor in English and journalism, and also you might say a minor in military.</sentence><sentence id="11">And I was commissioned a second lieutenant infantry reserve in May of 1940, when war was already raging in Europe, and they weren't calling us up at that point.</sentence><sentence id="12">So I went into industry and worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> for a while for a <span class="BUILDING">machine tool manufacturer</span> -- was assigned to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Chrysler tank</span> arsenal where they were making the brand new medium <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, then called the General Grant.</sentence><sentence id="13">Our tools were being used to machine parts of it.</sentence><sentence id="14">On December 7th, 1941, I was minding my own business, driving down one of the major <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> listening to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> radio, and Pearl Harbor was announced.</sentence><sentence id="15">So I thought, well, Roberts, look around.</sentence><sentence id="16">You're not going to be around here very long, which turned out to be very accurate.</sentence><sentence id="17">That happened to be a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="18">he next day I went back to the tank arsenal and there was an ordnance lieutenant colonel there in charge for the army.</sentence><sentence id="19">He knew I was a reserve officer and he said, "Roberts, why don't you go and put your uniform on?</sentence><sentence id="20">Come by, I'll put you to work," and I said, "Well, that's a nice idea, but I don't think the infantry would really like that and, furthermore, my father wouldn't like that either because he was a combat officer in World War I and he thinks that I ought to be a combat officer.</sentence><sentence id="21">So thanks very much."</sentence><sentence id="22">So sure enough, in about a week, they sent me preliminary orders and I reported at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span>, <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> where I went through a course to start with and then became an instructor in weapons.</sentence><sentence id="23">And from April, 1942 until June of 1943, I taught OSC, the general art of handling machine guns and related items.</sentence><sentence id="24">And by June of 1943 I was thinking, gee, I'm here on a <span class="BUILDING">training base</span> and there's action elsewhere, and if I don't get out of here, the war might be over.</sentence><sentence id="25">So I put in for the airborne and next thing I knew I was a glider infantry company commander assigned to a newly organized airborne division at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Bragg</span>, <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">So I went through all of the glider training for the next six months, and then the War Department, as it was called in those days, decided that they had made a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="27">They had too many glider elements and not enough parachute elements.</sentence><sentence id="28">So they said, we're going to break up this glider regiment and send you guys to Europe because they may need you over there.</sentence><sentence id="29">So in the end of March or early April, 1944, I found myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bristol</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, earmarked for the 101st Airborne Division.</sentence><sentence id="30">Well, actually, I didn't look forward to flying over the English Channel in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> but, anyway, that was the assignment until about five days before the actual attack, which people had been talking about for literally years.</sentence><sentence id="31">When is the second <span class="NPIP">front</span> going to open?</sentence><sentence id="32">When are you going into Europe?</sentence><sentence id="33">I found myself assigned as a tactical aide to the commander of what turned out to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span>, and this was a General Leonard Gerow, commanding the Fifth Army Corps.</sentence><sentence id="34">So he said, "Roberts," he said, "Do you know how to read a map?"</sentence><sentence id="35">I said, "Yes, sir."</sentence><sentence id="36">He said, "You know how to read a photo map?"</sentence><sentence id="37">I said, "That in particular, because in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span>, you didn't have any handy dandy maps with you.</sentence><sentence id="38">You had aerial photos -- about all you had."</sentence><sentence id="39">He said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="40">We'll give you the job."</sentence><sentence id="41">So I landed on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span> with elements of the 16th Infantry in the First Division right in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">It was called the Easy Red section.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: A misnomer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Well, in a way it was a misnomer from the point of being easy, but from the point of view of being red, it had something along that <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">They divided the <span class="DLF">beachhead</span> into different sections, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, and George, and then each one of those with the red and white type, all for planning purposes.</sentence><sentence id="81">So without going into any great detail, I survived D- Day.</sentence><sentence id="82">Then for the rest of the campaign in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, I would be sent out with elements of our combat forces every day and then report back to the general on what I had observed.</sentence><sentence id="83">And this was a period when we were stalemated for awhile in what was called the Hedgerow area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, but we finally made a breakout in July at and within a matter of about 10 days, we had swung around and headed east and actually bottled up almost the whole German seventh army in an <span class="REGION">area</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">It was the so- called <span class="DLF">Falaise gap</span>, and we effectively destroyed the German resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because -- it wasn't true for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, but it certainly was true for that section of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Seine River</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And then we were given the opportunity to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on the 25th of August, 1944, and that was a great occasion but we didn't stay long.</sentence><sentence id="86">They said, well, now, you guys go chasing Germans east of here.</sentence><sentence id="87">So within a matter of about three days, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sedan</span>, which had been featured in World War I, and then we really didn't have too much effective resistance in our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span>, which is a pleasant little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and we got there and we were stopped at what the Germans call the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span>, which is a <span class="DLF">line</span> of fortifications somewhat parallel to the <span class="DLF">French Maginot Line</span> but somewhat removed from it.</sentence><sentence id="89">The principle reason we were stopped was because we were running out of our fuel and food.</sentence><sentence id="90">Our <span class="DLF">supply line</span> went all the way back to the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> and it became difficult to really move forward and have supplies catch up.</sentence><sentence id="91">Furthermore, there was a fair amount of opposition further south.</sentence><sentence id="92">After General Patton's Third Army got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.119202" long="6.179172">Metz</span>, it was stalemated for a relatively short time.</sentence><sentence id="93">And then there were some problems in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vosges Mountains</span> further south.</sentence><sentence id="94">The <span class="REGION">northern advance</span> had been faster than the <span class="REGION">southern advance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">And then I was relieved from my assignment as an aide because General Gerow had been head of the War Plans Division at the time of Pearl Harbor, and the first Pearl Harbor Inquiry in the Congress was made in that fall.</sentence><sentence id="96">So they call him back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and he said, "Roberts, what do you want to do?"</sentence><sentence id="97">I said, "Well, sir, what I really want to do is to match my old man's accomplishment, who got to be a major in World War I. So I would like to get promoted."</sentence><sentence id="98">He said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="99">I'll put you in a staff section where you can have the opportunity to get promoted.</sentence><sentence id="100">So at that point, he put me in what was called G-5, Military Government Civil Affairs Operation of the Corps, and I continued in that until the end the of the war when I was reassigned to the G-2 section, which is intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="101">So we got involved with the Battle of the Bulge, very heavily involved on the <span class="REGION">northern shoulder</span>, and we were confronted with the 12th S.S. Panzer division, sometimes called Hitler Jugend.</sentence><sentence id="102">We had already been in touch with a couple of other S.S. Panzer divisions, the 1st Panzer division of Adolph Hitler and the 2nd Das Reich and we were accustomed to these guys.</sentence><sentence id="103">We also had been up against some of their elite units -- 3rd Parachute Division and other kinds of divisions -- but the northern shoulder held pretty well."</sentence><sentence id="104">And by February, we were straightening out the <span class="DLF">line</span> and ready to move to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="105">We got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> in early March of 1945, particularly to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span> where the Germans tried to blow up the <span class="DLF">railroad bridge</span> but failed.</sentence><sentence id="106">They seriously weakened it, but not enough to prevent a number of our people from crossing over and getting a beachhead on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>, which was significant.</sentence><sentence id="107">The 69th Division is the one that actually crossed that <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">We then put <span class="DLF">pontoon bridges</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied</span>, which was quite a job.</sentence><sentence id="109">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> is a very fast-moving stream, four or five miles an hour, which, if you try to put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pontoons</span> across it, it takes a little doing.</sentence><sentence id="110">We had two of them across there, one east bound, one west bound.</sentence><sentence id="111">It was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuwied</span> that we first ran across some very unhappy people.</sentence><sentence id="112">These were not political refugees.</sentence><sentence id="113">They were prisoners of war who had been poorly treated.</sentence><sentence id="114">They were all emaciated, not in very good shape, but at least they were alive and we -- that was a portrait, a kind of a little future look at what we might find later.</sentence><sentence id="115">So we then circled around and completed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment.</sentence><sentence id="116">The <span class="REGION">Ruhr area</span> -- heavily industrial, <span class="BUILDING">Krupp works</span>, this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="117">And we closed the <span class="DLF">gap</span> and captured tens of thousands of prisoners, and it was obvious that the end was coming along pretty soon.</sentence><sentence id="118">So after that we headed east again and against limited opposition.</sentence><sentence id="119">I can recall going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.316695" long="9.499993">Kassel</span>, a pretty good size <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">The main <span class="DLF">street</span> was probably four miles long, and in that entire four miles, I didn't find one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was still intact.</sentence><sentence id="121">There were a lot of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with the <span class="DLF">walls</span> up but the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> burned off.</sentence><sentence id="122">It had been pretty heavily damaged.</sentence><sentence id="123">But on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.316695" long="9.499993">Kassel</span>, we found an <span class="BUILDING">airplane production plant</span> that was still going strong until we got there.</sentence><sentence id="124">So the Germans still had considerable capability even though they had been very heavily bombed.</sentence><sentence id="125">But just about the time we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.316695" long="9.499993">Kassel</span>, we found a very hideous sight, and that was an insane <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="8.05">Hadamar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">Hadamar had been an ordinary institution for the mentally infirm probably back to maybe 1900, but after Hitler came to power in 1933 and began his pogrom against the Jews, he also found it convenient to try to get rid of a lot of non-Jews who were political opponents.</sentence><sentence id="127">So sometime in the late "30s, they passed a law which said that if you were found to be insane, you would be assigned to an <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> where you would be eliminated; because the theory was that the insane people might procreate and their progeny then would injure the purity of the Nordic race.</sentence><sentence id="128">I think that was the theory.</sentence><sentence id="129">You know, it's almost laughable, this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="130">Anyway, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="8.05">Hadamar</span>, we found just mounds of clothing, men and women's clothing, and at that point, no bodies.</sentence><sentence id="131">They had already disposed of them.</sentence><sentence id="132">But we found something else, the S.S. Totenkopf elements of the S.S. divisions.</sentence><sentence id="133">Well, actually, it was a separate organization for prison guards -- had taken skulls and with a band saw, had cut them around about this <span class="REGION">area</span>, and then there was a little depression in the resulting top of the skull.</sentence><sentence id="134">And they had used these to have toasts to the greater glorification of the Reich, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="135">Well, that's pretty hard to believe, that kind of a thing, but there it was.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">" The aforementioned divisions comprised units of the German Sixth SS Panzer Army under the command of SS Colonel Josef Dietrich.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Did you inspect the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: I did not, no.</sentence><sentence id="139">Some of our other people did but I didn't have really enough time to do that.</sentence><sentence id="140">But I did see the skulls, which made a great impression on everybody.</sentence><sentence id="141">We began to grasp then the awful dimensions of what evidently had been going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Did you inspect the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> at all?</sentence><sentence id="147">Do you know whether there were any <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> or any other facilities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="151">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> because that's how they dispose of these people, but not on the scale of an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> or any of these other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">This was a somewhat limited operation but, nevertheless, just as deadly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Do you know how they disposed of the bodies?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: I think they buried them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">They certainly didn't bury them individually.</sentence><sentence id="160">And I don't think that -- I don't know what the final report was.</sentence><sentence id="161">I didn't see it, but that's our impression.</sentence><sentence id="162">They certainly didn't have individual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">burials</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">I think they just buried them in a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span>, other than the ones they burned up.</sentence><sentence id="164">Anyway, we further -- went further east, and it was just at that time that Franklin Roosevelt died.</sentence><sentence id="165">I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> listening to the armed forces network when they announced that Roosevelt died, which really was a profound shock to everybody.</sentence><sentence id="166">I think it was the 13th of April, either the 12th or the 13th, and we were dismayed at the fact that he was the leader who had decided that he was going to carry out the four freedoms and we were in the process of doing part of that, and he was gone.</sentence><sentence id="167">And we had little knowledge of Harry Truman so -- but we couldn't afford to think about it too much.</sentence><sentence id="168">We had other things to do.</sentence><sentence id="169">So we proceeded over towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span>, a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> going back hundreds of years, and it was a pleasure to note that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gettingen</span> wasn't damaged much.</sentence><sentence id="170">By the time you go through a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village towns</span> that have been terribly shot up, it gets depressing.</sentence><sentence id="171">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not badly shot up except for the <span class="BUILDING">Bahnhof</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, which is always a point of attack.</sentence><sentence id="172">And it was there that I was assigned to take the surrender of a German general who had passed the word that he would like to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="173">It turned out that he had been injured on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> and been sent back to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for recuperation.</sentence><sentence id="174">And now with his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> completely in the possession of the Americans, he felt he better opt to surrender rather than being forced to.</sentence><sentence id="175">So I and my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver went up to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver, by the way, was a young Jewish boy named Harry Adler.</sentence><sentence id="177">I'll have more on him later.</sentence><sentence id="178">So I went up to the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and the general in full regalia -- he was a General Korps Infantrie, which is the same as a three star general.</sentence><sentence id="179">He'd been a German corps commander.</sentence><sentence id="180">He came out in his full regalia with his hat on and the uniform.</sentence><sentence id="181">He saluted.</sentence><sentence id="182">I saluted him back.</sentence><sentence id="183">He then ceremoniously presented me with his Luger, which I said, "Fine, good.</sentence><sentence id="184">Get out and get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>."</sentence><sentence id="185">And then he said, "I can get in the back."</sentence><sentence id="186">I said, "No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="187">I think you ought to ride in the front.</sentence><sentence id="188">I'll be in the back."</sentence><sentence id="189">For all I know, he might have had another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luger</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">So then he said, "Well, now, I have to see your general."</sentence><sentence id="191">All this was in German and Harry Adler was translating.</sentence><sentence id="192">So I said, "Well, we'll see."</sentence><sentence id="193">So I took him to a P.W. cage as it was called, just an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> for prisoners, and I turned the general over to those people and that's the last I saw of him; except later on I heard he was highly incensed because they wouldn't permit him to talk to our general.</sentence><sentence id="194">He was briefed by probably some captain -- or debriefed.</sentence><sentence id="195">He didn't know much.</sentence><sentence id="196">He'd been out of action for two or three months.</sentence><sentence id="197">But my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> driver, Harry Adler.</sentence><sentence id="198">Harry was born of a Jewish family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I suppose about 1925, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="199">So as a youth in the mid-"30s, his father thought, I don't like the way things are going here.</sentence><sentence id="200">So I think it was about 1938, the family got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and went into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And so young Adler was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, what turned out to be <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span>, and then he, of course, then learned to speak French.</sentence><sentence id="202">But about the time of the Vichy surrender to the Nazis, the father said,"This isn't very good either.</sentence><sentence id="203">Let's see if we can get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>."</sentence><sentence id="204">And so they got through into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>, I've forgotten which.</sentence><sentence id="205">Anyway, they finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> about 1940.</sentence><sentence id="206">So the young Adler was then sent to <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span>, by that time he'd had a little <span class="BUILDING">Lyceum</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">So by 1942 or "43 when he went in the army, he was trilingual, German, French, and English, and he was exactly what I needed, because I had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> French but I had no German.</sentence><sentence id="208">It wasn't popular in those days, post World War I, to teach German because of the World War I situation.</sentence><sentence id="209">So as Adler and I were traveling around together, he was very much aware of what had been going on and he was very happy to be involved in taking a German general prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="210">But not long after that, in fact, on the 19th and 20th of April, we captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, which was a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and then we began to find some really grisly things.</sentence><sentence id="211">About that same time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> to our right or south of us had overrun <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">I was not involved in the direct liberation or -- you couldn't call it liberation, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="213">You can call it the capture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">But I did go down there because of my military assignment, and there they had a lot of bodies not burned yet, and they were stacked up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: How soon after its liberation, for lack of a better word?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Maybe two or three days.</sentence><sentence id="275">I wasn't there at the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: How long did you stay there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Oh, it was just to visit, to see what was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="450">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="451">We didn't see any survivors.</sentence><sentence id="452">Now there may have been survivors who -- when the guards took off, also took off because it's quite understandable.</sentence><sentence id="453">I mean, if you got a chance to get out of there, you got out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="458">Q: Can you describe the physical characteristics?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: It was a similar <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> but a much smaller scale.</sentence><sentence id="461">There was not as many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> that existed there were not as large a scale, and it seemed to us as though this were kind of a last kind of addition to this whole series of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all the rest of them.</sentence><sentence id="462">And so in any case, like this, including the one near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="470">A: It would have been on the -- either the third or fourth of May, 1945deg, and unfortunately it does not mention it in this book because the -- this book that I'm going to read something from was published very shortly after V-Day in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="471">It says on the cover from "42 to the 9th of May of "45, and I think some of the details of that kind of thing were just not put in here but -- oh, I was going to tell you that once we discovered something like this, the elements of the military police get involved.</sentence><sentence id="472">The Judge Advocate General people get involved and they then began to do an official history of what was found, when, where, and all the details.</sentence><sentence id="473">And I am sure that in the archives of the American Army, there is a complete description of what they found at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="478">Q: Were there any prior briefings as to what to expect?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="480">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="481">I think the reason for that was that they didn't fully grasp what the potential was.</sentence><sentence id="482">They might have decided to do something like that, certainly after they came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, which was about the same time they discovered others further south, but we had no actual 3 According to the International Refugee Organization, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> was liberated on 23 April 1945 following a mass evacuation of most of the prisoners to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> three days earlier.</sentence><sentence id="483">0 formal instructions.</sentence><sentence id="484">What we did know was, number one, take care of any survivors medically and also see to their welfare; that is, proper food and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, clothing, and then have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of our military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people there to see from that point of view what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="485">But this was kind of a do as you find it.</sentence><sentence id="486">I don't recall any at that point -- I'm still talking about the battle phase of this -- at that point any formal directives along this <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="487">Now we had formal directives for the recovery of allied military personnel.</sentence><sentence id="488">In other words, this was what they called RAMP, acronym, recovery Allied military personnel.</sentence><sentence id="489">And those directives were pretty clearly in place, and I may be wrong, but I never saw any specific directives for this type of thing.</sentence><sentence id="490">I think they just didn't anticipate it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="505">A: We had no directives.</sentence><sentence id="506">All we had was what you might call common sense.</sentence><sentence id="507">We felt that if we could identify any of them, that's one thing, but no dog tags on them.</sentence><sentence id="508">I mean there simply was no way to identify them and you couldn't let them rot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: How did this affect you personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Oh, it was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="516">Let me give you an example of that.</sentence><sentence id="517">After V-E Day we were headquartered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and we had a major problem with displaced persons, mostly eastern European, but a few from the west, who obviously wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">But things were in such turmoil that we just couldn't send them <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">We had to do something with them.</sentence><sentence id="520">So we put them mainly in the <span class="BUILDING">Kaserns</span>, previous German military installations , where at night they would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could feed them and take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="521">But there we had to maintain some kind of discipline.</sentence><sentence id="522">You just can't allow people in a very distraught frame of mind to be on their own.</sentence><sentence id="523">And we weren't putting in any harsh discipline - - that I'll mention in a minute -- but we had to see if they had certain standards.</sentence><sentence id="524">And I was visiting one of these <span class="NPIP">places</span> one day, probably about the middle of May 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="654">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="655">Now, this a printed description of the incident I've told you about near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> (reads): "At the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thekla</span> northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, our troops overran another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political prison camp</span> which still showed evidence of a horrible massacre on the previous day.</sentence><sentence id="656">With rescue by the Americans only a few hours away, inmates were herded into one long wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> by their brutal S.S. guards.</sentence><sentence id="657">After locking the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and covering the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, the guards then threw incendiary grenades upon the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="658">In a moment the whole <span class="BUILDING">structure</span> was a roaring inferno filled with screaming human beings.</sentence><sentence id="659">A few broke out into the <span class="DLF">open</span>, only to be met by a hail of rifle fire which cut them down, their clothing still burning.</sentence><sentence id="660">The smaller number that escaped had cleared their way through thick rolls of barbed wire, tearing their burning flesh in a miraculous dash to safety.</sentence><sentence id="661">The rest were shot down and their naked charred bodies were still there when our troops arrived.</sentence><sentence id="662">So here on the outskirts of one of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s greatest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, world famous for its beautiful <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, its culture, its monuments to great men," <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, that is, "there stood a monument to a new type of German culture that the world should never forget."</sentence><sentence id="663">And this was written in June of 1945.And so this tells you how we felt about this kind of thing that we had uncovered.</sentence><sentence id="664">I think it's significant that it's in that book.</sentence><sentence id="665">Primarily that book is telling about the military operations.</sentence><sentence id="666">Of course, we didn't run across too much of this, but it was incidental to the principle purpose, which is to record how this -- how the whole battle went, who was involved, where, when, and where.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="681">Q: I heard you have two artifacts.</sentence><sentence id="682">Would you like to explain to us what they are and how you came about them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="685">A: Well, this one is a ceremonial dagger.</sentence><sentence id="686">There were a number of different Nazi organizations, some military, some paramilitary, and they all had their own --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="717">Q: Were these carried by officers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="719">A: No, not necessarily.</sentence><sentence id="720">This could have been carried by NCOs as well as officers and I'm not certain if this one was actually an S.S. type.</sentence><sentence id="721">It looks like it but I'm not a hundred percent sure.</sentence><sentence id="722">I know there are now books where you can find -- which you can totally identify these things.</sentence><sentence id="723">I have another one which is silver with a pearl handle.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="731">4 Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: General, if you could explain the picture that we have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="736">That picture shows what is left and what we found of the remains of the people in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I talked about being deliberately burned.</sentence><sentence id="737">These remains, the corpses, you can see were huddled together, and died together and there's nothing left of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> except the ashes of these burned up bodies.</sentence><sentence id="738">Now some of them --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="743">Q: Can you again tell us the geographic location?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="745">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="746">This happened in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thekla</span>, which I would guess was probably 12 or 14 kilometers northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="747">And these people who were largely eastern Europeans, had been treated as slave labor by the Nazis and were working in, for one thing, an <span class="BUILDING">aircraft parts factory</span>, and there may have been a couple of other <span class="NPIP">places</span> they worked.</sentence><sentence id="748">They would take them out during the day and bring them back to these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">As I said, when we approached, they marched out, some of them could still maneuver pretty well.</sentence><sentence id="750">The rest of them they loaded in this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and burned to death.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="757">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="758">Where these bodies are huddled, that's the center of what would have been the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="762">It's approximately the center of what would have been the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">The outline of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> is still there, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: And what is depicted in the background?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="769">A: The background shows another <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> similar to the one that was burned up.</sentence><sentence id="770">They didn't choose to burn all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="771">They just burned the one in which they had all these people en masse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: And this is an original photograph?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: These pictures were taken within 48 hours after the event, maybe less than that, and by a Signal Corps photographer.</sentence><sentence id="778">Contrary to army regulations, he gave me a copy of them which I have kept every since because, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't believe what I was looking at.</sentence><sentence id="779">I thought, well, here it is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: Is there anything else you want to tell us about that particular photograph?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Not especially.</sentence><sentence id="786">It just shows that when people are in a desperate situation, they'll either fight or flee, and some of them were deciding to try to do something.</sentence><sentence id="787">They got together and they were just burned up en masse.</sentence><sentence id="788">Others decided to flee and were able to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, a few without being burned, who were then machine gunned down, and others who were 5 obviously on fire when they got out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">And we'll see in just a moment, if you'll take a look at the next picture.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="795">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="796">Would you describe the next picture for us?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="799">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="800">This shows about four, five, or six badly burned corpses which were outside the perimeter of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and who -- obviously their clothing was on fire and they were burned to death <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> trying to get out, and desperate to get to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and trying to get out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="803">Q: Do you have any recollection of how far the bodies were from the actual <span class="BUILDING">building</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="805">A: Well, those bodies would be perhaps 20 to 30 feet, not very far.</sentence><sentence id="806">If you're burning from head to foot, you're not going to move too far.</sentence><sentence id="807">It's a very grisly thing to look at and very, very hard to comprehend what people will do to other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="811">Q: Did you determine whether these people had been shot, in addition?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: No, they had not been shot, no.</sentence><sentence id="814">They hadn't been shot.</sentence><sentence id="815">There wasn't any point in shooting them.</sentence><sentence id="816">I imagine that by the time they hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, they were either dead or close to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: This also was taken by the same photographer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="824">All these pictures were taken by the same photographer at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="825">I might have mentioned the nonfraternization policy that the Army had, with good reason it turned out.</sentence><sentence id="826">We were not supposed to have any relations with German civilians except very perfunctory ones, such as where is the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> and where is the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and that kind of thing but since -- at the time this policy was prepared, they weren't aware of how bad the situation was, but they didn't want the Gls cozying up to the Germans at that point.</sentence><sentence id="827">And a number of our troops who were of German descent were pretty embarrassed about the whole deal.</sentence><sentence id="828">It didn't make them proud to have been of German descent.</sentence><sentence id="829">And then you think about the -- as this book says, the great accomplishments of the Germans in the arts and music and science and even theology, Martin Luther.</sentence><sentence id="830">And you come down to something like that and you wonder how it can happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="839">Q: (Inaudible.)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="841">A: Provisional.</sentence><sentence id="842">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="843">By that time we had no further use for anti-aircraft battalions, so they set up a provisional organization called security guards, and the letters on the helmet indicate that.</sentence><sentence id="844">These were -- they had nearly enough military police or regular organization to go around to handle everything we had run across, so they conferred these A.A. battalions primarily to security police and had their helmets painted accordingly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="849">Q: Would you describe this photograph here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="854">This shows more of the victims who, in their desperation to flee to safety, even though on fire, got as far as the <span class="DLF">concertina wire</span> that is formed around the <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> but then collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="855">You can see that their bodies continued to burn at that point.</sentence><sentence id="856">There were others who actually got into the <span class="DLF">wire</span> and twisted up in the <span class="DLF">wire</span>, and then were a few others who managed to get there without being on fire.</sentence><sentence id="857">We have a couple of pictures showing that there were some who got out with their clothes but they, again, were machine-gunned by the Totenkopf unit of the S.S.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="863">Q: There's one more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: This picture shows the perimeter of the <span class="REGION">area</span> and the type of <span class="DLF">wire enclosure</span> they had and also the floodlights so that they could illuminate it by night, and what you see up in the distance is a <span class="BUILDING">guard station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">And the <span class="REGION">area</span> was divided into a couple sections and you can see that this was a <span class="DLF">path</span> through two of the <span class="REGION">sections</span>.</sentence><sentence id="867">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> aren't visible here because -- I think one of them is possibly visible on the right but that's off to one <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">But it shows you the type of <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> that they kept these people in, not nearly as elaborate as they would have around some of the bigger <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, but then on a smaller scale.</sentence><sentence id="869">And they weren't organized for the same purpose, but the results were the same.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="875">Q: After leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span>, where did you go from there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="877">A: We went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and then I think I mentioned 18 kilometers east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>, we were stopped and we were there until the 18th of June, 1945 when they pulled us out.</sentence><sentence id="878">They said you're the people with amphibious attack experience, so we're going to take you out here and send you back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">And after you have a month of R &amp; R, so called, we will get you aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and send you to the Pacific, because we're going to be needing your assistance in the invasion of the main island of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honshu</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">And this was scheduled for October of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="881">Still you'll have enough time to see your friends when you get back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and then we'll ship you out to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span>, and from there we will ship you to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="882">And from the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> then, you will be used probably in a secondary landing after the principle one.</sentence><sentence id="883">So we thought, well, we're not looking forward to assaulting <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, but we are looking forward to getting back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="884">So we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LeHavre</span> on the fifth of July, 1945 on board a very fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> that had been the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">The army called it the West Point during World War II and crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> in about six days.</sentence><sentence id="886">We got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and we were among the early troops back so they had a big celebration for us.</sentence><sentence id="887">They had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> out in New York Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="888">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire boats</span> shooting off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, and they had people with jazz bands playing and whatever, whistles blowing.</sentence><sentence id="889">We thought that was nice, but it was even nicer to see the Statue of Liberty and be back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">And from there we were, as I say, given 30 days off.</sentence><sentence id="891">And at the end of the 30 days, the bomb went off in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and that precluded our use in the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, which suited us just fine, because if, in fact, Truman had not made that decision, it would have been anybody's guess, probably half a million casualties, both American and Japanese, and there had been enough death and dying already without that.</sentence><sentence id="892">So they let the genie out of the bottle as far as nuclear weapons are 7 concerned, but since they haven't been used since, it probably was a good idea in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">It saved a lot of lives at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="911">Q: How long did you remain in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">service</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="913">A: Well, in October of 1945 they said to me, "Now, Roberts, would you like to stay on active duty?"</sentence><sentence id="914">And I thought, well, the Army's going to be dullsville.</sentence><sentence id="915">Europe is flat on its back, so is <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="916"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is preeminent total world power.</sentence><sentence id="917">Who's going to start a war?</sentence><sentence id="918">I don't want to do close-order drill.</sentence><sentence id="919">So thanks a lot, but I'll go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="920">But I did say I would like to have a commission as a major in the <span class="DLF">reserve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="921">So that was forthcoming.</sentence><sentence id="922">And I did go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I got into the advertising and <span class="DLF">public relations field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="923">At the same time in the late 40s, they started to organize the reserve and I became increasingly active in that.</sentence><sentence id="924">And as a matter of fact, when <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, I was on active duty; but for reasons that the army later regretted, they didn't make use of organized reserve components very much then.</sentence><sentence id="925">They did to some extent, but if they had used more, it might have turned out a little differently.</sentence><sentence id="926">Anyway, for the next 20 years virtually I was increasingly active in the <span class="DLF">reserve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="927">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Army War College</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carlisle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="928">I went to the Command General Staff College at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leavenworth</span>, and by 1967 the Army then put me in charge of all the Army reserves in <span class="REGION">eastern Ohio</span>, West Virgina, and <span class="REGION">western Pennsylvania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="929">Then in 1970 they asked me to come back on full duty in the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span>, initially as a Deputy Chief of the Army Reserve on the army general staff, and then as Chief of the Army Reserve from 1971 to 1975.</sentence><sentence id="930">So I had an unusual career in that I had four years early on of full duty, and five years virtually of full duty at the end, and reserve duty in between with many periods of active service and schooling.</sentence><sentence id="931">I was promoted to major general as I assumed Chief of the Army Reserve at the beginning of May, rather, in May of 1971, and so I'm now a major general of the United States Army, retired.</sentence><sentence id="932">I'm wearing an insignia today of the Distinguished Service Medal, which we used to call the general's good conduct medal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="953">Q: Have you previously discussed your experiences in Europe and what you saw with other groups or people or with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">service</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="955">A: Not specifically in this type of <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="956">I did do an audio oral history for the <span class="BUILDING">Army War College</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carlisle</span>, which took me through, of course, my experiences in World War II and my early experience and subsequent, but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing, although it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today.</sentence><sentence id="957">There have been some references to that history.</sentence><sentence id="958">A chap published a book recently in which he attributed some of his comments to my oral history.</sentence><sentence id="959">So since I left the active army for nine years, I became executive director of the Reserve Officer's Association, which is a major military lobby on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capitol Hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="960">Since then, I have been working with General Daniel Graham and the Strategic Defense Initiative program, which seems to be going along in good shape now, despite many of our critics who wish we would go away, but we haven't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="967">Q: Are there any concluding remarks you wish to make?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="971">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="972">I think that it's fair to say that the American public represents a force for good in the world.</sentence><sentence id="973">We have plenty of blemishes in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and things we have done that we shouldn't have done, maybe things that we could do but haven't done, but by and large, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> stands as a good moral force for good in this world.</sentence><sentence id="974">We're always the first to send relief anywhere in the world, whether it's former foes or friends.</sentence><sentence id="975">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> built up Europe after the war with the Marshall Plan.</sentence><sentence id="976">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> handled the Japanese in a very positive way.</sentence><sentence id="977">And when things have gotten out of shape, why, dear old Uncle Sam was asked to come forth.</sentence><sentence id="978">And we've done that and I have been proud to be a part of that total operation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
