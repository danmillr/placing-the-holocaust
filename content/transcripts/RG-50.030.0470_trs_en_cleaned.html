<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: It's very -- it's sort of very -- it's -- its, diminutive names are used a lot in all <span class="REGION">Slavic countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">So, it's very normal for someone from a <span class="REGION">Slavic country</span> to use that, but it's really not -- it sounds very strange, I think, in English.</sentence><sentence id="64">I know a young woman who lives here who's from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span>, and she's called Bekica, and it's Becky, and to me it's like sounds very strange.</sentence><sentence id="65">It's sort of like, you know, Dolly or something like that, and you don't use those names very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giza</span> plays an important role in your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Giza</span> plays an important role in my life.</sentence><sentence id="153">Well, Blanka does too in some sense because basically they lived sort of together.</sentence><sentence id="154">The family lived together.</sentence><sentence id="155">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">Giza was ten years, I'm sorry, fifteen years older than my mother.</sentence><sentence id="157">So, she often was sort of active as my mother's mother in they -- I see pictures that they had traveled together, for example, all three sisters to the <span class="DLF">seashore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">The middle sister got married fairly young and had two children, two daughters -- Zdenka and Vera.</sentence><sentence id="159">Their name was Appler, and the youngest -- the youngest daughter, my mother, was eventually sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cakovec</span> which is another small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, much larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> actually than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>, much closer even to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span>, and she went there to a teacher's -- a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's school</span>, became an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> teacher.</sentence><sentence id="160">The middle sister who was married, was married to Rudi Appler, who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>, opened a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, and that's -- and that's where they had two children.</sentence><sentence id="161">The oldest of the three, Giza, worked in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">Ludbreg Bank</span>, and there she met a person who was to play a large part in my life and that was Ludva Vrancic.</sentence><sentence id="162">Ljudevit is actually his real name.</sentence><sentence id="163">I'll get back to him.</sentence><sentence id="164">The brother Erne worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, worked early in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, and I'm not exactly sure what he did there.</sentence><sentence id="165">I think clerical work of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="166">I'm not sure of what he did.</sentence><sentence id="167">And the -- my mother eventually finished the <span class="BUILDING">teacher's school</span> and worked as a teacher in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> for a short period of time.</sentence><sentence id="168">Then my father and she met and married and left to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, and that's how I happened to have been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: So, let me ask you something, you were a very, very young child when the war came in 1941.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: So, what I need you to try to do is to distinguish what you've learned from other people and what you actually remember, because you were so little.</sentence><sentence id="191">So, if you can, as you speak, make that distinction, it might be very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="192">So, this is what my first question is for</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="199">you.</sentence><sentence id="200">What is your -- do you have any memories before 1941, before you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Images.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Images?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yes, I have in my head an image of my mother, but it's very hard to really tell because I was fortunate to have a lot of pictures of my parents, which I think a lot of children that lived through the Holocaust never got to have.</sentence><sentence id="206">And so it's very difficult because I've seen those pictures all my life.</sentence><sentence id="207">It's very difficult to really distinguish what's memory and what's a photograph that you have in your head.</sentence><sentence id="208">So, I think I have an image in my head, but I can't really tell you whether I do or don't.</sentence><sentence id="209">I think I have an image of myself leaving on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, because I left apparently when I was three years old.</sentence><sentence id="210">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> with friends of my grandparents and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>, and that happened before, just before, the war started, from what I understand.</sentence><sentence id="211">And, again, I don't have any idea whether -- because people often ask me whether I remember whether I was sent away because my parents were afraid of what's going to happen, or whether I was just going to visit my family just to visit my family or whether my mother, who already -- my brother had already been born, he was three years younger than I -- whether, you know, she said, you know, why not have this kid go away while she has a baby?</sentence><sentence id="212">I have no -- no idea why I was sent except there was an opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="213">These neighbors came and I went with them, and I don't remember being tearful or I don't remember the farewell.</sentence><sentence id="214">I don't remember any of that, but that was the last time I saw my parents.</sentence><sentence id="215">I don't remember any farewells.</sentence><sentence id="216">I remember sort of being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and there being fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: It was fun?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mm-hmm</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Was that the first time you were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Oh, I think so, probably.</sentence><sentence id="236">Well, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="237">It's very hard to tell.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Do you remember the birth of your brother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: You don't remember him as this tiny little baby?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="248">No.</sentence><sentence id="249">I mean, I remember him, however, when I do remember him very well is when he was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">That I remember.</sentence><sentence id="251">That I really do remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: So, were you told about your mother going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because clearly you were too young.</sentence><sentence id="258">Your mother wouldn't have explained to you that she was a teacher.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: No, none of that.</sentence><sentence id="265">I'm just saying the background of what really -- of what this family was all about, who was who.</sentence><sentence id="266">I have not the foggiest.</sentence><sentence id="267">No, of course not, because all of that happened before I was born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: What did your father do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: My father had apparently learned the trade of brushmaking, and had opened a <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span> to make brushes.</sentence><sentence id="275">From what I am told by his surviving brother, he was very good at it, and by the time that I was born, I can tell from, again, from the pictures of him, what people told me, there was a small workshop with, I don't know, ten or so workmen, and there was machinery and they made brushes and was very successful at it.</sentence><sentence id="276">But, I, again, don't have any memory of it.</sentence><sentence id="277">I only know pictures and stories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Is this difficult for you as an adult person thinking about who were these parents and what you have are paper pictures?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: It's not actually that difficult.</sentence><sentence id="285">The reason for it is that it was not a new discovery that I made as an adult.</sentence><sentence id="286">If I had known nothing of that, and all of a sudden as an adult it came upon me, yes, of course, it would have been difficult.</sentence><sentence id="287">But I grew up with all of that.</sentence><sentence id="288">It's -- it's just part and parcel of my growing up.</sentence><sentence id="289">I always heard stories and always knew who I was and I always had these pictures so that, you know, it's, you know, you just to grow up with stories.</sentence><sentence id="290">That's all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: So, you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludberg-</span></sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>, which actually has a meaning.</sentence><sentence id="301">The word "lud" in Croatian means crazy or mad.</sentence><sentence id="302">This is kind of crazy.</sentence><sentence id="303">And "breg", I think, means a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, but it also could be the words got transposed and it was "berg" which means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">So, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="305">Nobody ever explained why this is called that, but it's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you have a first memory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>?</sentence><sentence id="313">Remember arriving?</sentence><sentence id="314">You don't remember -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: No, I don't remember arriving.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: With your grandparents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: I remember very well being with my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="323">That I do remember, and again, I have certain images like I remember sitting with my grandfather in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and playing at his feet, and he was paralyzed already on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> because he had a stroke.</sentence><sentence id="324">And he was trying to pick up the toys that I was playing with, something like that, and he fell.</sentence><sentence id="325">It was a traumatic experience for me.</sentence><sentence id="326">So, I remember that, and I remember Hanukkah.</sentence><sentence id="327">I remember the-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: What happened after he fell?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Oh, someone came -- he couldn't pick himself up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: You just--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: I just remember that I was guilty of throwing the toys around or something.</sentence><sentence id="347">So, I remember being upset and crying.</sentence><sentence id="348">So, that's why I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="349">I remember Hanukkah for example, but not the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="350">I remember candles and I remember getting an orange, which was very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="351"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oranges</span> were not to be had.</sentence><sentence id="352">I remember at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>, or before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">I remember that they were burying silverware, and I thought that was a very strange thing to do, but that's apparently what can be done.</sentence><sentence id="354">I found that much later.</sentence><sentence id="355">I had no idea of that.</sentence><sentence id="356">I remember my grandfather sitting in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with all of us playing around and he used to -- he used to have his little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in front.</sentence><sentence id="357">This was, mind you, we were living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was attached to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and it was also -- and everything -- all the Jewish community matters played themselves out there.</sentence><sentence id="358">So, there was also the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there were some kind of classrooms, and, of course, that was there much later.</sentence><sentence id="359">It's been destroyed now, but -- so, he would sit in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and he had little piles of money in front of him and there were beggars that were sort of like professional beggars in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they would come Wednesdays and Saturdays because those were <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>, and on Saturdays, of course, he wouldn't do that, but -- that's Shabbat, but on Wednesdays they would sit and they would come and take their little piles.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: They, as far as you knew, they were specifically for these particular people?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="649">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mm-hmm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">Fairly early, they all left.</sentence><sentence id="651">I also know that my cousins, I know that now, that my favorite cousins with whom I stayed quite a bit of time and the middle aunt, Blanka, the middle aunt and her husband, that they had left for awhile and went to the Italian part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, that they were someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="652">And then there was a proclamation by Pavelic that people who had left, Jews who had left, should return, and if they return they will be spared, nothing will happen to them, and they stupidly returned.</sentence><sentence id="653">I have a very good friend of mine who still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="654">Her family, which was another family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> left also, and had left before this proclamation and they cleverly did not return.</sentence><sentence id="655">They were the only Jewish family, in fact, that returned after the war intact because they were smart enough not to return, actually because the mother in the family said she was absolutely not returning, and so they stayed with the Partisans in Partisan- held territory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kordun</span>.</sentence><sentence id="656">But, people who returned believing that this was going, you know, that they were going to be okay, they were gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Is it possible that it was -- there was a list, and people knew they were supposed to go so they didn't have to be rounded up, they went, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: I think somebody must have come and gotten them and had the list, and I -- I tried to reconstruct why I wasn't taken, and I hadn't thought about it before even toask my | with whom I eventually grew up, "Why wasn't I taken ever?"</sentence><sentence id="668">Besides having been hidden here and there, which I know I was, because people would warn us that there</sentence><sentence id="670">2 would be a raid.</sentence><sentence id="671">I have a feeling that I was not on the list.</sentence><sentence id="672">I had seen one of those lists.</sentence><sentence id="673">One of them is published in a book on Ludbreg, which I have, and it lists Ludbreg Jews, and my aunts are there, and everybody's listed, and I'm not on the list, neither is my brother.</sentence><sentence id="674">I have a feeling that the must have gotten the list maybe from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span>, and of course, I was not, since I was not born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> and I was not considered a, you know, a member of the Ludbreg Jews, I was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, I was not on that list.</sentence><sentence id="675">That's a possibility.</sentence><sentence id="676">But the other thing is that I know that many times we were warned that there would be a raid, and perhaps I -- if they had been warned, they would have hidden someplace, but I always wondered why in the world were they sitting there?</sentence><sentence id="677">Like sitting ducks.</sentence><sentence id="678">Even I -- I mean I didn't have a choice, of course, I was a child -- but I'm thinking, ""Why in the world were we there?"</sentence><sentence id="679">I recently, my aunt made a tape of her experiences-</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: So, is there some way in which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is protecting you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="751">A: It wasn't organized.</sentence><sentence id="752">Yeah, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="753">It wasn't an organized kind of thing, but a lot of people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were really Partisan sympathizers, and I know a number of people who lost, who perished, who lost their lives as Partisans during the war.</sentence><sentence id="754">People across the <span class="DLF">street</span> lost their one and only son.</sentence><sentence id="755">So, I think -- unwittingly, I mean, not in an organized manner, but it just was not a kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that would -- that would say, "Oh, well, go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else."</sentence><sentence id="756">Or, "You're endangering us."</sentence><sentence id="757">I was endangering some of these people, and -- but, they took us in anyway.</sentence><sentence id="758">So, but, anyway, our bad experiences during the war really had to do with the fighting, which everybody experienced, not just the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="759">Just there was only brother and I and my aunt that were left at the end.</sentence><sentence id="760">Because there were fights especially at night.</sentence><sentence id="761">There would be terrible fights.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: In the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="777">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="779">A: Yeah, oh yeah.</sentence><sentence id="780">There were -- the <span class="DLF">street</span> that I lived on was after the war called, "The Street of the 17" Udarna Brigada".</sentence><sentence id="781">1 don't know how to translate -- Brigade is Brigada, of course.</sentence><sentence id="782"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Udarna</span> means -- it's striking, one who can strike well, particularly well.</sentence><sentence id="783">And the reason it's called that is because the members of that brigade, the remnant of that brigade lost their lives.</sentence><sentence id="784">They killed themselves at the end of the battle in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was down my <span class="DLF">street</span> because they were totally surrounded.</sentence><sentence id="785">They had fought all night, and they were totally surrounded, and in the end, they just threw a bomb among themselves because they didn't want to be captured.</sentence><sentence id="786">But there were fights and we would spend -- we spent a lot of time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="787">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, not a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in an American sense.</sentence><sentence id="788">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">We had a <span class="DLF">vineyard</span>, and we had wine, and there were big barrels down there, and shelves and shelves full of apples that were there for the winter.</sentence><sentence id="790">And at one point, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> down there, rollaway <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="791">And we spent every night there because we knew that there would be bad fighting.</sentence><sentence id="792">Sometimes, but sometimes, we would forget to go down there on time, and -- not forget -- I'm sorry, we didn't know that we should go down there on time.</sentence><sentence id="793">So, then if a fight -- if a battle started, there was no way to get there because you had to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get -- to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and so it was too dangerous already to do that.</sentence><sentence id="794">So, we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: We -- yeah, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="814">That I remember very well.</sentence><sentence id="815">Sometimes the bullets were flying like crazy through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="816">There was one night, I won't forget, where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ours was a one-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they were shooting from our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="817">The bullets were flying through our <span class="DLF">windows</span>, and I was sleeping on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> in a corner.</sentence><sentence id="818">So, if you can imagine a corner and then <span class="DLF">window-window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">So, I was fairly well protected, but I was scared to death and I don't have any recollection of where my brother, but my aunt and uncle were sleeping in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and for some strange reason, I think</sentence><sentence id="821">4 everybody was kind of paralyzed that no one left there, but there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> that was -- that was right facing out from this <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and I remember crying and asking for somebody to come, and finally my uncle got up and came, and no sooner did he come to comfort me than a bullet landed on the pillow of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="822">He would've been killed if not for the fact that I had been crying.</sentence><sentence id="823">But in the morning sometimes, you looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> -- I remember one time it was a horrible battle, and we looked -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> you have these -- they're not shades in our sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="839">A: No, not even shutters.</sentence><sentence id="840">They're more like our Venetian blinds, but they are on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they are wooden, and you pull them up like that, but so, you can also turn them so that you can kind of peer out.</sentence><sentence id="841">I remember peering out, and that is a recollection I definitely have of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> going by our <span class="DLF">windows</span> full of dead -- nude, dead bodies because they had collected them and then just stripped them of clothes and were taking them someplace.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="863">Q: If you couldn't get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, would you lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so that you wouldn't be by a <span class="DLF">window</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Sometimes, yes, and we would sometimes also go into the side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that didn't have <span class="DLF">windows</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">There was one side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, except that one night that I remember so well, when we stupidly stayed where we shouldn't have stayed.</sentence><sentence id="867">I think sometimes it was so bad that nobody wanted to move.</sentence><sentence id="868">But most of the time, -- most of the -- it's very -- it's horrible, I hate to say that, but I remember being quite exhilarated by it all at times.</sentence><sentence id="869">I should have been -- instead of being afraid, I used to think it was sort of very exciting to have these battles going on, and thinking it was quite great fun to sleep down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where there were always some frogs jumping around.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="882">Q: Maybe as a child -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="884">A As a child, it is so much better.</sentence><sentence id="885">I mean, I'm sure the adults were totally, totally traumatized, but as a child, it's very interesting looking back, and I'm looking now at my granddaughter who is now about the age that I was at the end of the war, and I'm thinking, "Can you imagine what something like that would do to her?"</sentence><sentence id="886">And, yet, when I think of myself at the time, I don't think I was so horribly scared at many of the points.</sentence><sentence id="887">I was more -- I think there were some things that were just very scary, like seeing all these bodies going by.</sentence><sentence id="888">And there was a time that -- an image that I have very much in my head again, that was another thing that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">There were -- the <span class="BUILDING">Ustashe</span> would take people who were thought to be sympathizers of the Partisans, which they were, many of them, and if they -- sometimes they would catch them, some of them were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that includes my uncle, but my uncle who eventually married my aunt and he wasn't Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="890">I didn't explain that part, but at any rate, he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> at one point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span>, and they would take them either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sometimes they would hang them or kill them in some other way just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and I do have a very vivid image of going with one of our cleaning ladies to the main square and I wasn't supposed to see it.</sentence><sentence id="891">She was holding her hand on my eyes, but I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="892">There was a body hanging on every one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around the square, and I remember people saying -- they were -- because they were Partisans, that's why.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="902">Q: Now, when you saw something like that, and you saw the dead body, was that different for you then when you were in the midst of this fighting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="904">A: Well, yeah, that -- because the fighting was sort of like a "Star War" kind of thing like a game, and I didn't really -- I don't think I understood too well at the time what is the result of all this shooting, but I was scared to death when nobody was with me, and I cried a lot.</sentence><sentence id="905">So, there were times when I was very scared.</sentence><sentence id="906">But, we played war so much, you know, when I was a child, that's the game we played.</sentence><sentence id="907">You played -- you played with, like I remember playing with dried corn stalks.</sentence><sentence id="908">You would -- you know when they were cut off?</sentence><sentence id="909">And they were supposed to be fed to the cows, and we use those to battle each other in play war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="971">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: Sometimes, sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="974">There was an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> which belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and it was -- they just started building it, but they never finished building it.</sentence><sentence id="975">So, it was sort of empty, and you could hide <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there, and that's where we often played our games, and also in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> we had sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">It was built rather than a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">It was sort of attached to the structure, and in that structure we had a press for pressing grapes to get wine, and that was otherwise pretty empty.</sentence><sentence id="978">That was also a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to play.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="989">Q: This is the neighbor's.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: No, no, that belonged to the Vrancic family.</sentence><sentence id="992">The Vrancic family had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was built by my uncle's father, and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> when he was -- when that father was very young.</sentence><sentence id="993">So, it was in the mid-1800s.</sentence><sentence id="994">They were well educated and very old Croatian family.</sentence><sentence id="995">They count their ancestors to something like the 12" century where there were</sentence><sentence id="997">7 two famous Vrancic people.</sentence><sentence id="998">There was the Cardinal, and then there was an inventor, a fairly famous inventor by that name, and then the mother's family was called Svagel, and they were nobility, minor nobility, nevertheless, they had the PL, which is the approval of a in their name, and the silver has that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="999">And they established themselves in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they had a dozen children, none of whom survived who remarried.</sentence><sentence id="1000">They all died fairly young, not the children necessarily, some yes, but fairly -- sort of as teenagers or young people, and as my memory goes, there were only two survivors and they were already in their fairly old age.</sentence><sentence id="1001">One of them was Vika and the other was Ludva, and Vika remained single and died in the middle of the war, and I remember her quite well.</sentence><sentence id="1002">Ludva was the person who was extremely well-known in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1003">He was -- he had been a mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1004">He was a organizer of the <span class="BUILDING">sports club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1005">He was the organizer of -- he was the head of the soccer club even though he never played soccer.</sentence><sentence id="1006">He organized everything in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1007">He was especially having to do with music.</sentence><sentence id="1008">He loved music.</sentence><sentence id="1009">He played the violin.</sentence><sentence id="1010">He organized two different kinds of <span class="BUILDING">orchestras</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1011">He was the heart of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in terms of any kind of cultural life.</sentence><sentence id="1012">When he fell in love with my aunt, and he, of course, this was a Croatian Catholic family, and my aunt was the daughter of the rabbi, not exactly the right combination for the times, forever, but certainly not for that time.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And he was ten years older than she, and they knew each other especially from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> because he was a director of a part of another <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, and she worked there.</sentence><sentence id="1014">And, again, I know that only from stories.</sentence><sentence id="1015">I asked him many times afterwards, "So, why didn't you get married for such a long time?"</sentence><sentence id="1016">Because they got married in 1937, I think, or 1939, I'm not too sure.</sentence><sentence id="1017">I should know that, but anyway, and he always told me, "Well, she was very happy living with her family, with her parents, and I was fine living with my sister and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1018">There was no need to get married."</sentence><sentence id="1019">Well, I rather doubted that was how it was, but that's how he always said it.</sentence><sentence id="1020">But I'm sure that my grandparents did not -- were not thrilled their daughter going with a Catholic person.</sentence><sentence id="1021">However, in all the pictures of the family for a very long time, he's always present.</sentence><sentence id="1022">So, it wasn't like he wasn't accepted totally, and I think by the time the war was imminent in Europe, and they knew what was happening, they decided to get married.</sentence><sentence id="1023">So, they got married.</sentence><sentence id="1024">They actually had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to get married because you couldn't get married in a civil ceremony in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, that is, and neither of them was converting to anything.</sentence><sentence id="1025">So, they got married in a civil ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="1026">So, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we basically had lived was the <span class="BUILDING">Vrancic house</span>, and then they and my other aunt, the Appler family, decided to build a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of their own, but it was within the same compound, the same land base.</sentence><sentence id="1027">So, that's how we ended up having these two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were next to one another, and the other one was supposed to be a big two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> on the bottom for my uncle, a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the back, which is we ended up living and these people who often hid me lived there, and then there was supposed to be two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> upstairs, and that never got finished, of course, before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1077">A: Exactly, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="1078">So, I sort of have memories of Vika living by herself in that big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, in that one <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1079">We were living in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and I don't know at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> that was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1083">Q: So, it's confusing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1085">A: It's very confusing as to where I was living at what time because we did move around, but only within those three <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> sort of, and my grandfather, I think, I spent the least time there, and of course, I was the youngest so that I remember that the least, and I remember the <span class="BUILDING">Vrancic house</span> the best, because Vika eventually died during the war, and she died I think while my uncle was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and I remember seeing her dead, that was more scary than some of the battles because I ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and nobody told me she was dead and there she was.</sentence><sentence id="1086">But then once she died and was buried and we were always in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from then on, and that's, you know, I remember, that's -- we were set then in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from then on.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1158">0 A Well, he, yeah, he may have, but that's -- I think, in fact, he did, but there were people that they didn't want to -- that didn't allow them to be collected because people who were young and strong, they made them work.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I think that my -- Stricek remembers my father working with bricks, and carrying stones and bricks and things, but he was much, much younger.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Stricek at that point, he was born in 1885, he was old, and he had this family of people who were dying with weak lungs at a moment's notice, and he was -- he would have never made it.</sentence><sentence id="1161">So, anyway, at one point, they released that group and they all came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1178">A: Yes, at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, and I found out that that was -- that was very much a norm, that a lot of people especially those who were not Jews or Serbs, but were Croats who were just thought to be Partisan sympathizers and so on, that they were coming and going.</sentence><sentence id="1179">There are many testimonies that I have listened to now, and much material that I had seen, that people would say that they were released, and even Magda, we were talking to Magda.</sentence><sentence id="1180">She was saying how people were collected to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> and they were released to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and get their clothes or something, and it seems that while they were extremely cruel, within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span>, that they were also very disorganized, and sometimes people would come and go and they were constantly sending people from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="1181">I believe that was the most amazing thing that I found in reading the Jasenovac material, to what extent people were constantly being moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radiska</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.210556" long="16.035556">Lepoglava</span>, spending times on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going back and forth, sometimes being released.</sentence><sentence id="1182">It's amazing, and we haven't quite figured out.</sentence><sentence id="1183">Lucie and I are both very surprised, and we haven't quite figured out what is the basis of that except that we feel that there was not a total organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1360">Q: What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1362">A: What I remember most is columns and columns of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ustashe</span> being marched through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and being taken who knows where, and all of us standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looking at these people and these forced marches that they were on.</sentence><sentence id="1363">I don't know where they were going and to where they were going, and there wasn't anybody that knew, but everybody sort of standing around and these people were hungry and they were thirsty and here and there people gave them a little water, but other than that, people just stared as they were walking by, and so all of a sudden the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were reversed and everybody was saying, "They deserve it."</sentence><sentence id="1364">And that is what I remember most is this, you know, the conquered people walking by.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1368">Q: Were they yelling at them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1370">A: I don't remember yelling.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I think, in fact, there was quite a lot of silence, sort of, we were just staring at them.</sentence><sentence id="1372">There were huge number, there were thousands of people being marched by, what looked to me like thousands.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1382">Q: East?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1384">A: East.</sentence><sentence id="1385">So, because I mean, we were between -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludbreg</span> is between two larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.163306" long="16.830722">Koprivnica</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span>'s to the west, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.163306" long="16.830722">Koprivnica</span> to the east, and they were going across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.163306" long="16.830722">Koprivnica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1386">What happened after that, I don't know, but you know, that was --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1414">Q: Only Jewish Croats?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1416">A: Yes, I did not know any red heads, and so there was a time that Pavelic came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1417">I think it was towards the end sometime, I don't know exactly why he was invited -- he was a speaker.</sentence><sentence id="1418">Well, all my friends were going.</sentence><sentence id="1419">I wanted to go too, to see, and I was told absolutely not, and I remember that I was told I could look -- we had a <span class="DLF">stone fence</span>, and I could look across the <span class="DLF">stone fence</span>, peer out.</sentence><sentence id="1420">It was in the summertime I think, but I had to wear a hat on my head because you don't want any strangers not noticing you with this red hair, and my brother also had red hair.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: I was going to ask you if he had red hair.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: Yes, the two of us had red hair, and we kept waiting for someone in the family to have red hair, but my grandson has slightly reddish, but it's my -- the males in my family seem to have red beards, but I'm the only redhead female so far.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1430">Q: It was really flaming red?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1432">A: Yeah, very red hair yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1433">So, that was a real liability, and peasant women would come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and tell me horrible stories.</sentence><sentence id="1434">I remember one telling me, one time -- I don't know if it was during the war or not, but I remember she told me, "If you ever go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varazdin</span>", the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, "be very", or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, my goodness, ""be very careful not to go near any kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there is a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> because, you know, they might catch you and press you and make medicine out of you."</sentence><sentence id="1435">You know, there were -- in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, these kind of prejudices and misinformation are rampant.</sentence><sentence id="1436">So, I knew that my red hair was some kind of a liability and I was to hide it all times, and I hated it, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1442">Q: You didn't like it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1444">A: I did not like it at all.</sentence><sentence id="1445">I just hated it.</sentence><sentence id="1446">I felt like, "Okay, so maybe I'm redhead because I'm Jewish, I'm different."</sentence><sentence id="1447">And, I didn't like being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1448">I mean, it was a liability, and anyway, at that point, I really didn't know that Jewish was anyway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1461">Q: But, you knew Jewish was bad in terms of the Ustashe, not in terms of being Croatian, or could you not make that distinction?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1463">A: I don't think I could make that distinction.</sentence><sentence id="1464">Again, you know, I knew that this was something that they could catch me for and I would be in trouble, but no one told me, you know, no one told me why it was bad being Jewish, or why it was -- or maybe if they told me I did not understand or I didn't understand, but I just knew that nobody ever said bad things to me about it.</sentence><sentence id="1465">No one said, "Oh, you're a Jew, therefore" or "it's bad."</sentence><sentence id="1466">I mean I knew from being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">I just started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1468">I was, really, in first grade before the war, and we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday and we would line up and go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and I knew that I didn't know some of their songs.</sentence><sentence id="1469">I was inventing.</sentence><sentence id="1470">I remember inventing songs.</sentence><sentence id="1471">They would be singing something like, and I knew the melodies but I sometimes didn't know the words, and I would be inventing something about birds singing or something.</sentence><sentence id="1472">But, you know, I lived across from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and I'd go there with my friends.</sentence><sentence id="1473">And I knew very -- I knew very early that Jews -- that there were Jews who killed Jesus, and that that was bad, and I didn't want to be part of that.</sentence><sentence id="1474">But that's what I knew, and I didn't have any idea after the war what Jewish was, but of course, after the war, it didn't matter because nobody followed any religion after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1803">A: It makes sense.</sentence><sentence id="1804">The only time that I would, you know, feel sorry for myself, was when something would happen that I would get punished for something, and then I would say, "If my mother were alive she wouldn't do XYZ," you know, like I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1805">If we had succession of cleaning ladies and housekeepers.</sentence><sentence id="1806">We had some very nice housekeepers, some people who were very nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="1807">But if | would get punished or had to clean my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or whatever I had to do, I would say, "If my mother was alive, I wouldn't have to be doing this."</sentence><sentence id="1808">Of course, I would have.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1825">A: From what I was told by people -- a person who apparently witnessed my father's death, is that at the end -- at the end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasenovac</span>, there were many outbreaks.</sentence><sentence id="1826">There was a major one at one <span class="NPIP">point</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1827">I keep reading about that in all the records.</sentence><sentence id="1828">But, apparently, there was confusion and they were killing people en masse and so, people were trying to escape and there was -- it seems that my father and a few other people escaped at the very end, and that they went someplace into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and then came down -- came close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> looking for the food, and that they were surprised by a German, I think, German patrol, or Ustashe patrol, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="1829">And, then he was shot.</sentence><sentence id="1830">So, that's the most unfortunate, that he was able to survive until the very end, and then not make it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1844">Q: This is going to sound like an odd question, but do you think that if your parents had come back, you would have felt about them the way that you did about the two brothers who came?</sentence><sentence id="1845">Just like, "Who are you?"</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1874">Q: So, he's 45 or 50?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1876">A: In his 50s, right, and so -- oh, when did I feel sorry for myself for not have had my parents?</sentence><sentence id="1877">For example, he was fairly strict.</sentence><sentence id="1878">When I was a very little child, I could do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1879">I could climb <span class="DLF">walls</span> if I wanted to, but as I got older and older, then restrictions remained, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1880">I had to be careful about this and that, and boys and so on, and then I was always -- I would always say, "Well, you see, he's so old, he doesn't understand anything.</sentence><sentence id="1881">If I had younger parents, they would have understood."</sentence><sentence id="1882">Nonsense, of course, but, you know, that's -- it's a good way of looking at it.</sentence><sentence id="1883">So, I always used to say, "I'm going to have my children very young so that I'1l understand them better."</sentence><sentence id="1884">We'd have to ask my children how I did.</sentence><sentence id="1885">I did have my children very young, but I don't think that that was necessarily what happened, but I always worried about him getting married, for example.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1896">Q: And what would happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1898">A: And what would happen, and there was some possibilities.</sentence><sentence id="1899">We had some very appropriate housekeepers at times.</sentence></p></dialogue>
