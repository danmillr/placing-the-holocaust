was ringed by a moat and an armed barbed wire fence.</sentence><sentence id="384">So we got that close.</sentence><sentence id="385">We used our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> to smash the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: This was, the liberation was the 29"" of April at six PM, because when I went back later on several times, I was in a ceremony right at that moment when they -- But I was fortunate to be chosen among the few early the next morning to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">And I</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="411">Q: Where did you stay for that night?</sentence><sentence id="412">Do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: We still had to dig our <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the ground <span class="NPIP">outside</span> somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: And then the next morning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: It had been quite wet and lousy weather.</sentence><sentence id="418">Then suddenly the next day it was amazing cause the sun came up over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> and you could see all the snow there.</sentence><sentence id="419">Reminded us of being in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span>.</sentence><sentence id="420">The flat area and then suddenly seeing all of the snowy peaks.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="421">So some of us were allowed to go in, told we could but they didn't help us very much.</sentence><sentence id="422">So we just -- I got a ride I guess right to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and at that point they wouldn't let us in, at some --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="423">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 13 June 11, 2013 but then there was a Polish guy in our company, battery that spoke Polish to one of the survivors who opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span> for us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="424">And then we walked around.</sentence><sentence id="425">We counted 37 of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> full of dead bodies.</sentence><sentence id="426">They were, these were what the French used to call 40 and eight in the first war.</sentence><sentence id="427">They were made for 40, 40 men or eight horses.</sentence><sentence id="428">But actually they had something like 200 men in these.</sentence><sentence id="429">And the Germans had the -- Nazis -- the crazy idea that somehow if they moved all of the prisoners from other camps, that somehow they could congregate them there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">And the world wouldn't know what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="431">And the other crazy idea was that they would have a, do a last ditch stand in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="432">So that was the reason for sending people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="433">There were very, very few that made it.</sentence><sentence id="434">The ones that had gotten in that day were -- managed to get off.</sentence><sentence id="435">But there were only just a handful really that were still living on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">The ones that were lucky like a couple of my friends that I got to know later were sick enough so they were put into the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and that's what saved them.</sentence><sentence id="437">Because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> didn't come all the way in.</sentence><sentence id="438">Those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> did finally, most of the, a lot of them stopped a couple of miles away.</sentence><sentence id="439">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were broken down or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="440">And then they got, they had to march in with dogs and they would sometimes often shoot the ones that couldn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="441">At least the dogs were snapping at them.</sentence><sentence id="442">So--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: You are 21 years old and you see this, what you saw.</sentence><sentence id="444">Can you describe your thoughts, your feelings?</sentence><sentence id="445">As you say there's no preparation, no preparation.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: I think there were, there were two different things.</sentence><sentence id="447">It's hard to recollect what I thought but the first is the combat part, seeing, hiding from shells ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="448">Digging in <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> every night.</sentence><sentence id="449">Seeing the wounded and seeing prisoners coming out.</sentence><sentence id="450">That was the nice part, seeing releasing prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="451">But so the whole war time part was kind of in a different mode from the, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was a totally different thing cause we had no idea what, cause even though <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> had been released, we didn't get the news of that.</sentence><sentence id="453">We didn't really know much about it.</sentence><sentence id="454">It had been in the Stars and Stripes.</sentence><sentence id="455">Eisenhower had very gallantly I thought forced the local people to fill in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and do that.</sentence><sentence id="456">And even though it was, I'm not sure the dates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, early April I think.</sentence><sentence id="457">We didn't know about it.</sentence><sentence id="458">Stars and Stripes didn't get to us and they eventually of course did.</sentence><sentence id="459">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 14 June 11, 2013 But so we had the one thing was the whole combat part and the second was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="460">So the few of us that were lucky to get -- and not lucky, were fortunate I guess to get in there.</sentence><sentence id="461">We counted these awful 36 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail cars</span> and we were then taken down, toured them and there were I think 20 some <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, each originally for 200.</sentence><sentence id="462">Each one had about 2000 in it.</sentence><sentence id="463">They have still they kept one there as a souvenir and smashed the others.</sentence><sentence id="464">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when they knew we were close, the French particularly led a -- well what would have been a mutiny, headed by a French captain who later became a general and a friend of mine, he just died.</sentence><sentence id="465">He was the -- General Dapeche, head of the, at that point he was a captain.</sentence><sentence id="466">And what they decided to have a kind of a mutiny, kill their guards, but then turn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to us.</sentence><sentence id="467">And keep these distraught prisoners from killing every German in sight.</sentence><sentence id="468">So they did manage to do this, but at the end -- the German guards were all the worst.</sentence><sentence id="469">They were called kapos and these were German criminals who were told that in order to avoid <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or execution they would have to be guards at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="470">And they were really horrible people.</sentence><sentence id="471">And so at the end, we saw lots of their bodies.</sentence><sentence id="472">We didn't know where they had been killed by our troops who were just there the day before or whether they had been probably killed by the inmates.</sentence><sentence id="473">Anyway by the time we were there, we were led down and saw the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> where it had been decided to go ahead and, by the Polish prisoners doing it, were ordered to keep on using it because they had to do something with all the bodies from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="474">And then the others who had died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: Well again, as a 21 year old, seeing this, not only the sights but the evil that you were -- again do you have any memories of what went through your mind?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="507">A: I think if you think of some of the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="508">I mean many I talked to later and became close friends with, they were men who were originally say 200 pounds were down to about 80 pounds and they were just skeletons.</sentence><sentence id="509">Our first instinct was to hand out food and candy and we were told not to because their bodies couldn't take it and as soon as our officers got in there, we were told to get out because they didn't want us to get typhus.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: Did any of the prisoners come up and try to talk to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="517">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 15 June 11, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: Oh yes, oh my gosh.</sentence><sentence id="519">They came up and hugged us and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="520">At that point we didn't have all these restrictions and our doctors hadn't gotten there to get us out and the other thing was that we weren't supposed to be there very long.</sentence><sentence id="521">As soon as we had this little tour, they said to hurry up.</sentence><sentence id="522">We had to go continue to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="523">So it wasn't as if our particular divisions stayed very long.</sentence><sentence id="524">Certainly the 20" armored didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="532">Q: When they came up to you, how did you respond?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: Well they came and hugged us.</sentence><sentence id="535">Really and, and I was able to speaking French, to talk with a lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="536">The French prisoners were a little bit better shape because most of them had only been there nine months.</sentence><sentence id="537">Some of the Germans had been there since 1933.</sentence><sentence id="538">It was an enormous mixture of people.</sentence><sentence id="539">To our surprise we learned later that only 16 percent were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="540">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is, to go back, as you probably know but in, back in 33, it was German Protestants originally.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="541">Various other kinds of anarchists, people that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: Political --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: Yeah political ones.</sentence><sentence id="544">And then the really enormous increase came after the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="545">And that was the worst horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="546">They had about 4000 Russian prisoners and they still celebrate it or celebrated that.</sentence><sentence id="547">And they were all told at one point to race down in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">And if they got down to the other <span class="NPIP">end</span>, they would be free.</sentence><sentence id="549">And they were all shot in the back.</sentence><sentence id="550">But when we got there the melange of people, it was a little hard to make out.</sentence><sentence id="551">But mostly were <span class="REGION">Eastern European</span>.</sentence><sentence id="552">And the ones in better shape though were the French, because most of the French had been in the French resistance and when we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, what they tried to do was to turn over their respective <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> to us.</sentence><sentence id="553">And many of them got caught doing it by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="554">They were too eager.</sentence><sentence id="555">So they were then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="556">But because of that, they had only been there nine months compared to the longer periods of most of the others, and particularly the Eastern Europeans.</sentence><sentence id="557">And they were the ones that had sort of organized this sort of mutiny to turn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="573">Q: What were the reactions of the other young men in your --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="575">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 16 June 11, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Well I think we all had the same reaction pretty much.</sentence><sentence id="577">The curious thing, there were really very few from the 20" armored.</sentence><sentence id="578">Just as we were invited into what they called combat command.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="579">And combat command B which we were in, only had our -- we were the only artillery part of that.</sentence><sentence id="580">There was a very small part of our division and that was just by a fluke because the division was headed south and three quarters of it were after the SS and going straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="581">So it just happened that we were on the right flank.</sentence><sentence id="582">And then at the same time, after we had used our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> to open up the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and all, then you had the, both the 42"4 and 45" division that came in, in strong numbers.</sentence><sentence id="583">And that became a kind of a hassle later on because there were two colonels, one from each division that each thought that they got there first.</sentence><sentence id="584">And then Marguerite Higgins who was the first correspondent who came from the Tribune, and she rode in and I think it was the 45" and they claimed to be the first there.</sentence><sentence id="585">And so did the 42"4.</sentence><sentence id="586">We got very little credit for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="587">When I went back in 1940, 95, for the 50", there were only three of us from the 20" armored who sort of hooked on.</sentence><sentence id="588">My great, close Princeton roommate that I went back with who had been in the same outfit who has since died, he and I and one other guy that turned up, piggy backed on.</sentence><sentence id="589">The 42" division really ran the reunion.</sentence><sentence id="590">There was a German American who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> who did all of the work so we found out about it and hooked on to them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="591">So we got in to all of that, that way.</sentence><sentence id="592">But they were still arguing about who got there first and who did what.</sentence><sentence id="593">But I was able then, because I knew the ambassador and the counsel general, to get them to agree.</sentence><sentence id="594">They had no problem with this, that there would be a plaque for the 20" armored as well as the other two that already had it.</sentence><sentence id="595">And that took a while to get through and eventually we put the big plaque up and I actually sort of inaugurated it when I went back in 2010, right at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> where it says Arbeit Frei, the main <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="596">So that was all a sort of an ancillary part of this but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="597">Q: Did the officers while you were inside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, did the come over -- the American, your officers -- did they say anything special to you about what you're looking at, witnessing?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="598">A: No, because they were just as -- I think they were just as shocked as we were.</sentence><sentence id="599">When people walked around, nobody really cared and if people hugged us they didn't care whether we were officers or not and I don't' even remember when we walked around, some of us, I don't' think</sentence></p><p><sentence id="600">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 17 June 11, 2013 we hardly walked around with any officers that I can remember.</sentence><sentence id="601">We went to this <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and then we kept talking to the prisoners all the way and then we were taken up to the big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the SS had had its <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="602">They were all gone.</sentence><sentence id="603">Maybe they had been shot or they mostly had fled.</sentence><sentence id="604">And that's where for example, I picked up that Nazi flag that the officer, and some other souvenirs like that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="605">But anyway we weren't, I mean all this took about two hours of running around and then after that we had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="606">So that was our initial feeling about it, as much as you could have.</sentence><sentence id="607">And then we went right ahead and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: When you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you and the other young men talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: Oh yeah and I had pictures but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="610">I didn't really keep those.</sentence><sentence id="611">Oh yeah we were all shocked but then we went on and we thought there'd be a big battle over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="612">There really wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="613">It was declared an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> just before that so we drove right through it and it was very, mostly a smashed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> but there wasn't any fighting to speak of there.</sentence><sentence id="614">And then we headed towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="615">And we had some, a couple of big battles there.</sentence><sentence id="616">But then the Germans, several days before the war end, began to give up and then we had these tremendous <span class="DLF">lines</span> of prisoners.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="617">Another guy and I were, we sort of fanned out as we went and we ended up taking a bunch of prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="618">And as we were heading between there and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>, a couple of days before the war ended, we saw the, all of the Hitler Youth walking toward us from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the previous post was.</sentence><sentence id="619">And I'm sure we passed his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldhausen</span> or something, his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, cause we saw these kids and we just made sure they were disarmed and just told them to keep walking.</sentence><sentence id="620">We didn't know what do with them.</sentence><sentence id="621">So anyway we drove down and about two days before the end of the war, we were told to stop briefly and no more firing.</sentence><sentence id="622">But keep taking prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="623">And we did and then so finally we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> on May eighth.</sentence><sentence id="624">And it was a different, second armored division which were -- we were all clothed in American uniforms and everything else, except for the French thing on the shoulder, converged with us.</sentence><sentence id="625">And that was a lot of fun for me because I was able to speak and they had liberated a <span class="BUILDING">champagne factory</span> and killed a lot of chickens.</sentence><sentence id="626">So we celebrated V-E day together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="628">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 18 June 11, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="629">Q: When you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and were moving along and you saw Germans, did you have any feeling of anger towards them after what you had seen?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: Yeah, we certainly did.</sentence><sentence id="631">I mean at that point we weren't going to go kill anybody but I mean we certainly -- it was more disgust, yes completely.</sentence><sentence id="632">They would do it and then some of these poor soldiers, it was quite clear probably later than then that they were sort of poor Hungarians who had been drafted in this and that kind of a third rate soldiers just thrown into the Wehrmacht at the end.</sentence><sentence id="633">So I don't think any of us thought much about it.</sentence><sentence id="634">We just kept taking prisoners and disarming them.</sentence><sentence id="635">Told them to keep walking, pretty much is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="636">Then a weird thing happened right after that.</sentence><sentence id="637">Our 20" <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored division</span> was told to go after Tito.</sentence><sentence id="638">This was absolutely crazy because it meant driving over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> on a narrow <span class="DLF">road</span> where over these tiny <span class="DLF">bridges</span> where any one <span class="DLF">bridge</span> could have stopped our whole progress.</sentence><sentence id="639">So we got all the way up kind of to the divide over <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, I guess it was, and were told to stop.</sentence><sentence id="640">So we were way up there.</sentence><sentence id="641">I remember climbing the highest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> with some friends, the Dochstein and it was a kind of a little <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="642">So we sat there for about two weeks and had a great time and then we were told to come back down again so we came back down and were parked by the Chiemsee a wonderful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> which later became a kind of an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American rest camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="643">So we hung around there for quite a while and that was fun.</sentence><sentence id="644">And then we were spread out to different <span

id="1457">Q: What are your thoughts about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1458">A: Well it's, it took me a long time to get very enthusiastic about Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1459">Maybe it was a little bit my father that was in both wars and felt the same way pretty much.</sentence><sentence id="1460">But and I learned a little bit of German here and there.</sentence><sentence id="1461">And then but one interesting thing I hadn't mentioned but I will quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1462">At that first one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">95</span>, I sat next to a German general at a big dinner the night before.</sentence><sentence id="1463">He was the head of the medical department.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And that was quite a dinner that I did get into or some of us did.</sentence><sentence id="1465">Anyway he asked if I would talk to his medical students men and women, about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1466">I said yes, of course I would.</sentence><sentence id="1467">So I by that time, the next day or something we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> for a little thing.</sentence><sentence id="1468">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back.</sentence><sentence id="1469">And a day or two later a German colonel that made the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which still struck me as odd, took me out and had lunch at the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> with about 25 officers and they brought up, that was kind of bizarre.</sentence><sentence id="1470">They found a kid of my age, then age, 21.</sentence><sentence id="1471">A private in the German army, kind of made him sit there to see what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="1472">That was a little bizarre.</sentence><sentence id="1473">But they were all very nice and they were all, some had been also in NATO fans.</sentence><sentence id="1474">We had given a big award to this German general, his medical thing.</sentence><sentence id="1475">So at the lunch he invited me to go into this <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> where there were about a hundred medical students, boys and girls in their 20s I guess.</sentence><sentence id="1476">And he said that they had almost all spoke English.</sentence><sentence id="1477">Well I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I spoke in English obviously and fairly slowly and I told them all about my experience.</sentence><sentence id="1479">And got a standing ovation at the end.</sentence><sentence id="1480">I don't know how much they got out of it but it was fascinating to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1481">On the way back from this last time on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lufthansa</span>, I sat next to a German general of all things.</sentence><sentence id="1482">And he was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1483">After all, as you've said you get used to the fact that they are our allies and that and I made a point in my speech everywhere for and there that, particularly that we were all, this would never happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And that it's there somewhere, anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1485">We're all allies and that we would all together believe in the slogan of never again.</sentence><sentence id="1486">And I complimented him on the Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 34 June 11, 2013 fact that at all of these events, they brought in all kinds of <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span> and college kids.</sentence><sentence id="1487">And I'd say most of the crowd there in 2010 were Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Well maybe half German and half survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1489">It was hard to tell, a couple of thousand people there.</sentence><sentence id="1490">But now they have a wonderful ladies, German ladies that run the new <span class="BUILDING">welcome center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And they were the ones that I dealt with beforehand and got on the program.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And they were very worried.</sentence><sentence id="1493">It was funny.</sentence><sentence id="1494">Ahead of time, that the initial rivalry between the three divisions would make it odd.</sentence><sentence id="1495">I represented all American troops unless I get a clearance from the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">divisions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1496">So I did.</sentence><sentence id="1497">I knew the guys in each one.</sentence><sentence id="1498">I called up and said look I'm going to be back there.</sentence><sentence id="1499">And I just speaking for the 20".</sentence><sentence id="1500">I happen to be -- all of us who were there in 45.</sentence><sentence id="1501">Do you mind?</sentence><sentence id="1502">Oh no, no that's fine.</sentence><sentence id="1503">You can represent us.</sentence><sentence id="1504">They were -- track them down.</sentence><sentence id="1505">One from each division somewhere in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1506">And but it's funny that the German organizers were afraid that somehow this would come up, that if I spoke -- anyway we cleared all that.</sentence><sentence id="1507">But so I think enough time has gone by so that anybody that was there at all and still living -- cause an awful lot have died.</sentence><sentence id="1508">But I certainly got into this because at the end I became president of the retirees of the 20" armored division.</sentence><sentence id="1509">I did that for about five years.</sentence><sentence id="1510">I organized several of our reunions and the biggest one was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span>, just before this, actually the same year, 2010.</sentence><sentence id="1511">And that's -- they had one more we didn't get to and now they're going to -- they wanted to go back and have a final one at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Hamilton</span> Kentucky.</sentence><sentence id="1512">I'm not sure I want to go back there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1572">And there was a funny reaction to that.</sentence><sentence id="1573">The people who hadn't seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> didn't seem to care about it.</sentence><sentence id="1574">I mean it was weird because that was only a very --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1575">Q: You mean the people who hadn't been there initially?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1576">A: In our division.</sentence><sentence id="1577">There were really very few had, who had and the others were, had lots of other war stories and about taking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and all that but they didn't --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1578">Q: They were not physically in --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1579">Interview with Alan Wood Lukens 35 June 11, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1580">A: They had never seen it and weren't particularly shocked by it until they -- so I didn't make a big point but I told them what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1581">It was kind of curious.</sentence><sentence id="1582">But and I didn't, I criticized the other people, maybe as a contrast that I had such a fascinating career afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1583">To some of them, this was not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> but the fact of being in the 20", and in the war was probably the -- I don't mean to sound disparaging but the biggest thing in their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1584">They went back to their small <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they lived and brought up and that was fine.</sentence><sentence id="1585">That wasn't true of all of them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1586">There was one guy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tucson</span> when we had our thing there, that he had done a lot of speaking and he had -- he just died.</sentence><sentence id="1587">He was a very good man and we went, at our reunion there.</sentence><sentence id="1588">He rallied around and found all of the survivors and a number of Holocaust who were Jewish refugees and people so that was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1589">So it didn't apply to everybody but I would say to some that it was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was not, except for those of us who saw it, was not the main --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1590">Q: When you meet survivors, do you automatically tell them that you were in the army and you were --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1591">A: Well yeah I'm not pushing it at them but if they ask and so on, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
