<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Okay, for the record give us your name and a little bit about your early background?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Herbert Friedman.</sentence><sentence id="6">And my early background is really very simple.</sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> in 1918.</sentence><sentence id="8">My father had migrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, my mother from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, good stock.</sentence><sentence id="9">The two of them, they met and married in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> I think it was, and that's where I grew up.</sentence><sentence id="10">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there, I went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there, and graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="11">Two brothers, both of whom are still living.</sentence><sentence id="12">A strong, tight, good Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="13">Conservative congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">Quite modern in those days, from my parents, men and women sitting together, organ in the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="15">The Rabbi, a wonderful person, himself Vilna-born, but took a Ph.D. at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, writing three volumes of the history of the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in English.</sentence><sentence id="16">I mean that was a man, good brain, good human being, and working in this small middle class ordinary congregation, nothing famous about him, but very impressive to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What was your awareness of the rise of Hitler as you were growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well, that's the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="32">The whole story of my life revolves around that.</sentence><sentence id="33">In <span class="BUILDING">college</span> between the years of 1934 to "38, formative years, fully cognizant of what was happening, as fully as anybody could be who watched carefully.</sentence><sentence id="34">The argument that people didn't know what was going on in those days has never never seemed valid to me because you could read it in the New York Times.</sentence><sentence id="35">1 did.</sentence><sentence id="36">If I did, others did.</sentence><sentence id="37">But at any rate, it bothered me when I looked around "34, "35, "36, in "36 the Nuremberg laws were passed.</sentence><sentence id="38">It was quite clear what the intent was.</sentence><sentence id="39">Hitler's book was out.</sentence><sentence id="40">He had been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, he wrote it there back in 1925.</sentence><sentence id="41">The book was available to be read.</sentence><sentence id="42">I read parts of it.</sentence><sentence id="43">It's turgid writing, it's not easy, Mein Kampf, but never mind you've got the picture.</sentence><sentence id="44">So that I could not understand the silence of the whole American Jewish Community around me.</sentence><sentence id="45">I did understand some of the politics.</sentence><sentence id="46">There was a difference quite clear in those days between the "Ost-Juden," the Russian-Polish Jews and the German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="47">The American Jewish Committee was in correspondence with people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> who were advising them quiet, don't raise a fuss, you'll make it worse, don't organize protests, no, don't listen to Stephen Wise, don't have a parade down <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>, and they were attracted by that kind of advice, they were even enchanted by it.</sentence><sentence id="48">It gave them a perfect rationalization.</sentence><sentence id="49">Now, there not the only villain in the piece, everybody latched on to that.</sentence><sentence id="50">So I don't want to be misunderstood about the American Jewish Committee only or specifically.</sentence><sentence id="51">The mood was (a) we're not sure of what's happening, (b) it can't be as bad as some people are saying it is, (c) what can we do about it anyhow, and (d) the American Government isn't disturbed, and Franklin Roosevelt is a great friend of the Jews and he isn't upset.</sentence><sentence id="52">Nobody is upset.</sentence><sentence id="53">All of these factors seemed to me to be leading to a dreadful conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="54">So on the specific point of how I was reacting in terms of what I saw around me, I was getting more and more furious, that's a worthwhile word, and frustrated and that was the condition that I felt I was in when I was 19 years old and had graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: You graduated as a young man?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Young, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: And then what did you decide to do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Well, don't forget we were at the tail end of the Depression, and a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by the name of Samuel Leidesdorf, a big accounting firm, and a major factor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, UJA -- well, it wasn't yet the UJA, it was the Palestine Appeal, said to me I'll give you a job as an accountant for $25.00 a week if you'll go to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia Business School</span> and learn accounting.</sentence><sentence id="86">So, okay, $25.00 a week, and so I went to Columbia Graduate School of Business, stayed one year, couldn't stand it for another day, couldn't dream of myself as being an accountant, so I quit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: $25.00 --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: A week.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: -- was the equivalent today of what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: Oh, gosh, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="96">30 times that amount, $700.00, $800.00 a week.</sentence><sentence id="97">A very good job.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: So it was a nice starting salary?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Oh, yes, a nice starting salary, perfectly acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="104">Tuition was $450.00 at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">Today it's $23,500.00.</sentence><sentence id="106">So that there I was, I was at the end, I owed money to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, I owed money to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and it's now 1939, the war has not yet broken out in Europe but it's imminent, and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is in a totally isolationist mood, no thought of participating in it.</sentence><sentence id="107">Roosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making these funny deals called lend/lease, we will lend you some of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">destroyers</span> on lease, you will pay us rent for our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">destroyers</span>, but we're not going to get into your war.</sentence><sentence id="108">So it was really so ambivalent and so confused and so costly in the long run.</sentence><sentence id="109">At any rate my personal requirements were that I had better go and get a job.</sentence><sentence id="110">So I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> and got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> working at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> making blankets.</sentence><sentence id="111">I worked two shifts, 16 hours a day, and I earned enough money to pay back all the debts.</sentence><sentence id="112">And I also did the most important thing at that stage in my life, I decided what I really wanted to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: Which was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: I tried to figure out during all those mindless hours at the machine where all you're trying to do is keep your hand away from the needle which you're just feeding cloth through and it's robot work, and I said why should I continue being so frustrated.</sentence><sentence id="126">If the American Jewish Community isn't awake why don't I try to awaken them, but how do you do that.</sentence><sentence id="127">That's when I decided that I would become a rabbi, not because of any theological sudden insights, I had no epiphanies, I had no -- I conceived of myself really as a civil servant.</sentence><sentence id="128">And if I had a <span class="DLF">platform</span> from which to speak I would use that <span class="DLF">platform</span> to try to wake people up.</sentence><sentence id="129">It was sort of simplistic, very idealistic, but satisfying to me.</sentence><sentence id="130">On the other hand, again I felt I'm stopping myself for at least three years from getting into any action mode and yet I'd better do that or else I'll be frustrated the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="131">So I finished with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, backed off, went to <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical seminary</span> with Stephen Wise in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and we did four year's worth of work in three, no summer vacations, no nothing, 11-1/2 months you worked, two weeks off, and kept going that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: What was the mood in <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical school</span>, were students preparing for a career, was there a sense of --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Well, Wise being the person he was and focused the way he was, every one of the students in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became acutely sensitized to the current events around us.</sentence><sentence id="142">So, sure, everybody was preparing for a career, you needed to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> or a job somewhere to earn your living, but the ideology was developing among this group before the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> merged with the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Union College</span> out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">It graduated about 220 reform rabbis, but reform rabbis of a totally different kind than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> was producing.</sentence><sentence id="144">I sat for all those years next to a fellow by the name of Osher Krishblu- (e or m?)</sentence><sentence id="145">who later became the Chairman of the Misrachi, and he sat with his kippa and I sat without a kippa and the whole faculty liked it that way and Wise liked it that way, and the dean, Henry Slominski liked it that way, it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in which "Klal Israel" or pluralism or whatever word you want to use, which is so fashionable today, was really being practiced in the "30s and "40s, the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in which it was being carried out as a definite ideological objective, and every student picked it up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Tell us a little bit about Stephen Wise, his <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, what was his role in this, what was his role in the American Jewish Community at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, his role in the American Jewish Community was superb.</sentence><sentence id="154">He was the leader of the protest, the ceaseless effort to try to persuade Roosevelt, to whom he had automatic access, Rabbi Stephen Wise was acceptable to Roosevelt at request, and saw him frequently.</sentence><sentence id="155">He failed to convince him of anything, but Wise was the pusher, Wise was the aggressor seeking to have a large protest meeting in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span>, and we'll get 25,000 people there or 20,000 whatever the <span class="BUILDING">Garden</span> holds.</sentence><sentence id="156">And he filled it every time, talking about the fact we must do something.</sentence><sentence id="157">He sounded -- he was the only one who sounded the tocsin, the call, he was the bugle.</sentence><sentence id="158">Almost no response except in those of us who were listening to him very very carefully and very closely.</sentence><sentence id="159">I adored him, I admired him, I respected him.</sentence><sentence id="160">The personal impact used to come on Thursday mornings.</sentence><sentence id="161">Thursday morning he had a class called problems of the ministry.</sentence><sentence id="162">A big round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seminar table</span>, 18, 12 students around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">And problems of the ministry or how do you conduct a wedding how do you conduct a funeral?</sentence><sentence id="164">Nothing of the sort.</sentence><sentence id="165">He would go into his pocket, he would take out the latest telegram that he got from the World Jewish Congress, Riegner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, and because he was a key player in the World Jewish Congress he started the American Jewish Congress, he believed in Democracy and he had hoped that those organizations would really be democratic in the sense every member would vote for its officiers.</sentence><sentence id="166">It never happened that way in practice, but in theory it was at that time the most democratic, and still to this day the most liberal organization I think in existence in the panoply of our alphabet soup.</sentence><sentence id="167">So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was the latest stuff going on in Europe in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, or this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or another.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: So you were with him in the period of "39 through --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: "39 to "43.</sentence><sentence id="186">I left in "43.</sentence><sentence id="187">I graduated, I went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> to take a --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Did you know of the existence of Riegner telegram?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="194">We students knew it.</sentence><sentence id="195">He read it to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: And what was the its impact?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: On us?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Devastating and confirming.</sentence><sentence id="206">It confirmed us in our desire, because I wasn't the only one who felt this frustrated and who wanted to get out there and try to wake up -- so we were getting confirmation to our own personal feelings from him.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I think that if he felt that he was failing to arouse the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">He was succeeding in arousing us.</sentence><sentence id="209">That was, I think, the greater of two contributions which he made.</sentence><sentence id="210">And we were champing at the bit.</sentence><sentence id="211">And so many of us in those classes spent the one year which the Army required for you to go and be an intern, that is by medical metaphor.</sentence><sentence id="212">You graduated <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, now be an intern in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a year, and then we will take you into the Army and we'll commission you as a medical officer.</sentence><sentence id="213">The same with clergymen.,</sentence><sentence id="214">go out, get your <span class="BUILDING">congregational</span> experience, what good that was going to do you in the Army I have no idea, but that was their bureaucracy.</sentence><sentence id="215">And so each of us was impatient to get out, get the congregational job, spend the year and then get into the chaplaincy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Let me focus for a moment on the Riegner telegram.</sentence><sentence id="228">Do you remember when you heard the Riegner telegram --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, it was in "42.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: -- August of "42?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Aug. "42.</sentence><sentence id="235">I didn't remember which month exactly.</sentence><sentence id="236">Well, so then it would have been a week or two weeks thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="237">Remember I said <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was continuous, there were no summer vacations.</sentence><sentence id="238">So let's call it -- yes, it was before Rosh Hashanah.</sentence><sentence id="239">Yes I remember it now.</sentence><sentence id="240">So I can't tell you the exact date, but we all used it in sermons that we made.</sentence><sentence id="241">I used it.</sentence><sentence id="242">1remember I used it.</sentence><sentence id="243">But who was listening to us.</sentence><sentence id="244">I mean we didn't make any ripples.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="256">Students make any ripples out in the big world.</sentence><sentence id="257">And if you were a student-Raggi at -- where was I?</sentence><sentence id="258">It was a place in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">So you're talking to one group of people and you're reading this telegram to them and you're saying wake up, wake up.</sentence><sentence id="260">The impact was quite limited, quite personal.</sentence><sentence id="261">And, you know, the Riegner telegram of 1942 became such a big sensation later as proof that we had evidence and everybody chose to bury it.</sentence><sentence id="262">Wyman in his book talks about the fact that the State Department didn't want it transmitted to anybody, they wanted it just kept secret.</sentence><sentence id="263">They were afraid of what impact it would make and so indeed it didn't make any for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="264">But Wise had it.</sentence><sentence id="265">We his students had it.</sentence><sentence id="266">We tried to get it out.</sentence><sentence id="267">I don't know when it hit the press.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: How did Wise see his own role?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: I don't think he stood still long enough to see his own role.</sentence><sentence id="283">He was in constant motion.</sentence><sentence id="284">He was in furious motion.</sentence><sentence id="285">And the fact that he would meet us every Thursday morning at 11:00 o'clock week after week after week, year after year meant that that was a holy moment for him, a crucial moment.</sentence><sentence id="286">If you can transmit something to your students then at least your mortality becomes less important.</sentence><sentence id="287">If you can't transmit anything to anybody and it's all bottled up in you, then it's dreadful that you are going to die with that.</sentence><sentence id="288">But he never had a sense of dying.</sentence><sentence id="289">He was vigorous and always moving, speaking out ....Listen, he was the prime spokesman to the non Jewish world not just to the Jewish world.</sentence><sentence id="290">In the first half of the 20th century every clergyman in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> knew the name of Stephen Wise.</sentence><sentence id="291">And so his satisfactions came from that.</sentence><sentence id="292">Toward the end he developed cancer in the throat and died in "49 never having set foot on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel.</sentence><sentence id="293">At the very end I remember seeing him once and he said that was the greatest tragedy of his life.</sentence><sentence id="294">He spent his whole life working for the cause of Zionism and when it reached its fruition he never had the joy and the glory of setting foot on that soil.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Let's go back to "42.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: You then finished -- this was the Jewish Institute of Religion?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Jewish Institute of Religion in New York.</sentence><sentence id="315">Later after he died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span>, I think it was still Nelson Glick who was the president out there, came and pushed for the merger.</sentence><sentence id="316">Some of us fought against the merger.</sentence><sentence id="317">We had a different conception of what the reform movement was then they did.</sentence><sentence id="318">Rabbi Morton Berman of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, I remember, and Rabbi Philip Bernstein of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>, those were two of my very close friends.</sentence><sentence id="319">They were a few years ahead of me, a few years older than I was, but still we became very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="320">We fought the merger unsuccessfully, because Wise dead and no fund-raising -- he was the prime fund-raiser, he kept it going.</sentence><sentence id="321">So the merger took place.</sentence><sentence id="322">We scattered.</sentence><sentence id="323">I left.</sentence><sentence id="324">I was graduated and went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> in "43.</sentence><sentence id="325">Wise said to me, you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">Wise used to think that if he could place a man in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> somewhere that he would then have a right to go to that man and to do some fund-raising in that congregation in support of the alma mater, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to.</sentence><sentence id="327">So he was always desperately seeking good <span class="BUILDING">congregational placements</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">Well, this was a congregation out there that had a thousand family memberships in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="329">The congregation was older than the State of Colorado.</sentence><sentence id="330"><span class="REGION">Colorado</span> came into the Union in 1876.</sentence><sentence id="331">Centennial State, that's the name of the book Centennial that what's his name wrote, Michener.</sentence><sentence id="332">The congregation was 1874.</sentence><sentence id="333">It was started by Simon Guggenheim, later Senator Guggenheim, American Mining and Smelting Company, a powerful, big German classical reform (Temple).</sentence><sentence id="334">So Wise pushed me as, I guess one of his favorite sons, into that congregation.</sentence><sentence id="335">Stay there and we'll always then have a foot in the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: You went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>, what happened then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Well, I had a lovely year there, fighting hard with the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="361">Their previous rabbi, also named Friedman, had been there for 50 years and taught then anti-Zionism, anti- Hebrew, anti-Bar Mitzvah, anti-Oriental ceremonials like putting on a hat, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="362">50 years, two generations, I couldn't dream of upsetting that in one year, but I got close to it, split the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="363">I said why don't you guys go off and be homogeneous in your anti-Zionism, I'm going to take this congregation and turn it around.</sentence><sentence id="364">So you're going to be listening to stuff that's going to irritate you, and your presence out there in front is going to irritate me, so take a Safer Torah and goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="365">Today <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> has two big, big strong <span class="BUILDING">reform temples</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">The anti group has long since come back.</sentence><sentence id="367">So I think I did a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="368">That was the year.</sentence><sentence id="369">And then I went to the Army.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Let's talk for a little bit about the American Jewish Community at that point from the vantage point of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">You've already mentioned one division between Zionism and non Zionism.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2020">A: He received permission to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit and work in the <span class="BUILDING">Offenbach depot</span> of approximately 3,000,000 volumes which Rosenberg had collected.</sentence><sentence id="2021">The intent of which was to form a basic library of Judaica which German scholars would study and find in the very Jewish sources the words with which to condemn the Jewish people as being parasites and destroyers and anti-Christ and everything else so that you would condemn the Jewish people out of their very own mouths.</sentence><sentence id="2022">What came out of their mouths would condemn them.</sentence><sentence id="2023">But somebody had to find it and collate it and synthesize it into one simple volume that then would become the property of every single decent person on earth.</sentence><sentence id="2024">And after we have killed their bodies we will then also kill their soul and their spirit.</sentence><sentence id="2025">So this was the intention of Alfred Rosenberg and this was the process.</sentence><sentence id="2026">Now, what was collected, literally actually collected physically, in that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> were mostly claye kodesh and repetitious forms of the same prayer book in different languages.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2034">Q: By claye kodesh" you mean the holy books?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2036">A: Holy books, the holy books.</sentence><sentence id="2037">But among that mass of 3 million fairly unimportant volumes, from his point of view, there were 1,300 priceless incunabula, manuscripts handwritten from early Middle Ages and Scholem worked for 90 days like a beaver, slept in that same <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, sorting out 3 million volumes and had these 1,300 precious, priceless, irreplaceable items set aside.</sentence><sentence id="2038">He packed them into five large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wooden packing crates</span>, each five feet by five feet, not impossible to handle, not gigantic, and labeled them.</sentence><sentence id="2039">And that's where the fear started.</sentence><sentence id="2040">Because a couple of days before his time ran out he came to me and he said what are we going to do.</sentence><sentence id="2041">I have applied for permission to take * "Claye Kodesh" are literally holy utensils.</sentence><sentence id="2042">1 these to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span>, the monuments and fine arts section of military government in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the American Army, monuments and fine arts section, has refused me permission.</sentence><sentence id="2043">They're the ones who allowed me to come and do the sorting.</sentence><sentence id="2044">They now refuse me permission to take these to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2045">And at first they wouldn't give me an explanation for that refusal, and then I finally pushed and I got it, and the explanation was that there is a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical seminary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I'm not sure of the name of it, I think it's the <span class="BUILDING">Theological Seminary</span> which says that there is no reason why all of these precious things should go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2046">All of them or some of them should be placed in our <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, the greatest <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the greatest Jewish population in the world.</sentence><sentence id="2047">This is a clear reflection of the absolutely indifferent or neutral, I don't want to say anti-Zionist position of the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2048">I don't even want to say the whole conservative movement in 1946.</sentence><sentence id="2049">And I state this publicly and it can be interpreted as a condemnation.</sentence><sentence id="2050">I'm not trying to condemn anybody, I'm trying to say that they had a letter from the chancellor saying, and that had to be I think at that time, Finkelstein, that the Army should not allow, they should not send all these documents to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2051">They had been collected from all the locations in Europe whose descendants are either dead or have migrated to the new

hold on it.</sentence><sentence id="2054">And he was distraught because his time was up, could not be renewed, and he didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="2055">Here he's got the stuff in five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">packing cases</span> and what does he do with it.</sentence><sentence id="2056">Again you have to make a decision at a certain moment in time and you make it, and I said Professor, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, relax, don't worry about it, I'll steal them, I'll get them out of the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and I'll get them to you, and don't ask me how because I don't know yet myself.</sentence><sentence id="2057">I was sorry that he had labeled them because what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time was a very active <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in pages of Beethoven and pages of Mozart, and one page was bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars.</sentence><sentence id="2058">Much later on when the story finally broke on the front page of the Stars and Stripes, and I can show you the issue which I have kept to this day, it listed the value of this treasure as $5 million.</sentence><sentence id="2059">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2060">What I did very simply was on New Years Eve when it everybody was off duty or drunk I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">JDC ambulance</span>, drove it to the <span class="DLF">back loading dock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2061">There was a Jewish captain in command of the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2396">Q: Let me touch on two issues we haven't touched on, on the European experience.</sentence><sentence id="2397">What was the attitude of the DP population toward the Germans, and what was it like for them to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2398">And let's start with that for a moment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2402">A: It's really a serious question and it's easily answered.</sentence><sentence id="2403">The DPs lived mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2404">There were no machine guns aimed at them and there were no guards at the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, but they were in an encircled area, they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2405">A few of them were out and were living freely in rented quarters among the German population, they were comfortable doing that, but 99 percent were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2406">They used to look through the <span class="DLF">wire</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they used to see Germans going on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, carrying little briefcases, going to work.</sentence><sentence id="2407">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was working and everybody was living a normal existence except they.</sentence><sentence id="2408">They hated the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2409">They resented them.</sentence><sentence id="2410">They didn't envy them.</sentence><sentence id="2411">They just would like to have torn every German apart if they could get their hands on them.</sentence><sentence id="2412">Now, they could because as I said they were not confined, they went out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> near which these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were located.</sentence><sentence id="2413">They bought goods in the <span class="BUILDING">German stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2414">They learned to speak German, many of them did.</sentence><sentence id="2415">But you could see the look in their eye and they hated every German.</sentence><sentence id="2416">Every once in a while some episode would flare up and you would see the expression of it in a physical form of rebellion.</sentence><sentence id="2417">And I'll just tell you one story which illustrates many many similar things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="2418">It was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2419"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where Hitler was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2420">In that very same <span class="BUILDING">German Army barracks</span> in which he was imprisoned in 1925, yes, "24,"25 when he wrote "Mein Kampf," are now living Jewish displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="2421">So you can imagine what an irony that was.</sentence><sentence id="2422">Okay, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsburg</span> one day a rumor spread through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that a Jewish child had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2423">Immediately a riot started through the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and a wave rushed out of <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and started to break <span class="DLF">store windows</span>, start <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on fire, over-turned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, attack and pummel any German passerby, quickly the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> turned into an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">armed camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2424">The purpose of the Army was to keep law and order.</sentence><sentence id="2425">Here it was breaking down between Jews and Germans, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2426">That's dynamite, that's incendiary.</sentence><sentence id="2427">So the Army pushed the Jews back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and 7 closed the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and padlocked them.</sentence><sentence id="2428">Okay, now you have U.S. troops ringed around and a couple of 50 caliber machine guns are brought and set up and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> is hovering delicately in the background but present, visibly present.</sentence><sentence id="2429">And so the Jews start yelling "Amerikanische SS, you American soldiers are acting like the SS.</sentence><sentence id="2430">Amerikanische Nazis."</sentence><sentence id="2431">Well, now the lieutenant in charge of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> says whoa, whoa, we're not Nazis and we're not here to hurt you, but you can't come and tear and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and the dialogue goes and the Jews boom!,</sentence><sentence id="2432">burst out of the padlocked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> once more and break the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2433">Then the scuffle starts between American troops and Jewish DPs and Germans ringing around looking at it with great pleasure, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<span class="BUILDING">church</span> will do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2562">We tried and we asked him if he would write a pastoral letter which should be read in every <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and this would kind of put a blanket on the -- he wouldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="2563">So our fourth visit we went to Mr. Berman, and Yacob Berman says if the Jews are guilty of having brought Communism here to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it's the best thing that we could ever do for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I will take whatever consequences.</sentence><sentence id="2564">And furthermore, if the consequences are that a few Jews get killed, well a few Jews get killed.</sentence><sentence id="2565">It's just a few more.</sentence><sentence id="2566">We are fighting for a whole new world.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And he was a Communist idealogue and he believed it and he preached it.</sentence><sentence id="2568">And we're fighting for a whole new world means for everybody and for a larger number of Jews, and even if there were a few casualties there always are in war.</sentence><sentence id="2569">And the last point I want to make with you gentlemen is that they should remain here.</sentence><sentence id="2570">If you came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the American commander to find out if the Jews here are going to flee, if | have anything to do I will see to it that they will leave this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> nakt und barfuss, they will go out naked and barefoot because they shouldn't go out.</sentence><sentence id="2571">Well, you know, this was zero for four.</sentence><sentence id="2572">We had seen four people, the Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal, and then the Communist leader, and you get no sympathy from any of them.</sentence><sentence id="2573">But then when we started to go around and we began to talk to the Haganah guys who were working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and we began to talk to ordinary Jews whom we were recommended to, we got the picture that they're packing and leaving.</sentence><sentence id="2574">And we returned and we wrote the report to McNarney that he could expect, that the military command in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could expect over the period of the next year to a year and a half approximately 150,000 people to come flooding in from the east to the west.</sentence><sentence id="2575">And the Army had better gear up for it and prepare it, and the Army would have a political decision to make, not a military one as to whether the <span class="DLF">borders</span> should be closed or opened.</sentence><sentence id="2576">And if you want to close the <span class="DLF">borders</span> and you want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in then you're going to have to do it by armed force or setting up <span class="DLF">barriers</span> and <span class="DLF">blockades</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2577">McNarney looked at that and he said well, whoa, this is way over my head.</sentence><sentence id="2578">Bernstein, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> please and talk to the President.</sentence><sentence id="2579">A decision about whether the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is open or closed to 150,000 refugees is not for me to make.</sentence><sentence id="2580">So Phil did, he flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and talked to Truman.</sentence><sentence id="2581">It took about 15 minutes.</sentence><sentence id="2582">He got an immediate green light, and he came back.</sentence><sentence id="2583">Okay, McNarney has got a green light from the President, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> are open.</sentence><sentence id="2584">So Lippman is on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovak border</span> and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> are all manned with our people and that is what raised the ultimate total to 250,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="2585">It's just as simple as that.</sentence><sentence id="2586">That was the final result of the Kielce Pogrom.</sentence><sentence id="2587">Those 42 victims triggered off a major demographic shift.</sentence><sentence id="2588">And the accumulation of that many people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself had the political influence plus the episode of the Exodus to produce that vote in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> in November of "47.</sentence><sentence id="2589">By November of "47 everything is falling into place.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2654">A: I don't remember the latter date where I was.</sentence><sentence id="2655">I was probably -- no, I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> in "47.</sentence><sentence id="2656">Of course, I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2657">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> November 29th "47.</sentence><sentence id="2658">May 15th "48 I was shuttling between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span>, <span class="REGION">Delaware</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2659"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span>, <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> had to do with DuPont.</sentence><sentence id="2660"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had to do with the <span class="BUILDING">Haganah headquarters</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which was in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, 14th East 60th Street.</sentence><sentence id="2661">Next <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Copacabana nightclub</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2662">The director of the Haganah in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was Mr. Teddy Kollek, now the Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, a world famous figure.</sentence><sentence id="2663">So Teddy had ordered me when I returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, he reminded me that I was still in the Haganah and never mind I was running around making speeches for the UJA, that's kid stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2664">As far as the Haganah is concerned it's real stuff, and he wanted me to, contrary to the embargo laws of the United States Government, to buy, pack, ship out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> all the dynamite, brick production, of DuPont.</sentence><sentence id="2665">A brick is a brick, the size of a brick, the size and shape of a brick, but this brick is a piece of dynamite.</sentence><sentence id="2666">Now you take three of them, stack them up one on top of each other, and take three more, one on top of each other, and wire the six of them together and attach the wire, whatever length you want, to a detonator and you blow up that package, we called it a satchel charge because you took the six bricks, put them inside of a knapsack, you know, a canvas GI knapsack, it looked like a little satchel, it should have been called a knapsack charge more accurately, and it will blow a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in a <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> or it will blow a <span class="DLF">hole</span> through an <span class="DLF">iron gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2667">And that was the main artillery that the Israel Armed Forces had.</sentence><sentence id="2668">It didn't have any big artillery, it didn't have mortars, Howitzers.</sentence><sentence id="2669">So I was buying the dynamite, shipping it to myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span>, trans- shipping it down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tampico</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span>, buying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span>, getting the stuff on board in cardboard cartons that said "Del Monte peaches, fruit salad, pineapples."</sentence><sentence id="2670">We stole the cartons from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Del Monte</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2671">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were manifested to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span>, but when they went out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tampico</span> they didn't turn and go through the <span class="DLF">canal</span> to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span>, they went to the <span class="REGION">Mid East</span>, in the other direction.</sentence><sentence id="2672">So that's where I was all through "48. "</sentence><sentence id="2673">48 was a hell of a year with me and the FBI.</sentence><sentence id="2674">But everything came out okay.</sentence><sentence id="2675">No charges, no nothing, and a happy ending to the story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2698">Q: Herb, is there anything we haven't touched?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2700">A: No, Michael.</sentence><sentence id="2701">No, I think we've covered the main things.</sentence><sentence id="2702">But the summary of the whole business is that you had a population that had the patience and the stamina to overcome all of the evil and the agony they had been through, all the losses they had suffered, and who had the hope and the faith in something they believed in that represented their future.</sentence><sentence id="2703">So the patience and the stamina, the faith and hope characterized that DP population.</sentence><sentence id="2704">With all the hatred boiling in them, with all of the stuff that many of them have never gotten out of their systems for their whole lives, that's one element.</sentence><sentence id="2705">Then you've got the other supporting elements.</sentence><sentence id="2706">You've got the group, you've got the United States Army, benevolent, friendly, cooperative.</sentence><sentence id="2707">I can't compliment them enough.</sentence><sentence id="2708">Number 1 two, you've got the group of American Jewish organizations that came in with dough and support.</sentence><sentence id="2709">Number three, you've got the Israelis, the Palestinian personalities beginning with Ben Gurion himself and the whole mechanism of the Haganah and their support that they provided.</sentence><sentence id="2710">And then lastly you have won over world public opinion so that you get that great ringing majority vote of two when the resolution was finally passed in November of "47.</sentence><sentence id="2711">It won by two.</sentence><sentence id="2712">The two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span>, great big Democratic powers that pushed the ball over the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2713">But that was the combination.</sentence><sentence id="2714">Now, we've talked about the DPs themselves and we've talked about the Army and we've talked about the JDC and the great organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2715">We've talked about the Haganah and the Israelis.</sentence><sentence id="2716">The world conscieuce, feeble as it was, did its trick and the State was created.</sentence><sentence id="2717">And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and where I am now and what did it all mean, I really believe the following statement, and it may sound strange to you, those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948 when the State was established, those three years I think are the single group of any three years in the entire history of the Jewish people, and I mean every single thing I can think of that we've been through since Abraham, I don't think there is another period of three years which has ever been so determinative.</sentence><sentence id="2718">Because we came out of the death into the life and those are the two extremes, death and life.</sentence><sentence id="2719">There aren't any others.</sentence><sentence id="2720">There is nothing similar.</sentence><sentence id="2721">Persecution and inquisition of this one or that one, or running from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, running from another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, that's all blips on the screen.</sentence><sentence id="2722">But this is the definitive thing.</sentence><sentence id="2723">We could have passed off the stage of history.</sentence><sentence id="2724">There's no doubt in my mind about it.</sentence><sentence id="2725">One third of the people dead in Europe, one third of the people paralyzed and ineffective in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> during the crucial years, almost another third of the people lost behind the Iron Curtain, you couldn't get to them, they couldn't be useful or helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2726">The Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably.</sentence><sentence id="2727">And out of that three short years later you find you're back into vibrancy and action and you're winning a war.</sentence><sentence id="2728">That's a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="2729">I don't know any other miracle, and I'm even talking about the crossing of the Red Sea, and I'm talking about anything else you want to mention, I don't know of anything else that's comparable to it.</sentence><sentence id="2730">So if I had the zekhut, the merit, to live through those three years, work my way through those three years, add something, well then it was a life worth living.</sentence><sentence id="2731">And that's how I sum it up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
