<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: I think it might have been 350.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="562">All over <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">About the same as we had before, but of course not with that circulation.</sentence><sentence id="564">It's just natural.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: And they were distributed what, individually, you would pass them out to people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Yes, for instance, when you had copied, let's say 50, you had other coming, fetching them, and of course we also used schoolchildren to distribute them.</sentence><sentence id="572">Could be old people, young people and schoolchildren, girls and boys.</sentence><sentence id="573">They were spread.</sentence><sentence id="574">But when they were grown up, they were taken and of course when you had 20 people [indecipherable] you, it was seen by some traitors, some informers, they would inform on you.</sentence><sentence id="575">They had put up the same as they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576">Security police and informers.</sentence><sentence id="577">You know, in any <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> you would have one to two percent which are traitors to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="578">And now they found them, and they were taken -- they had the -- they were about 4,000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="579">In -- over the two, three years, we had 4,000 informers.</sentence><sentence id="580">And when they saw man with the paper, they informed it to the Gestapo, and that man was tortured.</sentence><sentence id="581">And of course, he had been to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> getting it, and that was -- of course he -- you cannot stand the torture, it's impossible with the torture.</sentence><sentence id="582">They came to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> with Middle Age torture.</sentence><sentence id="583">Middle Age torture, which I had read about, it i -- was history, and now they came into open with the Norwegian -- with the security police and they -- then they also organized, or reorganized Norwegian police.</sentence><sentence id="584">So they had about, I should say, 20 percent of them got taken into a new state,</sentence><sentence id="586">4 it was federal police, state police, and they were just teached -- taught by the Gestapo, so they were as good as any German Gestapo, any German security officer.</sentence><sentence id="587">So it was a very -- if you were in that, call it that trade, newspaper distribution, you would have a good chance to be arrested, tortured and killed.</sentence><sentence id="588">Was a very great risk.</sentence><sentence id="589">We all -- they all knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="610">Q: But it was e-equally as risky to take the newspaper and be seen with it, as it was to deliver it, I gather?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="612">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="613">Then they would arrest you, they would torture you and say where did you get it from?</sentence><sentence id="614">Where -- where did you get it from?</sentence><sentence id="615">And, of course, they couldn't stand it, and they -- then they were arrested, others were arrested.</sentence><sentence id="616">But it all the time they kept -- kept on, it was more and more newspapers, secret newspapers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="622">Q: Did you write some of the stuff that went into the newspapers, or did you distribute them, what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: No, we -- I tried a little to begin with, because I started with this in 1940, we already -- we had the newspaper that started already autumn -- fall, "40, and the -- well, I think it fall -- deg41, it was really started, on the -- the very good newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="625">So -- but it was written by our best brains, very good articles, and today you can read them in our <span class="BUILDING">resistance museum</span>, they're all there, you can read them, and very interesting to read now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="628">Q: So how long did you work with the clandestine newspap -- were you also, by the way, working at this -- as an assistant accountant still?</sentence><sentence id="629">Did you go back?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="632">A: Oh yes, I tried, but I hadn't had time for this, because now I was a resistant worker on full time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="634">Q: Full time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: So then I started to make different aliases because after one year, the Gestapo heard about Hans Jacobsen, he was one of the -- what the hell this is -- one of the leaders.</sentence><sentence id="641">And then the -- a man was tortured, and he said that well, he knew Hans Jacobsen, that was his address, and then of course then the Germans went out and they couldn't find any Hans Jacobsen at all, he had no telephone, he had no address, he had just nothing.</sentence><sentence id="642">So they -- I was there, and then --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="643">Q: Was that your alias at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="650">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="652">A: But then when that was known by the Germans, I changed into another name.</sentence><sentence id="653">And I really started to fake this myself.</sentence><sentence id="654">I learned it, and I think I -- I used -- when I had the false papers I had no -- I had made [indecipherable] myself.</sentence><sentence id="655">So I believed them, I knew they were correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Was this easy for you to do?</sentence><sentence id="661">To fake yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="664">A: Well, no, it wasn't easy to start with, but for instance, will you -- you will see in one of my passports, one of the worst Gestapos we have ever had was a fellow called Martinsen, he was the head of the Norwegian part of Gestapo, and I today -- even today I can write his signature, because I had the signa -- his signature on one of my passports, and I think I today could write K.A. Martinsen, pol -- chief of police, secret police in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">So i -- i -- that was -- I hadn't had it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so I had to start from the ke -- beginning, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="669">Q: Tell me something, did you go -- during this period, the beginning period a-as you started in the resistance in -- did you go back to your family and talk to your parents and tell them what you were doing, so the -- that they --</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="3401">They would have no -- no food, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3402">It would be terrible.</sentence><sentence id="3403">It would ruin the whole situation here.</sentence><sentence id="3404">And then the Nazi government, Norwegian, they had to give in, because the Germans would be furious if their laborers, all those, didn't get any food at all, it will stop all

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3441">Q: And then once they agreed, you gave back the cards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3443">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3444">Of course, this was done by another group, but I worked closely with them.</sentence><sentence id="3445">I didn't do that part of it, but my part was to get hold of the cards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3449">Q: But that giving back process could also be dangerous because they could then catch the group</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3450">A: Oh yes, that -- you are quite right, but the way we did it, well we just gave them first 20,000 cards and then they -- we said, you can pick them up outside the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, for instance.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3451">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3453">A: And then part of it we put in small parcels, and on top of them we wrote, dangerous explosives.</sentence><sentence id="3454">And it was put round in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and it was a hell of a trouble for the police, the Nazi police, and they didn't dare to touch them.</sentence><sentence id="3455">So they sent for a company <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, an -- German specialists to -- on the -- to take over, and then they opened it very carefully, and it was ration -- ration cards.</sentence><sentence id="3456">So we had a little fun also.</sentence><sentence id="3457">But of course we were -- man -- many people into this, and -- but it was all coordinated very well from the top.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3463">Q: Now, ins -- in August of 1944, there was a bombing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korzewall</span>, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> parts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3465">A: Yes, that was an important <span class="NPIP">place</span>, it was very hard to find because the German camouflaged it with a very big [indecipherable] very big, you know, the biggest in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3466">And half of it was put into stock of all kinds of spec-special re-repair parts for -- for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter planes</span>, Messerschmitt.</sentence><sentence id="3467">And they had also a-about -- about 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fuselage</span> that was there, to put -- put up to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> later on, and we got to know it, and it was very hard to know where it was and what they did, but we had to get intelligence, and one of my friends, he got to know all of it.</sentence><sentence id="3468">So then we went in there, and the part -- the <span class="REGION">Norwegian part</span> was no guarded, strangely enough.</sentence><sentence id="3469">Was one guard, which I by</sentence><sentence id="3471">3 the way took -- had -- took hold of when we came there in the night and pacified him.</sentence><sentence id="3472">And then we went in there and then went into the German part in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, through three <span class="DLF">fences</span>, and put down about 300 pounds of dynamite.</sentence><sentence id="3473">We blew up the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3474">And I think it wasn't very nice for them to use their spare parts in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3475">And the same had to be done with ball bearing.</sentence><sentence id="3476">Ball bearing was terribly important for any <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3477">And Swedish -- <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> had the best ball bearings in the world, you know, they had also a small place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span>, which was also blown up.</sentence><sentence id="3478">Another thing what -- how -- how would we know what to -- what take, of course, when we talk about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3479"><span class="COUNTRY">Submarines</span> use batteries.</sentence><sentence id="3480"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Submarines batteries</span>, that means sulfur, the acid.</sentence><sentence id="3481">And we had two of them in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, so the way we could hit the submarine weapon to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> was to ruin these two <span class="BUILDING">acid factories</span>, and they were stopped.</sentence><sentence id="3482">So they couldn't produce any more, they were ruined for the rest of the war, and then it was not -- very few batteries coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> to -- norw -- to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>, because at the <span class="DLF">coastline</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, during the war you could hide every nation's fleet, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> and everything, in Norwegian fjords.</sentence><sentence id="3483">You could have the whole -- the world could be placed into Norwegian fjords.</sentence><sentence id="3484">And they did, of course, all those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>, they disappeared in <span class="REGION">Norwegian fjords</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3485">So they were -- it was very important to hit them in a way of taking away sulfur, as in for batteries.</sentence><sentence id="3486">Then you had to have experts to help you [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="3487">But when we talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haugland</span>, he was also wireless operator on the heavy water operation, and on my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3488">And so he had a [indecipherable] experience.</sentence><sentence id="3489">Two s-s-small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- two small town boys were also there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
