the Holocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it's a fact.</sentence><sentence id="466">I mean, the Germans had her take -- they had picked her up several times and let her go.</sentence><sentence id="467">But there was a--a record that she had been caught at -- as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="468">There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had managed to -- she -- she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="469">As a matter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn't know it, but they were of a communist girl.</sentence><sentence id="470">And guess what?</sentence><sentence id="471">The Germans had her on the list of -- of people that they -- they had to -- so she came -- she was taken to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>, she was taken to the Gestapo head.</sentence><sentence id="472">And she walks into her <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> -- into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, and she sees a picture behind his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> of Bialystok.</sentence><sentence id="473">So he -- she didn't let him say hello, it's just -- she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have this picture of Bialystok?</sentence><sentence id="474">So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I was Interview with Samuel Marein-Efron 8 May 8, 2013 the head of the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>.</sentence><sentence id="475">So how -- how were you related to Bialystok?She says, well, I-- I belong to the German population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, which -- which were <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owners, and my father was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owner.</sentence><sentence id="476">And this is how I know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> very well.</sentence><sentence id="477">My -- my -- my parents were still there for a while, I don't know where they are now, because the general -- Generalgouvernement is not very informative as to where people are.</sentence><sentence id="478">So, you know, he made -- she made a friendship, and when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever -- God knows [indecipherable] was sent.</sentence><sentence id="479">She managed to walk out four hours later.</sentence><sentence id="480">And she managed also to -- this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura of credibility.</sentence><sentence id="481">In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a communist?</sentence><sentence id="482">She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma -- person, you -- you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself.</sentence><sentence id="483">But this is something which is -- which is gone past.</sentence><sentence id="484">So she managed to -- to survive this way, on this set of papers, for close to three -- three -- well, more than that, she -- she -- she crossed the -- the -- she's crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> from -- from the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span>, from the other <span class="NPIP">half</span>, the night of Christmas of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="485">They figured that, and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a Christmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to cross into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">Into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help her, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August, September of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="487">She -- she had joined also, the Slovakian underground.</sentence><sentence id="488">There was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August -- July or August of 1944, which was the reason that the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="489">They felt that the Slovakians couldn't handle this, so they came in, and they cleaned out the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to their liking.</sentence><sentence id="490">My cousin, curiously enough, could have survived, but again, she -- principle was -- used to get her, and this time it got her, too.</sentence><sentence id="491">Was basically she -- she -- she tells that she was picked up by the Germans, taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>, and sat down with a group of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="492">And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you doing sitting there?</sentence><sentence id="493">You're not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="494">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="495">So she got up and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and she describes it as having had a terrible night.</sentence><sentence id="496">I mean, considering that the rest of the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="497">So she basically walked in the next morning, into <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> and said, you know, you're looking for Jews, I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="498">The man was floored.</sentence><sentence id="499">He never in his wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="500">She was about as far physically from being a Jew as -- as -- as you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="501">Of course, didn't -- this didn't help her.</sentence><sentence id="502">But she helped other people.</sentence><sentence id="503">She took Mr. Mousekopf's(ph) wife and daughter.</sentence><sentence id="504">She -- she -- she was able to -- she went to <span

she told the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> that she was a surgeon, she was a --a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="507">So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for -- for the inmates, but for actually the general population outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="508">So she was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.9981804" long="16.277669">Gross-Rosen</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">And she said that she needed
