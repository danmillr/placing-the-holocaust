<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well uh, there are there are pictures that remain with you like uh you see in flashbacks in movies sometimes and uh for me it's in real life several uh pictures that are alive to this day, and that would be like the first telephone uh that was installed in just before the war broke out and the reason that I would remember it is that uh I would watch people walking to uh talking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and uh that uh was such a wonder to me that uh I couldn't explain it and it's remained with me to this day.</sentence><sentence id="32">People walking up to this certain <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and talking to the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">But uh the next uh flashback would uh be uh when the war broke out and I was four years old, in 1939 the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> coming over our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and uh flying low and uh dropping their bombs and everybody running to shelter and uh screaming and just not running fast enough or uh one obstructing to wait for the other.</sentence><sentence id="34">The panic that uh ensued.</sentence><sentence id="35">And so on and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Uh, from the life in uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I have only uh few uh memories.</sentence><sentence id="64">But uh I remember that uh my mother had been uh kept at the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> for a while and when she came back emaciated and so this picture that comes back to me.</sentence><sentence id="65">Of course I later learned the reason that uh she had been uh kept at the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> was that uh my father had uh uh a lot of uh being that he was wealthy and uh had connections with the leading uh members of the community, so even after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized, he was able to uh obtain through uh uh payment a document from the uh uh mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolen</span> and the uh German commissar, the German uh governor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a special document for uh as a merchant and uh supplier of uh the uh uh shoes to the German army and whatever, so he he obtained uh a passport uh so to speak, a uh it was which a document with which he was able to travel and uh the idea was that uh after uh the war broke out and the, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided to the German Russian sphere of influence, uh his uh he owned two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were confiscated so uh we couldn't get no means of escape but uh he was still dreaming of the, to get us uh out somehow uh with money that he still had and influence.</sentence><sentence id="66">So it was the travel document uh they plotted a scheme uh that we would uh hire a uh a horse uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawn- carriage</span> and that was to take us to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where the Russians were.</sentence><sentence id="67">Of course uh when we reached the uh <span class="DLF">bridge</span> uh of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, the uh German soldiers were there and uh two uh German soldiers on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> uh would confront us with the carbines on the backs and shout uh, "Alle Juden [zuruck (ph)], which reverberates to this day.</sentence><sentence id="68">And uh screaming and the uh weeping by the women and children and nothing helped.</sentence><sentence id="69">We were uh driven back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">Uh eventually we were taken, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated and we were taken to uh a uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolanow</span>; and uh there we stayed from 1942 "til 1943.But even there, my father had not given up; and uh he had uh uh bribed uh some people that had influence, the uh head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> to uh close an eye to the fact that we uh we would run away.</sentence><sentence id="71">They would smuggle out at a certain time at the night.</sentence><sentence id="72">And uh it was before uh in December, just before Christmas time that uh we were uh driven on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleigh</span> to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to uh uh to be hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>, except that uh the farmer who was hiding us, he had uh visitors and uh these visitors had heard one of the uh children was coughing or what, so that uh the farmer became afraid uh he would be betrayed, uh that he is hiding Jews, and we have to be smuggled back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from which we had escaped.</sentence><sentence id="73">That was in 1942, the last chance that uh we uh we had still to uh to be free, after which uh on the raid that uh the</sentence><sentence id="75">Germans uh sent the SS to uh pick up uh old people and uh children, where my youngest sister was four.</sentence><sentence id="76">She was taken on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> - all the uh screaming and all the yelling - it didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="77">And uh whether they gassed those people or shot them we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="78">It was the last time we saw her.</sentence><sentence id="79">We stayed uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volanof</span> until 1943 and were taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in uh called uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and uh there we stayed until 1944.</sentence><sentence id="80">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: What did you do in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="103">You told me you were a messenger.</sentence><sentence id="104">What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: Uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, I uh I was not uh with the uh work squads that were uh going out, uh outside the camp working in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> uh whether it was munitions or whatever for the uh Germans.</sentence><sentence id="109">So I uh I cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">police barracks</span> the uh and I served as a messenger boy which proved to be of uh crucial importance when uh the uh when uh uh making these selections to again uh to pick out uh those unable to work whether it was children or elderly or or those that uh became ill and so on.</sentence><sentence id="110">Uh I was considered uh important or productive and left alone so uh that when we arrived in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I was listed as fourteen years of age and uh apparently that helped me again uh be considered productive and not taken straight to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Can you describe your arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Uh up to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and the uh first subsequent uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> we still managed to be living as a uh unit, as a family unit uh even though my younger sister at that point was taken away.</sentence><sentence id="117">Uh we were still uh with the uh parents as a family.</sentence><sentence id="118">Before being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> though, uh they uh loaded the uh men in separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons on the</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the women on separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and uh when the decision was to be made how to divide the children uh I was placed with uh my mother.</sentence><sentence id="119">They decided, between my parents they decided that I should go with my mother and let my father take only my older brother with him in order to uh have a better chance of escaping from the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh when uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slows down or comes to a stop.</sentence><sentence id="120">They were hoping to be able to uh run away and uh he felt that I was too weak and too young to uh to join him.</sentence><sentence id="121">And that proved to be uh a blessing that uh I went with the uh women's uh into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> because uh the first selection that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh in the men's uh camp, they rounded up uh all the youngsters and uh my brother included and uh again he was uh at the time uh about fourteen, maybe going on fifteen whereas I I was only nine.</sentence><sentence id="122">They took him with the other uh children to the uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">And that being on a uh special day, uh the Jewish New Year, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, which was uh Mengele's uh way of uh uh making a point of uh making selections on uh on uh Jewish events, Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="124">And uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh when we had arrived uh was the height of the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and uh they didn't put us straight into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> because they couldn't handle that many arrivals in a given day, so that we went two weeks uh without a uh number.</sentence><sentence id="125">Eventually they did take us in and uh we became uh the slaves of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, those that could still uh be useful to work.</sentence><sentence id="126">And uh the daily routine was uh for the adults uh working uh in the nearby <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and uh I was uh a messenger and so on. (</sentence><sentence id="127">Pause) What uh got me to uh be able to survive the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a uh incident uh where a kapo had seen me with uh my uh mother and my sister at one time and</sentence><sentence id="129">uh she took a great uh liking to me or pity on me, and she would uh call me to her uh <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> from time to time to feed me.</sentence><sentence id="130">There was one incident in which uh II thought I would never forgive myself.</sentence><sentence id="131">When I returned to the uh to my <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with my mother and that day not having been fed by the uh kapo I was asking for my uh portion of food which was two slices of bread uh for supper and uh having no breakfast to look forward to and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I was uh hungry not having eaten and uh to discover that my uh mother uh didn't expect that and shared the uh meal with my sister who told me that she gave it to my uh sister.</sentence><sentence id="133">And I carried on at the time, as hungry as I was and made my mother feel guilty and my sister feel guilty which uh I was ashamed of later on for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="134">And uh the thing was that uh as young as I was uh the drive to uh survive was so strong that uh you had to learn fast and uh whether from the kapo or uh by other means - I don't remember - I had somehow managed to get uh ahold of cigarettes and uh when we were separated from uh my mother and from my sister, uh I was able to smuggle to them through a uh cousin of mine cigarettes that they should be able, in order for them to exchange for uh for food.</sentence><sentence id="135">And uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself an incident that uh only many years later I could comprehend what was happening to me when uh the same uh kapo had uh brought one day to uh her <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and uh during the daytime when everybody was out to work she had uh commandeered a uh a young attractive woman to wash me up and uh talking nicely to me that it's important to be clean and uh that girl carefully washed me and fondled me and then uh that kapo took me uh on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and uh tried to arouse me and uh as a nine year old boy uh lying beside her, on top of her and in any kind of <span class="NPIP">position</span>, whatever she tried uh must have have been futile, futile but uh that was the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for this poor woman. (</sentence><sentence id="136">Pause) They were a degra...degradation that uh they put people to uh to the point that uh living was not worth living. (</sentence><sentence id="137">Pause) And then uh remembering uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, being liberated when the Germans retreated ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Can you tell me, tell me first about the food.</sentence><sentence id="163">You told me about the woman kapo and her salami.</sentence><sentence id="164">Tell me a little more about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">It's OK.</sentence><sentence id="166">It's OK. (</sentence><sentence id="167">Pause) Tell me as much about her as you can. (</sentence><sentence id="168">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="177">Uh uh one of the things that uh uh I had constantly uh in my mind was uh the vision the kapo having a uh round uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> uh sort of like this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">side table</span> but taller and a uh shelf on the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="178">It was covered with a uh uh some kind of table cloth but on the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> being a piece of salami and bread at your disposal.</sentence><sentence id="179">And the idea that you would, you can uh eat your uh your meal and uh have some left over, have uh extra food for later.</sentence><sentence id="180">It was uh the dream, a dream that uh was to be with me for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="181">Uh when we were liberated and uh we were being fed uh by the, at the time we were being cared for by the <span class="BUILDING">UNRA</span> which was uh the uh relief organization, a Jewish relief organization active all over Europe taking care of the refugees and survivors.</sentence><sentence id="182">Uh when we were uh being uh served meals it was not uh a sit-down meal but you had to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and uh your plate was being filled with the uh different foods and to this day I can remember that asking for uh when they filled my plate for an extra spoon, extra spoon even though uh one would, should have uh known uh after the first or second time around that uh there's no need to fill up the plate that much more than you can eat because uh some of it won't stay on the plate and you wouldn't be</sentence><sentence id="184">able to finish the meal or uh it took a long time to adjust and.</sentence><sentence id="185">to know that uh you uh you take what you feel you won't uh you'll eat and if you're not uh satisfied, that you can go back and get a second portion - took weeks before the mind (pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Take a minute and if you can go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one more time.</sentence><sentence id="199">You told me about an incident with the kapo and a toy.</sentence><sentence id="200">Can you tell us about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Yeah. (</sentence><sentence id="205">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Take your time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: (Pause - drinking water) Uh, at one point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh that after I had met this kapo and uh as I mentioned uh if not for the food and occasionally a piece of clothing - she had a uh coat commandeered for me uh because uh when people arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they were uh, their clothes with the outer belongings they may have still had with them, was taken away and uh we were given that uh pajama type uh prisoner's garb uh striped prisoner's garb.</sentence><sentence id="211">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="212">She somehow managed to get me a coat one time.</sentence><sentence id="213">Shoes and another time uh wanted to give me a toy that I refused and uh I pointed out to her that uh my brother was taken to the uh to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and uh this particular story I didn't uh, I cannot say that I recollect having that conversation and but uh she told it to my mother, that I refused the toy and my mother had talked to me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Why did you refuse the toy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: I refused the toy uh pointing to the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and telling her that uh how can I play when uh my brother was taken to the uh <span class="DLF">chimney</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">We could see from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that uh tall <span class="DLF">chimney</span>, the flame uh going up day and night, smoking.</sentence><sentence id="222">And uh the picture of a selection.</sentence><sentence id="223">Having gone through that uh once in your lifetime and you will never forget it.</sentence><sentence id="224">Uh the uh infamous uh Dr. Mengele, he would stand at the head of the uh column of the procession of uh naked people and uh some way before reaching, uh coming up in front of Mengele, we saw that uh there's left and there's right and uh what he was doing is he would uh people would march up in front of him and uh he would look at them and whether they are still able bodied or not, able to contribute uh toward the work, to the labor in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">So uh when my turn came, and somebody was whispering to me uh to the right, and somehow I uh managed to stay in that right <span class="DLF">lane</span> without being uh motioned back to the left <span class="DLF">lane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">That's what uh made the difference of life and death.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Can you recall children?</sentence><sentence id="235">Did you see other children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Uh at some point uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself 1 was separated uh from my uh sister and from my mother and put in a uh children's uh block.</sentence><sentence id="239">In that <span class="DLF">children's block</span> there were not only Jewish children uh but also uh uh Polish and from uh Russian uh war uh prisoners of war, some of them uh even younger than me.</sentence><sentence id="240">Some of them uh uh that uh were still uh babies (pause).</sentence><sentence id="241">When uh the Germans retreated and uh they took uh all the inmates on the forced</sentence><sentence id="243">march, they left uh the uh sick children and those that were uh unable to walk... They have been children under the age of six.</sentence><sentence id="244">Well, I hide among these and other kids; we managed to stay behind until the Russians arrived, and we were liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Because those that were taken on the forced march and those that were unable to uh keep up, they were simply shot uh on the uh on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">After we were liberated and uh as I mentioned before I had uh run away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when the uh first Russian soldiers arrived and they had nothing on them but uh they were asking us for cigarettes or asking from us where's the uh supplies, and uh we had managed to find some sugar uh that was not burned and we showed them where the uh there was, where the sugar was.</sentence><sentence id="247">We took out with us uh a few sacks or whatever to uh and ran away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, myself and two other boys of whom I never heard again.</sentence><sentence id="248">These two boys uh may have uh ended up being uh raised by uh some childless family like uh I was supposed to.</sentence><sentence id="249">And as the uh the experiment by that couple didn't succeed . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
