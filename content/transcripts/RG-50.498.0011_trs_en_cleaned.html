<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: | think he believed that when 2 people meet there is a 2 way influence, | don't think one influences the other, it works both ways.</sentence><sentence id="9">That is why | askthe question but | don't know my answer.</sentence><sentence id="10">When you started to work on your Kiesinger case were you in the <span class="BUILDING">Youth German Office</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: Yes, | learned in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that the <span class="BUILDING">German Youth Office</span> opened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> | sent my cv and | was taken as a secretary, nothing else, so | belonged to the founding members of this French German Youth Office, my work was not such an interesting one, my day as a German what was of interest to me was to work in an <span class="BUILDING">Institution</span> where there was Youth of both <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, to learn and at this time in 1966 when Kiesinger was elected.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="15">Q Would you be so kind to trll us the story of the Kiesinger case.</sentence><sentence id="16">How did it start from your point of view, how it developed and of course the story of your involvement.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: When | saw in the newspapers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that the new Chancellor was a member of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="18">the Nazi Party and adjoined to the Hitler propaganda for <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span> , Serge said to me Beata there are some moments you can do something and he wrote for me a "tribune" in French and | brought these free tribunes to a French newspaper at this yime called Combat, it was a left newspaper, and so | was embarrassing to the Chief that | was a German who took the opportunity to let us know in a French newspaper that there was somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who could not allow this man to represent the German news and will be the representative for the German government, so they published 3 tribunes and stated the German news can recognize a man, Willie Brandt, who was a freedom fighter but never a man like Kiesinger who is a danger to democracy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in one of the articles | said | was fired from my German-French news office as | had signed with my name not as belonging to the German-French news office,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="19">There was no reason for them to fire me, besides that they were against what | said and | was fired from one day to the other, this was finally the moment for me to decide if we are going ahead.</sentence><sentence id="20">The letter we received said if you take back what you said in the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="21">article you can continue to work in our <span class="BUILDING">Institution</span>, and we said NO.</sentence><sentence id="22">Then Serge remembered when his Father was deported he had a friend who came back who told my Mother-in-law when the Kapo was beating him my Father-in-law defended him and he was sent to the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> in retaliation and we said if my Father-in-law could in a situation where he was in danger of death resist to the Germans in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Democratic Partyextermination camp</span>, how can we not resist and continue our campaign against Kiesinger, and so this was our decision, my husband was working at this time having a salary, | was fired and he helped me not only with advises but also with money and we started a campaign.</sentence><sentence id="23">| went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to see members of the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> and Journalists, students, in order to say you know the situation where you have to protest, it is the first time after the war that the German Government is ruled by a Nazi and there is not a lot of involvement, Answers stated that he had been elected democratically and let's go.</sentence><sentence id="24">This was finally the decision that Serge and myself reached, so in order to say we can not do anything legally thn we have to change and discuss what to do.</sentence><sentence id="25">First interruptions in the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> when Kiesinger spoke, and | was arrested and there were news in the newspapers and they had to tell why | was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="26">The second attack was when we learned that there was going to be a Congress of the Christian Democratic Party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, very controversial because the students had protested stating that this Party will never have a meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">Will not take place At this time another lie, big demonstrations took place about that this Congress will not take place, so we decided something can be done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> at the International Congress of the Party; so | left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> without preparation besides having a photograph of somebody who promised to pick me and take me to the <span class="BUILDING">Congress Hall</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="28">So | arrived, not knowing what to do as we had forwarded all the documents against Kiesinger and distributed all over, so | was known as the woman attacking Kiesinger for being the German Chancellor and that is all, you learn in experimenting and it took about 4-5 days, so | had to go to Press meetings, to Conference Public meetings; | was unable to approach Kiesinger close enough to slap him, the action we had we had prepared to place the young generation against the older generation and slap somebody is not so easy, | did not want to do it in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel hall</span> where you only face each other; we had to have the support of the public and the media and so the last day of the Congress, at closing and when Kiesinger had to deliver his last speech | had the chance with the card of a journalist to enter the <span class="INT_SPACE">Hall</span> and to be in a situation across the <span class="INT_SPACE">Hall</span> finding myself behind him and so when all these possibilities are given | took my courage and yelled " Nazi go out" and slap him, he turn back to me and it was dangerous for me because in the first raw he had his bodyguards, but with him standing behind me they could not shoot, he had no idea of what happened to him, who | was because as | said it was not the first time that | brought his Nazi past, | was arrested , then there was a discussion: " let her go because | was sexually not satisfied", a crazy woman, but it could not take because | was known with all my documents ,so he was obliged to suit me and | was put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, condemned the same day to 1 year in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> without suspension, and as | said before, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> the City ruled by the Allies, | was a French Citizen, |</sentence></p><p><sentence id="29">am German and French, and if arrested | could claim my French Citizenship and ask to see the French Commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to be transferred in front of a <span class="BUILDING">French Court</span> and this was the argument told when | was condemned and | told my lawyer, who was a lawyer of the opposition at this time and his name was ??</sentence><sentence id="30">Mar,,?</sentence><sentence id="31">| told him to go tomorrow to see the French Commander, | think that because of the embarrassing situation he asked for " interruption ".</sentence><sentence id="32">| called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said | will be released because they announced it immediately that this was the decision, the next step would be the trial and we had prepared documents, as at this time we did not want a trial of the slap but the trial of Keisinger.</sentence><sentence id="33">| went to the Center of Jewish Documentation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, there in the history section worked Joseph Billick??</sentence><sentence id="34">Who had done Russian studies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Philosophy and Mathematics, was a historian in the <span class="BUILDING">Center</span> and | asked: was | right to slap Kiesinger for his past?</sentence><sentence id="35">And he said YES, and he came with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to be a moral witnwss, the Doctors were so afraid that now as a historian he would be allowed to talk about the Nazi Party, so they cancelled for the time being stating that it would take a couple of months, then W. Brandt came to power and | was amnestied, but | continued to work against Kiesinger because he was running for President of the Legislative body in 69, | slap him in 68 on November 7, and | joined the Leftist Party, the Communist Student Peace Movement and | said | will be in the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> that Kiesinger was running for in the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> and | was an official candidate able to follow him in the National campaign and where he came to speak | was there with my friends and we started shouting Kiesinger a Nazi and he had to resign and finally his party lost, he had to leave and W, Brandt replaced him.</sentence><sentence id="36">Even then not only my slap but my campaigh, and at this timel had not succeeded before to mobilize the German Youth, the slap was a big thing because, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, at the end of the Congress, the Youngs had not succeeded on the issue that the Congress should not take place and for them the slap was a satisfaction, | had a lot of students of the left behind me and at the meetings he could not speak because the shouts and rumors of the student's opposition and | guess it had made an impression on the German public.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="37">Q | believe your article from Combat in which you praised W.Brandt was somehow premonitory because what he did later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> show you were right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Yes, certainly, and at the time W. Brandt was already out and had tried several times to become Chancellor and had a lot of problems and | was leading a campaign for him in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, for W</sentence></p><p><sentence id="39">Q | would like to go back for 1 second to the moment of the slap, were you afraid?</sentence><sentence id="40">It was an act of courage.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Much more afraid to succeed, in the time before | was able to??,,?</sentence><sentence id="42">Must act in the moment, | was not sure I'll have the courage, not courage the reflex to slap, because if you are in front of a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, a lot of people and you have to slap a man because at this time for me he was a Nazi, but if you slap a man before you, so, but in the moment you have to act we never failed because it is the whole preparation, at the beginning we were completely alone and now we had a group around us, sons and daughters of the deported Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, but we always were alone and had to prepare the files, do research, tie our leaflets, we never had a Press Attache who said Mrs. Karsfeld you have to go to this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, it was always by ourselves, you have as they say in French " debrouiller" an this was so.</sentence><sentence id="43">END OF FIRST TAPE.</sentence><sentence id="44">RG50-498-0011-02-05</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: So you can say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiesinger</span> was your first case?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Yes, it was it was my first case and the most spectacular and certainly the most important for me as a German because it was the slap given by all the Germans who fought with me against him and it was the slap against the Nazi generation, and as | always say even killing Kiesinger would not had the impact on public opinion as a slap, because it was in relation to thos who had voted for him who had decided to vote for him as a Premier Minister, and | think it is something | never accomplished again and it was a decision of the moment, it succeeded and for that I'll certainly end up in German history and though the German Politicians of today generation are very much opposed, even today, to the gesture; but | also became known in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and among the Jewish world, was proposed for a Nobel Peace Prize, | think that this gesture in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has shown that there is a new generation as W. Brandt and | could not have prepared myself for this from books, but could prepare with " civil courage" as they say in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and | succeeded.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: It was very symbolic!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Yes, it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: Am | correct to say that the next case was the Achenbacker case blocking the nomination of Achenbacker to the Economic European Committee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Can you describe for us this case, please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: As we had worked out the documents, we saw that Achenbacker was in the German Rmbassy, in the Political service and had been sending Telexes concerning the deportation of French Jews and Foreign Jews, and had signed telegrams, so we had known, we met the name of Achenbacker in the archives together with the search about Kiesinger and then we learned after W. Brandt becme Chancellor and was part of the Liberal Party in the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> and Achenbacker was a member of the Liberal Party, he had to make some processes in order to have a big coalition, so we said a man like Achenbacker cannot be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> together with all those from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which had been ruled by German occupiers and it has to be a morality and we cannot take as a German Commissioner a man like Achenbacker, and | collected all the documents concerning Achenbacker and | went to see 6 members of the German Economic Unit and | went to see them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and said you know we have to take a decision and finally under the scandal the Germans said Mr. Achenbacker is replaced by Mr. Arendorf who became, up io ioday the Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">So again, it was our decision to do something in order to avoid that a Nazi could be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> to change the spirit of the European Committee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: If my recollection is correct you were not arrested in the Achenbacker case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: No, | took my son Arno, at that time he was small.</sentence><sentence id="73">When | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where | had my meetings, campaigning against Kiesinger, my Mother-in- Law was often in charge of Arno when | was away, so | decided to take him with me, he was with me against Kiesinger.</sentence><sentence id="74">| remember there was a picture in the German newspapers, the 3 more important candidates, it was Kiesinger, Klafster and Brandt, and Karsfeld was Arno.</sentence><sentence id="75">Even when we followed Kiesinger in the campaign, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> of journalists following his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> and | with some of my group in 1 or 2 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, and the journalists said : " you know why Mrs. Karsfeld had to follow, we could take her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with the media which could be a good gesture, but | am afraid that Arno could bite me."</sentence></p><p><sentence id="76">Q It was nice historically, if | may say so, to name your son after your Father-in-Law who perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: This is Jewish law and my daughter is named after an aunt, sister of my mother-in-law who also died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">When my daughter was born she was called Lidia but the diminutive was Lida and my daughter is called Lida.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Am | correct to say that in 1970 you were jailed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and in 1971 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Yes, at this time | have to tell you that | became known in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> by the fact of documents concerning Kiesinger and documents | had from the Propaganda Ministry and these documents had been in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Postdam</span> and when we started the Kiesinger campaign we did not want to go to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and could tell their spies, so my husband went to the police in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and to the Ministry of Justice to say: my wife was fired from the <span class="BUILDING">German Office</span> because she said that Kiesinger was a Nazi and now we have to prove it.</sentence><sentence id="84">| have to go to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> because the documents are there.</sentence><sentence id="85">| have to tell you | am not sympathetic of <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and | am not a spy but | have a need for the documents, but so you know East Germans are very happy to have young germans taking the German Capitalists men and the German Nazi Party but also had theirNazis, not so important, and after the end of the war when the Russians came most of the Nazis told the anticommunists left <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> and part of them went to the Western Allies.</sentence><sentence id="86">Because of my Kiesinger campaign | became a heroine and after Kiesinger was defeated we turn to the Eastern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we saw there was anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mainly at the trial against the Nazis, the government said that the biblical names of these youngsters were Jewish in order to say Jewish spirit and so | decided first to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> to protest against the anti- Semitism of the Polish government, and for sure | was arrested, expelled the next day because | was an embarrassment for them and | repeated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> on the <span class="DLF">Wenceslaus square</span>, was arrested and this time put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for 2 days and expelled and then | came back to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> the day | heard the <span class="DLF">doors</span> are closed.</sentence><sentence id="87">They did not want to take me back because | was not right to protest against anti- Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and so | said: you know | am nit asking because | want to have a review for you, | have my own propositions and my own morality to fight against Nazis and you share my views, but to fight against anti-Semitism you have to share my views too and we are all Germans, East Germans too you belong to the German people, you are living today in the <span class="REGION">Eastern part</span> but all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declare the war and the Jews and there was no more sharing my views and | said this must be all Germans fighting agains Nazis and not allow former Nazis to have important functions and to fight against anti-Semitism and to stand on the side of the State of Israel and you know what was the situation oflsrael if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> in the end voted against it and | took my liberty even | became ????</sentence><sentence id="88">but | am independent and | will always do all what my only conviction ask me to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: The Lischka case was about his high responsibility for the fate of the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the German who had helped with the Vichy government had decided the arrest and deportation of the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, 76,000 were deported, and after the Achenbacker case we learned that Brandt was signing a new treaty with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in order to obtain the possibility to dash the discriminaters of the 200 sentences after the war by the <span class="BUILDING">military courts</span>, but there were no ways to sentence them because as German citizens in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they asked to extradite them, but as German citizens they were not expelled to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, at this time the <span class="BUILDING">French Military Courts</span> could still sentence them, and the French after the war had in a first review asked the German not to take care of them because they were afraid that sentencing them, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="BUILDING">military courts</span> in absentia, to life in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or to death, but never caught, but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> sentencing them to life, so there was a kind of blocking therefore no sentences in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">We had to find a solution.</sentence><sentence id="104">The treaty between both <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> was signed and now needed the ratification by the German Parliament and who was blocking this ratification our friend Achenbacker leader of our Party, lobbying to stop all persecutions of these criminals, so we started a campaign to, with slightly illegal actions, we showed the big scandal and we started to assemble around us militants, Jews, fighters, deportees, and our action was to oblige first the German Parliament to ratify the treaty and the needs then went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to demonstrate in front of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> stating that Lischka was the former Chief of Police in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, he was already the Chief of the Gestapo in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>; in order to obtain the ratification, friends, young Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> demonstrated about the real criminals, ex-criminals to be put in <span class="BUILDING">German jails</span> or expelled whatever but nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="105">The public opinion and the press at this time was much more favorable to us stating that the situation was not supportable, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> also said how is it possible that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> lets the criminals free and and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> you can imgine the Press, and we had a couple of years to fight and finally the treaty was ratified, Mr. Achenbacker was expelled from his position as President of Commission of Foreigh Affairs and then we had to struggle again with the German Justice yo obtain the trial of Lischka who was a former Chief with Eichman and ?</sentence><sentence id="106">Einseimer?</sentence><sentence id="107">who was the deputy to the Chief of anti-Jewish, was a young man, all had been brilliant men who had studied Philosophy or Journalism and he was one of the worst physically because he arrested elderly Jews, took them from <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Hospitals</span> and he was in charge of children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> before their deportation.</sentence><sentence id="108">So we worked from 1971 when the treaty between <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was signed to 1979 when the trial was open in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">We had conducted several demonstrations putting our lives in danger but finally obtaining Justice for the criminals, we collected all the documents giving them to the French Prosecutor and to the German Prosecutor and finally the trial started.</sentence><sentence id="110">It was important, there were thousands of Youngsters coming from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, in front of the trial and we had shown our determination we will never tolerate an acquittal of these three men, we asked for their sentence.</sentence><sentence id="111">You asked aboit the kidnapping of Lischka , | said that from 1971 to 1979 we acted and when the situation was blocked | said : you know we are to kidnap Lischka and we will bring him back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">Military Courts</span> can still sentence him in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, as we never been professional kidnappers, nor some young Jews, | had pre[pared a controlling timetable of Lischka, when he left in the morning to go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, coming back for lunch, going back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, with some information we had we rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for kidnapping because it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sport car</span>, you can imagine how to put a big man in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sport car</span> and then the first attempt was done, doing it was not determined to hit Lischka so it failed, the group came back in the morning because we did not want to give up, that made a big scandal, people watching that we wanted to kidnap this man and we all returned to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we sent a letter to the German Prosecutor saying you know there was a group of Jews who wanted to kidnap a man like Lischka who was a Nazi criminal so they had to do something, they were very embarrassed because they had known about Lischka in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, and | said you know if you do not want to do something | can come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and tell you what to do, and | came with documents, presented myself to the Prosecutor saying here | am, so he was obliged to arrest me, so | was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, ths was always to push a case of another criminal to be condemn not because we had sent a petition to the German Parliament or to the German Jutice, but because we had put our determination, our own comfort and our own life on the spot in order to obtain this.</sentence></p></dialogue>

dictator, Assad is a dictator, an Arab dictator, he has a sympathy for Alois Brunner, because he knows quite well where he is, and also we had no support from western politicians, mainly as <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: It was my son who took over to represent most of the associated plaintiffs in the case of Paul Touvier, but | remember it was about 20 years ago, he was still hiding with a group of (???)</sentence><sentence id="276">International League against ???</sentence><sentence id="277">anti Semitic, he was still living near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chambery</span> we were demonstrating in front of his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but he had already left because he was hiding among the ?</sentence><sentence id="278">integrus?</sentence><sentence id="279"><span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span>, they were harboring him, he had already at this time to protest???????and he was amnestied by President Pompidoul at this time as you remember President Mitterand also had said in different cases no more trials against French Collaborators, of French High Officials in order not to embarrass the Civil Peace in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, that was the explanation given, not to divide the French population pro and anti Vichy and so we started at this time and ha was arrested and even though when arrested in the South part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the Police from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> came over because the Police of the Cote D'Azur did not want yo act, there was information going around , because the Police told us the KLARSFELD GANG will come and kidnap him, so the Police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, so our fame, but the most important | think is the trial when my son defended most of the associated plaintiffs.</sentence><sentence id="280">It was stated that: In the case he decided to execute the Jews because they were Jewish and in this case he did not act under the Germans but took this direction himself and this was a big struggle for the defending line of Paul Touvier who was sentenced to life imprisonment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
