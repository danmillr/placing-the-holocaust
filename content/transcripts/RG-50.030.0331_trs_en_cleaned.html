<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">HAROLD ZISSMAN May 24, 1995</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Before we get into some of the specific battles, I wanted to ask you a few general questions about when you were with the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="4">It seemed like there were a lot of different groups.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="7">How coordinated were you all?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: Talking about 1943, at that particular time, there was a total coordination.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: You mean, when the Soviets came in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I mean, when we had contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="14">Q: Prior to that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: But prior to that, there were a lot of groups on their own.</sentence><sentence id="17">Be that they were fighting for the same cause, when I mean the same cause, I mean that there were Soviet partisans.</sentence><sentence id="18">Or at the same time, there were other type of partisans which I had before mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="19">We used to call them "the white."</sentence><sentence id="20">When we talk about Soviets, we always talk about red, so, therefore, the white Poles, for instance, those were Polish partisans who were against the Soviets, while they also were against the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="21">And to top it all off, they also were against the Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: This is the AK?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: That was the AK, which is called Army Krajowa.</sentence><sentence id="31">In other words, the land army or nationalist army, which they were.</sentence><sentence id="32">And they really had, to the best of my knowledge, they were very much supported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">That they were, because Chechovky (ph) was one of them, which it was the former marshal sort of in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">And there were people who were -- the Polish, who were saved from the outbreak of war who retreated to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And from there they sort of carried on a certain amount of work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: You had contact with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Well, we had contact with them, be that we, that we got some of their guys sort of by way of surrounding them and knowing what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="45">It was our job to know who the enemy was.</sentence><sentence id="46">And really who the enemy was, besides the Germans, was a big story to tell about it, because they had implants in all of these here ways in order for them to know what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="47">And every once in a while, as I aforementioned in my other chapters, was that we located some prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="48">We found prisoners who sort of came -- we knew there were many POWs who joined the ranks of the partisans that were specific spies, German spies, implants.</sentence><sentence id="49">And we learned how to discover the way they were signified by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="50">They would have a tatoo maybe underneath the arm just like the Gestapo would have.</sentence><sentence id="51">And some of them, which for hiding purposes, when we started to undress them, we found maps that they were carrying with them.</sentence><sentence id="52">And we knew that a guy who escapes a Prisoner of War Camp is not equipped with a map, and he's not equipped with a compass or anything like that because that would have been foolish to think.</sentence><sentence id="53">So that suspicion -- and believe me, we made them talk.</sentence><sentence id="54">The command made them talk, and this is how we knew of the various <span class="NPIP">groups</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Before going too long, I would like to mention at this point here that my wife lost a brother to one of these here AK types you already identified them by their name, or I call them the National Polish Partisan Group.</sentence><sentence id="56">But he and another young kid -- they both were of the age of 14, 15, and their best job to be invisible at their work is because they were kids.</sentence><sentence id="57">And their job used to be more to go, as we call them, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">They would look through main rails, and those kids, they were not so visible -- and plant a <span class="DLF">mine</span> over there and then go off.</sentence><sentence id="59">And then there would be other explosions.</sentence><sentence id="60">They were caught by this, which it was on the other side of <span class="COUNTRY">Niemen</span>, as we called it.</sentence><sentence id="61">The other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">And they were caught up, and needless to say, that they were immediately recognized to be Jews.</sentence><sentence id="63">And for that reason alone, they were killed and shot.</sentence><sentence id="64">Nothing else, you know.</sentence><sentence id="65">So first their being kids.</sentence><sentence id="66">Second, they were partisans, maybe the priority would have been Jews -- that they were Jewish, and that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="67">So evidence like this, it was known to us.</sentence><sentence id="68">As I will enter a little bit later, telling you on one time that we were purposely sent like masqueraded in disguise of the Polish partisans because our command definitely wanted to implant partisans on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> and we were on a search missions, which I will tell it when I come to this part of talking about , yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: What I'm trying to understand is that -- there were different groups that were Soviet partisans.</sentence><sentence id="95">Before everything was coordinated through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, was there any order to this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="98">Was there any coordination?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: It was coordination that a command would meet sometimes together and talk about certain work and plans, if it was planned a coordinated attack.</sentence><sentence id="100">So this guy would be on flanked, and this partisan would use so many men, the other one.</sentence><sentence id="101">So to say that there was coordination, yes.</sentence><sentence id="102">But it wasn't the kind of coordination by command and so on.</sentence><sentence id="103">In other words, a staff was organized in 1943 before we made full contact with the paratroopers that were sent to us.</sentence><sentence id="104">Because at the same time, which I must tell you, in that same year a little bit later, drops from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> through the night became visible even in our <span class="REGION">area</span>, while before it used to be just in the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">But they would drop to us supplies, and with these supplies came messages, and so on in the same way.</sentence><sentence id="106">The supplies were weapons mostly.</sentence><sentence id="107">Not so much that it was of foodstuff or anything like that, but that was -- and later on in "43, we had radio operators with us who were in constant contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, as well as the other outposts of staff.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: While we're on this, well, you might as well tell me how things changed in "43, because this seems to be where we're headed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Well, I touched base in earlier part, but here specifically, for instance, when we're talking about the attack, where we attacked the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruda Slaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">This was already an organized from all, because the participation was flanked by all the partisans in maybe located in 30-mile distance -- 30 mile, I mean square mile -- throughout all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">But various groups were brought in, be that they were ambushed, be they were in the fighting, and it was a real preplanned because for the first time, we were shown off at that time a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer truck</span> and we were shown up at that particular time -- that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer truck</span> drove in in the vicinity nearby.</sentence><sentence id="122">Not exactly.</sentence><sentence id="123">And the first shot was fired from a cannon, which it was something again hard to believe that we mustered that, but it was done because we heard originally before attack that they built up <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">Now, to specify who they are, which is found on the map, that would have been on the main <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">The main <span class="DLF">road</span> we're talking about was a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">It was not a real <span class="DLF">road</span> to the extent of the <span class="DLF">woods road</span>, what we mean.</sentence><sentence id="127">And it was leading between the between towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gotha</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Osweja</span>, and from there you used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.883333" long="25.3">Lida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">So, in other words, it was all dividing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with that <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">And there settlements away from the <span class="DLF">road</span>, not too far, where farmers used to have their <span class="DLF">farms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">And mostly the soil over there was not too good for other than to grow potatoes on.</sentence><sentence id="131">So these farmers, their livelihood came in normal times that they used to work in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, be lumberjacks, or so on.</sentence><sentence id="132">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruda Slaska</span>, there was also plains where they used to make turpentine and tar, which it was again a derivative from this here pine trees that were growing over there.</sentence><sentence id="133">So that was implied a good way for us to make that we could sort of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> -- we were all limited for miles and miles away, without <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">That was the main important issue to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="135">There was only one leading <span class="DLF">road</span>, and that <span class="DLF">road</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruda Slaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">And, as I said preceding this here chapter, while I was speaking of the attack that we had on the Russian and that there came back reinstalled a new now <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in the Russian.</sentence><sentence id="137">At the same time, while we retreated, as I aforementioned, they put up that <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruda Slaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138"><span class="BUILDING">Ruda Slaska garrison</span>, while it was serving the <span class="REGION">area</span>, was basic a service area for the Germans to control the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And, therefore, they chose over that to be Ukrainians, which they were former -- they were with General Lassov (ph), an army who turned around, and instead of fighting the Germans, joined the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="140">And the Germans made their darned best to utilize to their advantage General Lassov's (ph) army, so that <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>, while it had I am sure some Germans in it too, was basically Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="141">Where, again, the Ukrainian language versus the Soviet language is sort of similar to each other, so it was -- and we had in our midst a lot of Ukrainians, who were former Soviet fighters, rather soldiers who did not want to retreat or become POWs and remained in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">Because, as I said, that was a party out of the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="143">So, therefore, it was for the Germans a new kind of thing to bring in an enemy who it was harder for us to control, because they knew they were permitted Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="144">They didn't necessarily have to speak German while they learned already to speak German.</sentence><sentence id="145">So that became the biggest, sort of in a way, a trap to our existence because it was too close for comfort.</sentence><sentence id="146">They could, for instance, if they wanted to make an attack of artillery on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> they could have at any given time, you know, attack with certain shells.</sentence><sentence id="147">And you don't know which way or where, but it would have definitely made a big problem to the farmers and to us.</sentence><sentence id="148">So that's when the command decided not to wait what is going to be later, but they by all costs, which I mean cost of lives, that we must attack and we must destroy that <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">First of all, that no other <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> should be planted around, sort of in that -- and we organized.</sentence><sentence id="150">Again, it was already the staff, the General's staff, which was controlling and they brought in forces from all kinds and the innovation, like I said, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">artillery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Panzer trucks</span>, sort of as to call it, was issued there.</sentence><sentence id="152">It was a hard battle for us for the first time to ensue because supplies of ammunition were hard for us.</sentence><sentence id="153">It was either to buy food or to buy horse, that they could supply to us.</sentence><sentence id="154">And no matter how much ammunition we all carried with us, we never carried enough ammunition to ensue a battle three or four hours.</sentence><sentence id="155">And that's what the battle was, and we succeeded -- only because of that artillery fight, we succeeded to drive them out.</sentence><sentence id="156">Meaning, they retreated, so they came back at a time later and restarted again.</sentence><sentence id="157">But our satisfaction was that we showed the enemy, well, you have no safety ground over here.</sentence><sentence id="158">And from there on, the miserable life ensued until liberation.</sentence><sentence id="159">It was the last year, sort of, for us of the war, and we were talking about the year right now, let's say, between August of 1943 to about August 1944.</sentence><sentence id="160">But those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> a year later became liberated by the Red Army.</sentence><sentence id="161">So that was the hardest year to survive as a fighting or partisans at all in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: But that, too, the fact that at this time everything was coordinating through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">You were able to get more and better supplies, and that there was really system, I guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="210">And a command.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="214">How did that change the way you operated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="218">Before a command of a group, as I said, firstly the names have changed.</sentence><sentence id="219">It was no longer Zychov's (ph) group or Bullock's (ph) group or Fredia Kommunarsk's group.</sentence><sentence id="220">All of sudden, there was names, for instance, at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="221">We started to hear organizing of the kids.</sentence><sentence id="222">We started to hear Russian names of heroes.</sentence><sentence id="223">You know what I mean, to be named, you know what mean?</sentence><sentence id="224">And this is the way it had gone on to a total change that the Soviet ties to the all extent that even the name.</sentence><sentence id="225">The other innovation was that all of a sudden, it began to get the commissars.</sentence><sentence id="226">And the commissars, as you have probably heard over about it, they were political commanders.</sentence><sentence id="227">So while even at a time as we were, we still had to give our ears to these political commissars.</sentence><sentence id="228">To hear the stories of Communism and Socialism and what their aim is and all of that.</sentence><sentence id="229">So this was a big kind of innovation that it's sort of in a way unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="230">How was it going to happen?</sentence><sentence id="231">Yes, it did.</sentence><sentence id="232">In other words, no matter what we were exposed to, we must have been exposed to politicizing the situation in the same way.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="233">The second -- the third change was -- I already said the name changed, the command post and so on.</sentence><sentence id="234">The third was that from now on, no commander was a commander that he made his own decisions.</sentence><sentence id="235">Any operation, even for instance, the <span class="REGION">territory</span> was divided from where we draw our supplies and which type of farmers could we come to get supplies from.</sentence><sentence id="236">In other words, sort of not attack our own.</sentence><sentence id="237">So before it was we knew the <span class="REGION">area</span>, the commander knew, for instance, in these here <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> don't go barter because we got too many of our own people.</sentence><sentence id="238">So we don't even go to ask them not to give food.</sentence><sentence id="239">We would come and take, let's say, cattle or whatever it is, and give them a receipt, so that when the Red Army came, you will be paid for it.</sentence><sentence id="240">We knew it's not -- you know what I mean, but that was the way it went on, sort of to make it official, other than it used to be saying we robbed the farmers for food.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="241">Well, too, I don't say you don't because certain times like when the situation was bad, we were blockaded, we couldn't help it; we had to carry things on on our own.</sentence><sentence id="242">But in the most of the cases, the <span class="REGION">territory</span> was divided that this and this companies go for their needs here and there.</sentence><sentence id="243">And other <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> use someplace else, and that's the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="244">When a battle needed to be organized, it was decided in the general staff.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Was this an improvement or a problem?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: As a Jew we feel it improved one thing, that we sort of felt we were not an open prey.</sentence><sentence id="247">That there's more authority; however, individually meeting up as used to call them the "Easterners" was touching.</sentence><sentence id="248">That's how we used to refer to them.</sentence><sentence id="249">Those who were the paratroopers who were thrown down.</sentence><sentence id="250">Jokes still went on.</sentence><sentence id="251">We saw a big change, the came to be used to show off the command of a lieutenant or captain, while before they used to make them on the collar, you know what I mean the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="252">So we saw a new, different insignias.</sentence><sentence id="253">Different changes.</sentence><sentence id="254">But above all, our fear for anti-Semitism, we felt -- because we had, for instance, in our midst talking about the political commissar, Captain Bavidoff (ph), and he was leading his group which it was strictly a political commissar with printing little newsletters and all of this.</sentence><sentence id="255">And he was Jewish himself, sort of, you know, it's sort of you felt you have somebody who you can depend on.</sentence><sentence id="256">So to put it together in capsule, anti-Semitism, perhaps, changed to be a little bit less because of that.</sentence><sentence id="257">However, it still was in there.</sentence><sentence id="258">It was a poison ivy that we couldn't get rid of it, and we couldn't get rid of it as far as identifying many instances.</sentence><sentence id="259">And maybe we were too much in pain to accuse easily anti-Semites, but it was not just easily.</sentence><sentence id="260">It was many, many subjects that either were bold enough to see that it was anti-Semitism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: But it got better?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: So what happened next?</sentence><sentence id="282">I know we've these events to talk about, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Well, the Ruda-Slaska battle, as you see, I capsulized it very small because I don't want to take up.</sentence><sentence id="286">And the next battle will be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: But let me just ask you a question.</sentence><sentence id="290">At some point later you joined the Red Army, but this was -- no, you didn't?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: What do you mean?</sentence><sentence id="294">I personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: No, I never joined the Red Army.</sentence><sentence id="300">No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: I was only along with them from the partisans, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="308">So what do you want to tell me about this next battle?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="310">Just as Ruda Slaska was a very important thing for us to knock out, and we were freed for about a few months, that they were knocked out.</sentence><sentence id="311">So (a) it was satisfaction.</sentence><sentence id="312">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, controlling the other main <span class="DLF">artery</span> which it was a much better <span class="DLF">road</span> -- going through it wasn't like a <span class="DLF">forest road</span> -- was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="313">The Germans managed that after so many miles apart they sort of build garrisons of controlling certain landmarks to be of their own, utilizing the local militia, the local people, which they were in the militia, and few Germans.</sentence><sentence id="314">You got to remember the importance of that particular time, the Germans said to make an elite force out of them.</sentence><sentence id="315">Well, their elite force was to killing the Jews in these here special groups, which they were doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byelorussia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and killing them on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="316">So rounding up Jews to kill from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> or otherwise, that was their elite force.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="325">They had everything one could wish for, and they always were told, "If you don't do that, you're going to be sent to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>."</sentence><sentence id="326">And the sending to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> to face the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> was a big punishment because, as history told us and we know already with Marshal Polis (ph) at that time, which would be the armies which the big rift did happen.</sentence><sentence id="327">And the Soviet's Army at that particular time was fighting really to the bitter end.</sentence><sentence id="328">There was no retreating and no giving up, so if it meant one-on-one fights after when it happened and the Germans retreated, it was that.</sentence><sentence id="329">So the Germans did not have that 10 days with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> that originally the way in "41, that was their slogan.</sentence><sentence id="330">Within 10 days they'll be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">They realized that by 1943 how fast only was how fast are they retreating, and they did not want to retreat faster than they were beat out.</sentence><sentence id="332">So the Germans used to keep that to their forces.</sentence><sentence id="333">Hey, if you're not going to behave well, you go to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">To the <span class="DLF">Russian front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">So a lot of the local people were given a choice.</sentence><sentence id="336">If you do not want to be drafted to go to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, you have a choice to serve in the militia.</sentence><sentence id="337">So a lot of them who did want either escaped and joined the force.</sentence><sentence id="338">So we had another incoming force because of that.</sentence><sentence id="339">And those people became good fighters, because they were fighting for their own local causes.</sentence><sentence id="340">So they built there for, like I said, Ruda Slaska over here.</sentence><sentence id="341"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span>, which it was an ended field say between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonium</span> and on the way like we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.883333" long="25.3">Lida</span>, so that was a big post that they built a big <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">And that <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> was taking care of all of these <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">This was a new trick again that our command devised.</sentence><sentence id="344">That while we wanted to attack <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph), we didn't directly come to attack it there, but we went to attack another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">The other <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a big <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">It was a <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span> over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen River</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Melnitsa</span> was the name of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby.</sentence><sentence id="347">So we sent forces in setting up, you know, <span class="NPIP">places</span> setting up in hiding and I was -- the forces to jump out in case the German police come going there.</sentence><sentence id="348">So we set up ambushes on them, so we came, poured gasoline, naphtha, whatever we could get a hold of, including turpentine on that <span class="DLF">wooden bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">And we started to set a fire.</sentence><sentence id="350">We knew that once that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> is going to go a fire, and that would be dropped a tremendous communication on a main <span class="DLF">road</span> like this here.</sentence><sentence id="351">That the <span class="BUILDING">Cozlo- Chechnya</span> (ph) outpost over there would go, everybody would go out to come there to fight the partisans while putting out the fire at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="352">It worked.</sentence><sentence id="353">No sooner they started to run and that was about 30 miles away.</sentence><sentence id="354">No sooner all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and we saw them in from Lida posts.</sentence><sentence id="355">The way they're starting to run towards that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that we set a fire, we attacked them.</sentence><sentence id="356">And then easily with a few troops that were left in there, so it was no problem for us to take over.</sentence><sentence id="357">It was one Jew, we used to call him "The Bearded Moses."</sentence><sentence id="358">And he was a short man with a beard and he was the most heroic person known in that battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="359">He by that time had killed about 15 policemen, until the 16 policemen from the back saw it.</sentence><sentence id="360">You know what I mean, that what he is there.</sentence><sentence id="361">He ended him and with a single bullet killed sort of our -- The Bearded Moses.</sentence><sentence id="362">And he was well known in the <span class="REGION">area</span> for his heroism and so on.</sentence><sentence id="363">So, as I started to say, we captured; we had a big battle and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Howitzer</span> was the sounding of time that we sent out.</sentence><sentence id="364">Which again, it was a new type of cannon, and I was at the moment serving near the Howitzer as the second man.</sentence><sentence id="365">And between all the partisans which they were needed to be -- so two parts.</sentence><sentence id="366">It wasn't a matter that this group, that group, all partisans who were on the force were taking place on that battle.</sentence><sentence id="367">And within a few hours, no sooner they found out over there, we told their people coming out, they started to go back.</sentence><sentence id="368">As they started to go back, they were engaged in fire with us, because we attacked them.</sentence><sentence id="369">So it was not just the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="370">They suffered tremendous casualty and they suffered the prestige that once more the partisans were able to come and knock out the major post connecting and even threaten.</sentence><sentence id="371">The <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was burned apart.</sentence><sentence id="372">It took them weeks to have it repaired, so basically our aim, what we wanted, is disrupt German communication and disrupt the going on that they had to bring more forces and use people.</sentence><sentence id="373">So, per se, what we showed the Soviet Union was answered in all ways the way we were doing it.</sentence><sentence id="374">However, this time it was no longer a local job, but was a command coming all the way -- who know, maybe it came even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">I am not equipped to tell you exactly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: A couple of questions for clarification.</sentence><sentence id="428">Can you guess at how many partisans would have been involved in this operation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: I guesstimate that at least it was between 800 to 1,000 partisans.</sentence><sentence id="432">At least, because to cover just basically the <span class="REGION">area</span> even in a thin kind of a way from all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">command posts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="433">We're talking a perimeter of battle that at times lasted for about maybe 10, 15 miles.</sentence><sentence id="434">In other words, they were fighting in one <span class="REGION">area</span> near the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">Then around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cozlo-Chechnya</span> (ph), which it was a small, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but it was quite a garrison established over there.</sentence><sentence id="436">So again, we showed the biggest amount of power as it was previously ever displayed because on direction, we didn't use that much of a force.</sentence><sentence id="437">Ruda Slaska, we didn't use that much of a force.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: So that means these 1,000 or whatever number partisans maybe were broken into companies of a hundred...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: Correct, correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="450">And there were men and women fighting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Were men and women, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: And...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: It stands out to me, one -- Rachel was her name -- and she was with Fania (ph) Kommunarsk.</sentence><sentence id="458">I mentioned the name to him before.</sentence><sentence id="459">Rumor had it she was his girlfriend, and to look at that young lady dressed with a uniform on that horse, it was not so common to our era, you know what I mean, to see a young lady in uniform and horseback riding and be participating in battle.</sentence><sentence id="460">So a lot of these here things became more obvious at this time, that the fighting by young ladies were justified, you know what I mean, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="461">And they were renowned about it, we knew it.</sentence><sentence id="462">We saw it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: Were the women treated differently than the men, than the partisans .. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Well, they were always a female.</sentence><sentence id="472">That still went on, and in any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army</span>, you can understand.</sentence><sentence id="473">A female had her priorities.</sentence><sentence id="474">Of course, the commander when he wanted a girl, she was his girl.</sentence><sentence id="475">You know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="476">So call it what you want to, but the feminine wish or ways, or whatever it is, was very much visible at a particular time.</sentence><sentence id="477">Even when she was riding on a horse.</sentence><sentence id="478">Even though that she was, you know, a good fighter and so on, it still was, on the other hand, that intuition of her feminine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="487">Q: Were women given as much responsibility or different kinds of responsibilities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="489">A: Well, to answer you did we have a commander woman, no.</sentence><sentence id="490">So, obviously, you can understand to judge from here that it was still a man's world and not a woman's world, or equal world.</sentence><sentence id="491">No.</sentence><sentence id="492">However, it was -- in the Russian Army to see women, it was no novelty.</sentence><sentence id="493">We already seen it from "39 when the Soviets came to us.</sentence><sentence id="494">So it was perhaps different than we saw it from the Polish Army from before, but women were in the Soviet Army as an equality marker.</sentence><sentence id="495">So that part talking from a Soviet point of view, if you want to say, it was no novelty.</sentence><sentence id="496">But in the partisans, yes, it was a novelty to see because if I was going to percentage-wise in any company, if they could have been one percent, it was already a big marker.</sentence><sentence id="497">You could find, for instance, in our company there maybe were seven or eight women, and, like I say, the most of them were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="498">Which, you know, where is a <span class="NPIP">woman's place</span>?</sentence><sentence id="499">As sort of saying, it's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">And they were utilized in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="502">Or ina, let's say, as nursing, for instance, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="503">So it was as the past was for placing the women in this kind of a ways.</sentence><sentence id="504">You know what I mean, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: But there were women who were on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> fighting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="523">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="524">In the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet</span> regular army.</sentence><sentence id="525">But with the partisans, depending on the occasion and where.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="529">Q: Well, there's one other thing that confuses me a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="530">When you talk about going into a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> and you use the word, "police," are you talking about local recruits or Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="533">A: Police, whenever we speak, we never referred to Germans.</sentence><sentence id="534">That was local.</sentence><sentence id="535">So being that they used to be called by the Russian name of militia or the German police were organized -- the head of the police was a German.</sentence><sentence id="536">Or there were a few much, which it was jobs for the Germans who maybe were either injured or deserved the rank.</sentence><sentence id="537">That they were not going to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, so from the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, they were given sort of something better.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Change tape.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: But with or without , it was contribution made by the local companies to supply people to join these paratroopers right now on that special mission.</sentence><sentence id="540">I was picked to be one basically because I spoke fluent Polish.</sentence><sentence id="541">Secondly, because I hailed from that <span class="REGION">area</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and with me was another young man.</sentence><sentence id="542">He was a Nordic, blonde hair, and could be easily masqueraded as a non-Jew, which it happened as we shall tell later.</sentence><sentence id="543">That I was sort of in a way almost discovered that I am not what I am supposed to have been because I couldn't hide my face and makeup, we didn't use at the time.</sentence><sentence id="544">So the other boy's name which also was Jewish and he was from my platoon was Polotchik (ph), that's what his name was.</sentence><sentence id="545">And we had local area people join us.</sentence><sentence id="546">One guy who was a graduator of Polish officers" <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Surgay (ph), Surgay Balli (ph).</sentence><sentence id="547">That was his name, he was sort of Polish and white and Russian mixed in him, so either way you would call him Polish would be correct.</sentence><sentence id="548">Russian would be again correct.</sentence><sentence id="549">And, of course, he was fluent in his Polish, and here I'm going to make a point.</sentence><sentence id="550">They asked if anybody has pictures from the past to be a sort of identification to show when we meet up with this here AK underground or Polish underground, that's sort of to prove that we are authentic.</sentence><sentence id="551">So he had a picture in uniform as an officer cadet, and that was while graduating his <span class="BUILDING">officers" school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="552">Which in other times, that would give him -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and is a ticket to be arrested and sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="553">And this time, it served the purpose very well, and he could show it off.</sentence><sentence id="554">So we were four of us from the locals, Surgay (ph) and another guy who was a Polish-speaking white Russian, and I and then it was Polotchik (ph).So the rest eight of them, including the commander of our group, were all easterners, as we call them or referred to them, or paratroopers that were dropped.</sentence><sentence id="555">And they are disguised to say that they joined the Polish Army in protest against the Communists and, therefore, they're willing to give their life to fight with the Polish for the cause, that they are anti- Communist.</sentence><sentence id="556">So it sort of was a supportive kind of thing, and every one of us was made up like the documents, so it was really produced like in legal kind of a manner and way.</sentence><sentence id="557">And once we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span>, we started to go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we made our way up south, sort of that we knew in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> that there were more white Poles that were operating by night as partisans.</sentence><sentence id="558">By day, they were doing their regular work be as farmers, or whatever their work took.</sentence><sentence id="559">And from talking and inquiries, we found out to make the contact to somebody, and we all, therefore, did not go in.</sentence><sentence id="560">But it was just Surgay -- per se, it used to be Surgay and the commander or two would go in from the easterners, or rather the paratroopers.</sentence><sentence id="561">And I or would be in there because it's supportive evidence to carry on a good conversation in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="562">The Russian at the time would keep quiet because he did not speak Polish.</sentence><sentence id="563">So this is the way our contact was made and the groundwork was laid.</sentence><sentence id="564">They took it for all the scripture that we told them that we are coming from around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and we are trying to establish here a Polish partisan.</sentence><sentence id="565">In other words, that we will be able to help create because, you know, since there are surrogate partisans so we want to be on our side and do our work.</sentence><sentence id="566">And we used to be led from one <span class="DLF">pool</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="567">Transportation was provided by us, horses -- it was horseback riding.</sentence><sentence id="568">And at times, it did entail about a whole night riding on a horseback, just having something covered on the horses.</sentence><sentence id="569">Did not have no saddles or anything like this here, so it was -- when you got off that horse, you walked 0 around like in a barrel.</sentence><sentence id="570">You couldn't stretch out, and that was part of it.</sentence><sentence id="571">In our weapons we had at that time we had some automatic and the majority was end-shooters, automatic pistols and so on.</sentence><sentence id="572">So we didn't show a lot of weapons we'd ask for, for whatever reason it was.</sentence><sentence id="573">And on one of these here occasions, it must have been maybe the third day and we used to were trained and told that whenever you entered a <span class="BUILDING">Polish house</span>, you're going to have to cross heart, you have to kneel to say your prayers.</sentence><sentence id="574">You had show the whole rigmarole that it looks like authentic, and you cannot go away.</sentence><sentence id="575">And this is what it was, the Polish system and the Polish star, and all of us including myself as much as it hurt me to say some of those words.</sentence><sentence id="576">But for lifesaving idea, you do a lot of things that you ask forgiveness, you know, in your heart.</sentence><sentence id="577">But you do it in order to survive and I did it.</sentence><sentence id="578">Again, it was the food eating kind, it's they were serving pork and more pork.</sentence><sentence id="579">And to us, it was a novelty of having this food served because it was not like that.</sentence><sentence id="580">They went their normal way.</sentence><sentence id="581">And drinking, of course, rum.</sentence><sentence id="582">One of these nights we then first had to say our prayer.</sentence><sentence id="583">We sat behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, drinking had started with moonshine and Polish Vodka, you know, that some of it was shown to us.</sentence><sentence id="584">And the host which was sitting across like from me at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and he says in Polish, " Pu which it means, "You know what?</sentence><sentence id="585">To me, it looks like he's a Jew."</sentence><sentence id="586">I controlled my emotion not to turn colors and quick, Surgay , as I said Surgay, what you call it, picked up this conversation and says, "You know, it's funny you should say it," he says to him, "because he's a Georgian."</sentence><sentence id="587">And the makeup of the Georgian people, which Stalin was one of the Georgian, would be of the dark skin.</sentence><sentence id="588">And a lot of them could be taken, you would take for -- they liked the long sideburns which I did wear long sideburns sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="589">If 1 would have, it would have been an appropriate image to portray that that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="590">But here was a fast-acting period that took place, and he took over and I did not want to get in involved with talking.</sentence><sentence id="591">Basically, trembling <span class="NPIP">inside</span> as to what it is, so it went away smooth and the evening was ended.</sentence><sentence id="592">However, when our evening had ended and Polotchik, my other guy, was on patrol, because every time we entered a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there two guys on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on patrol watching because no matter how safe they told us to feel, we never knew this surprise that it might ensue or might happen.</sentence><sentence id="593">So afterwards when we get together, I says look, this and this happened.</sentence><sentence id="594">And I believe you ought to know about it, and that's why I'm telling you.</sentence><sentence id="595">I don't tell you from this moment on, neither I will not enter a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="596">However, you must be with me for our own safety, because if we become a danger to our mission, what we're about to do, remember they'll kill us both.</sentence><sentence id="597">So there will be nobody to say that it was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="598">So accidents do happen, you know what I mean, and that could be that.</sentence><sentence id="599">So it was honestly an awakening and vice-versa because now on, it was guard each other.</sentence><sentence id="600">The reason I'm telling you that that this is how anti-Semitism was penetrating, as I mentioned a few times before, that in your own, no matter how safe you wanted to feel, you did not have that safety feeling that you do not have to watch.</sentence><sentence id="601">Because we know from experience of how many Jews were killed, which how do you describe it, that it was not an accident?</sentence><sentence id="602">You have to have the proof to prove it, and there was no one to question this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="668">Q: But you were talking about with...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polotchik</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="674">Q: ... Polish.</sentence><sentence id="675">That's different than within your group.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="678">A: Yes, but I was talking to him one-on-one at this particular time, and he understood it and he joined with me.</sentence><sentence id="679">And from there on until the end of that mission ended, which we were traveling around and we were already nearing the <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="680">But the fact remains that while our command suspected that the Polish partisans and the National Polish partisans where a resistance became very understandable to us, and they are visible.</sentence><sentence id="681">And they had an easier way of operating because they did not have -- you know, the Germans did not know who, what and where.</sentence><sentence id="682">For as long as the population didn't tell about you, bring you up, you were operating safe.</sentence><sentence id="683">So they could be where they are, do what they want to, and manage to stay away, not to be -- maybe there are people <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the militia.</sentence><sentence id="684">It could be possible, I don't -- I don't doubt that a bit, but since I don't know the facts exactly, I don't wish to dwell on it too much.</sentence><sentence id="685">Until finally our mission ended, it was about 10 days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="694">Q: Let's stop for a second. (</sentence><sentence id="695">noise)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: As easily I talk about it after that, that it ensued and happened at that time, I hope you get my understanding.</sentence><sentence id="699">That every minute of the day was a hard minute to pass because we were really watching ourselves against two enemies.</sentence><sentence id="700">You never know did the Polish really take us for granted or didn't they?</sentence><sentence id="701">And again, let's not forget the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: It doesn't sound like it's getting quieter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="708">A: The 10 days of agony really is not worthy enough a word to use as I said describing our ordeal what we had go through.</sentence><sentence id="709">Being dressed in a Polish uniform, acting something that we are not, and all that rigmarole going through with it, prayers.</sentence><sentence id="710">Not I nor the Gentiles in our group were praying type of people in those days at all.</sentence><sentence id="711">Especially being from the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="712">So all this here was -- I don't know to say what it was the worst part of it.</sentence><sentence id="713">But one thing which I did not say it, and I want to tell it.</sentence><sentence id="714">I disclosed the situation to the commander of our group.</sentence><sentence id="715">In another word way, I spoke to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polotchik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="716">I says, "You know," I didn't want to use because of it, "I don't mind it to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> any time that we go into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or anything like this here.</sentence><sentence id="717">In other words, to be on patrol."</sentence><sentence id="718">And that was a well-taken word because this is the worst you can ask for, to be on patrol.</sentence><sentence id="719">In case of trouble, you're the first one to die.</sentence><sentence id="720">So they didn't mind it, and especially these guys <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, it will be a drink and so on.</sentence><sentence id="721">And I did not mind it at all to forsake it.</sentence><sentence id="722">And our mission, as Polish partisans, was nearing and we politely took our uniforms off, burned them so there should be no recognition or anything like that whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="723">And now, we ensued to find a new <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to find is there any partisans at all in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="724">We ran up on a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, what they called it ; which it means "The Holy Mud" place which it was, it was almost.</sentence><sentence id="725">And while going through this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and speaking to a Polish person from the <span class="REGION">area</span>, he was the one speaking that telling us as a farmer that there are partisans in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="726">And what we ran up against was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>, but they, as a matter of fact, explained us that regular partisans as many times as they started to act over here, but in a short time later, they sort of get lost, and they don't know the outcome.</sentence><sentence id="727">Be that they got killed, be that they moved to other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="728">But 2 seeing they were using that as a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, they were very cautious and careful to have us come in over there.</sentence><sentence id="729">We needed a guide at that particular time to know the <span class="REGION">area</span>, and we found two of the Jewish people over there who knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> exactly well.</sentence><sentence id="730">And they did not mind to become our guides and be with us for the period that we were.</sentence><sentence id="731">Our mission was at that time, once we turned back in as Soviet partisans, to show the Germans that there are partisans over here.</sentence><sentence id="732">And how could we show it to the Germans or see what kind of reaction comes from them?</sentence><sentence id="733">We went downing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> in a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we had to cut on the posts, just cut the wires and so on.</sentence><sentence id="734">And at one time, we used a new system that we tried.</sentence><sentence id="735">We had already the plastic explosives where we would take and wrap it around so no longer did we have to use a saw to cut it down.</sentence><sentence id="736">But we would wrap around this here and put in a capsule, and from distance turn on -- from distance, turn it on and by one shot, the whole post, the telephone post, would blow up in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">And devise to make it was disrupted, so to us, it was sort of like a fiasco, something we never experienced before in an action.</sentence><sentence id="738">And that's why it was progress that we have seen in a different way of doing those things.</sentence><sentence id="739">Because you could set it off very easily, in a few minutes.</sentence><sentence id="740">Just to wrap around, around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, you know, with a piece the explosive and blow up, in other words, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> like this here.</sentence><sentence id="741">So that was our mission at that time and we did accomplish.</sentence><sentence id="742">We also had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go by rails that we where to explode some rail, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> about it to do.</sentence><sentence id="743">So that was the three things that we were involved in doing: Cutting down the <span class="DLF">telephone poles</span>, disrupting communication, also burned down a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> which it was a connecting small <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in a side <span class="DLF">road</span> and -- which it was leading to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">And also, blow up some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>, which it was -- when I think about blowing up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>, when I think about it, I still shudder.</sentence><sentence id="745">Because we came to that mission, and we really the night before did a lot of drinking.</sentence><sentence id="746">And while the drinking didn't bother me in most cases, at this time -- but all of a sudden, while they used at that particular time, they used to call it a shuntle.</sentence><sentence id="747">This was the rod to clean out your rifles with, and we had to put it in that fender ring so that would serve for the right <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would go by as to be able to go ahead to touch it and make an explosion.</sentence></p></dialogue>

time.</sentence><sentence id="796">We really dressed back -- dressed back in army uniforms of the Russian Army, so this sort of did not have them with us, but we got them.</sentence><sentence id="797">And I'll tell you when.</sentence><sentence id="798">How they got them, I don't even know to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="799">But we got them and we were changed over as Russian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="800">Not fully, but almost.</sentence><sentence id="801">And all of a sudden, I saw that I attached the piece of steel or rather wire, that it was in between that ring which that was the one to trigger it for an explosion.</sentence><sentence id="802">I saw it there, and I don't know -- I didn't know what to say.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="803">Should we run or whatever we should do, some kind of a motion, because -- and calmly we went away.</sentence><sentence id="804">Looks like all the other Jew, there were three of us over there.</sentence><sentence id="805">The other two had seen it at the same time, and we retreated and we went away.</sentence><sentence id="806">Now, we did it like we used to before in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">We retreated about maybe a half a mile away into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and we were waiting for a passing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">Whenever, we did not have a schedule, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in those years did not run on schedule either.</sentence><sentence id="809">Because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military trains</span> had priority and the other priority, which I know it now and I did not know it then, was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> carrying Jews to the 3 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="810">They were the priority number one almost like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trains</span> at that particular time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="811">So -- and we heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in about an hour later, and we were just retreating waiting because we wanted to know the damage.</sentence><sentence id="812">On the other hand, we couldn't even find out where the damage was.</sentence><sentence id="813">So we heard an explosion, so we scored our three-way things that we had.</sentence><sentence id="814">We had a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> blown up, we did that.</sentence><sentence id="815">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which we had accomplished that.</sentence><sentence id="816">The damage what it was, we did not even wait, we retreated from there immediately upon the explosion towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because we were not too well familiar with the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">But we had a map of the <span class="REGION">local area</span> that we obtained, and military map which we knew whereabouts we have to aim because we did not accept to go ahead to ask people our ways around, because we couldn't trust anybody.</sentence><sentence id="818">So all in all, we found out that we knew about this group of people who were in hiding which was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">Special partisans, we didn't make contact with any of them.</sentence><sentence id="820">And we started through a different <span class="DLF">route</span> now to go back to our bases on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">We decided at this time to go in our way without horseback riding as we were going this way, so we knew it's going to be a long haul to it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="822">And it took us -- well, it took us 10 days to go to the mission, we didn't see it.</sentence><sentence id="823">It took us two weeks until we finally came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen River</span> near our <span class="REGION">area</span>, and we had to get somebody with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and a gun that we met, a farmer.</sentence><sentence id="824">We had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that he had, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">canoe</span> more or less, to get us across on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">Seeing that there were 12, it was impossible for all of us to go in.</sentence><sentence id="826">So we spread out like a few guy with machine guns around both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> in case of attack, and once we landed on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, we were doing -- the same group was doing for the others.</sentence><sentence id="827">To take cover until we were all on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="828">There we were on our own terms, we knew our ways around, and we finally came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was set before.</sentence><sentence id="829">And our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was still there because we were prepared that, who know, maybe we did not have no telephones or any communications to know what animals.</sentence><sentence id="830">But it so happened that everything was in place .</sentence><sentence id="831">And of course, our commander did his reporting and we were returning at this time back to our former group.</sentence><sentence id="832">A new group was formed and we were in it.</sentence><sentence id="833">This was the time really that I was named commandeer before commander -- platoon commander before that mission.</sentence><sentence id="834">But now I was assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>, and I was commanding that, and we were right now working, not with the former group of partisans.</sentence><sentence id="835">But we were working right now with the paratroopers.</sentence><sentence id="836">And a new mission had started to ensue which it was taking -- it took us a few months to get all the equipment together.</sentence><sentence id="837">Like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rubber boats</span> were thrown down to us.</sentence><sentence id="838">Not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>, but, you know, the ones that are blown in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and you can go which the army was using.</sentence><sentence id="839">And we prepared a new mission to be established which it looked almost like a <span class="DLF">front line</span> break-through.</sentence><sentence id="840">Do you have this on the tape?</sentence><sentence id="841">How far?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="842">Videographer: We're at 24

that new mission.</sentence><sentence id="845">It was the command from General Castankovich (ph) that was leading it, but our general staff was also involved.</sentence><sentence id="846">And there was more than 1,200 partisans got together near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen River</span>, and at this time we were not looking or worried about who will disrupt us.</sentence><sentence id="847">For the first time as we used to do our missions at night, this mission was done in broad daylight.</sentence><sentence id="848">And as we came and we started on the <span

set up right away alongside that <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> at that time to be ready for attack.</sentence><sentence id="850">All we were wondering where the police or where are the Polish partisans we already knew were in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">The amount of so much armor that we had and the amount of so many people all gathered at one time on both sides of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen River</span> as it happened, because we went through.</sentence><sentence id="852">It would have taken us too long to get through all of it in one <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, so in various perimeters, we used so many people to get across the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="866">We were crossing at this particular time, I with my group at that time were crossing near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City Lida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="867">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.883333" long="25.3">Lida</span> is very -- I would say, kilometer-wise at that particular time, it must have been maybe 30 or 40 kilometers, no more, to Lida that the <span class="DLF">crossing</span> was taking place.</sentence><sentence id="868">And as we came on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, we were given horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, which they were confiscated from farmers and we were going just like a regular army would go.</sentence><sentence id="869">Some of them, we would be walking, but when we were walking, we were not marching scattered out.</sentence><sentence id="870">We were walking in a four across, but it was not next to each other.</sentence><sentence id="871">We were walking so much between each other that if we had to drop, take a position military style, that we were able to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="879">Q: Why was it decided to do this in broad daylight?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: They wanted to show a big force.</sentence><sentence id="882">While previous times they did not want to show -- you go a group of 12, a group of 20, the biggest missions in the partisans were achieved with small groups unless an attack on a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">So right now they wanted -- you know, people exaggerate.</sentence><sentence id="884">When they see 1,200, I'm sure that the word got around that it was probably a force of 2,000 to maybe 3,000.</sentence><sentence id="885">It's a usual way people repeat something like that, it looks bigger.</sentence><sentence id="886">And the command by all price, wanted at that particular time to show a big force.</sentence><sentence id="887">And we were going and we were not stopped or disrupted in any way while we were going at that time through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="888">We didn't go through -- but the newest we had guys on horses to spot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span>, to find out the reaction, what people are talking about it.</sentence><sentence id="889">And they were filling us in that the militia was fleeing small <span class="BUILDING">garrisons</span> or small <span class="BUILDING">militia places</span>, because to them it looked like a breakthrough from the <span class="DLF">front line</span>, and it looks like they landed over here.</sentence><sentence id="890">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, at that particular time -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it was maybe 120, 150 kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="891">They were on ready massed two full divisions equipped to go to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, and they took these few divisions and threw it at us.</sentence><sentence id="892">So we did not even have enough time to get situated in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">Which it was on day three, all of a sudden, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> above and what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> did, the bombs -- was gasoline bombs.</sentence><sentence id="894">So the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> became on fire.</sentence><sentence id="895">Something that it was never done before. (</sentence><sentence id="896">A) The Germans never bombed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>; second, with this type of gasoline bombs.</sentence><sentence id="897">So these gasoline bombs made so much panic that we did not know -- it didn't matter whether on a compass or the map, which way you're going.</sentence><sentence id="898">Because you went to the right, you see more <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> on fire.</sentence><sentence id="899">And with all of this here, by the time that day was over, we were an army demolished in a way.</sentence><sentence id="900">Not from killing, but in small groups.</sentence><sentence id="901">And any of the light armaments like we had the light artillery pieces 5 were all left and mined and a new retreat back started in a new fashion in small groups.</sentence><sentence id="902">End of tape #1 6 Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q: When did this take place?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A: This I remember quite well because it was in December because coming back we know the ice on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen River</span>, there were floating pieces of ice.</sentence><sentence id="928">And I know the time because Christmastime is a visible part, that I remember because it was a big, important thing to remember.</sentence><sentence id="929">But a big disaster happened to us at that time.</sentence><sentence id="930">I do not want to omit a very important story personally that I ensued on that day before the total retreat had started.</sentence><sentence id="931">I was laid out with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> in <span class="DLF">front line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">And when I say, "<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>," I'm talking about 20- something guys.</sentence><sentence id="933">And all we had was two live machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="934">The one on the tripod with a round base was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="935">And the other one was a similar one.</sentence><sentence id="936">In other words, we had 10 shooter rifles.</sentence><sentence id="937">All of a sudden, we heard the roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="938">So the roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, all of that had happened before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> showed up on the scene.</sentence><sentence id="939">I jumped a little bit the gun before.</sentence><sentence id="940">When I heard the roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, I sent one of my guys to tell to the commander of his that it's noticeable, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and what have I got -- what kind of change of command, let's say, new position.</sentence><sentence id="941">Because I told him I don't even have in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> one entire armored gun to shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="942">So what with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rifles</span>, how am I going to shoot against them?</sentence><sentence id="943">And as they became closer, I decided to retreat on my own way without a command, and I went to the commander and told him, I says, "Look, there is infantry walking alongside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and there is at least visible from distance, I had someone climb up on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, and they saw at least six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="944">Because how far can you see, you know what I mean without field glasses or so on.</sentence><sentence id="945">So I says, "I know you probably did not have a chance so I retreated."</sentence><sentence id="946">He says, "How dare you to retreat; we didn't tell you."</sentence><sentence id="947">I says, "Do you think we're going to be able fight against this force?</sentence><sentence id="948">With this, you don't have a chance."</sentence><sentence id="949">It didn't take another minute or two while we were talking, a guy running come in and says, "We are all ordered not to open fire, but we'll retreat.</sentence><sentence id="950">We'll retreat in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> like we came to the force away from where we were laid up alongside that <span class="DLF">road</span>."</sentence><sentence id="951">And as soon nightfall came, my commander brought me into the high command to stand <span class="DLF">trail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="952">I almost thought I am going to be shot.</sentence><sentence id="953">How dare was I to take and retreat my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">platoon</span> on my own?</sentence><sentence id="954">My thing was since I had no ammunition, which it was a fact, to even attack a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, why was I to disclose our position?</sentence><sentence id="955">We would wind up we would have suffered a lot of casualties.</sentence><sentence id="956">It looks like command saw my plea much better than my immediate commander from the company, and was case dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="957">But I was afraid that that was curtains for me at that particular time because I did it on my own.</sentence><sentence id="958">As it turned out to be later, I was allowed, of course, that I made a good decision by retreating my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> to them.</sentence><sentence id="959">Seeing that the command would have come to me anyhow a few minutes later.</sentence><sentence id="960">So then after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> showed on the scene, which it was closer to the afternoon already, and so far they did not start shooting directly.</sentence><sentence id="961">But all of a sudden, it burst out cannon shooting, which probably it was from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> approaching.</sentence><sentence id="962">Although we, by that time, were retreated from the <span class="REGION">area</span> because that looked like the whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was going along the main <span class="DLF">road</span> and the main <span class="DLF">road</span> going, I mean, going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="963">Not a regular <span class="DLF">road</span> to <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="964">And the <span class="DLF">roads</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> were <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> as we can best way express it.</sentence><sentence id="965">But their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, you see, could go through these <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="966">And wherever they stepped on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, they stepped on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="967">They made their own <span class="DLF">roads</span> out.</sentence><sentence id="968">That night the command told us that we are not going to 7 ensue fighting.</sentence><sentence id="969">We are going to retreat back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span>.</sentence><sentence id="970">We do not want to go in groups of more than 10 because groups more than 10 will require too much exposure.</sentence><sentence id="971">And we were to march only by night, and if anyone is caught or whatever it is, it's -- you know what I mean, you're just running.</sentence><sentence id="972">Cannot tell them our mission or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="973">However, we were all asked that each one of us carry at this time more ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="974">So each of them were loaded up with more ammunition on ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="975">We walked and we came there, all right?</sentence><sentence id="976">And only thing was in favor was that it wasn't snowing at that time.</sentence><sentence id="977">It was just cold, but it wasn't snowing.</sentence><sentence id="978">And food became a problem because as we went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, we found blueberries or anything, we couldn't go ahead to have the luxury to stop at farmers until finally a few days later and closer to our <span class="REGION">areas</span>, that's when we began to go eat.</sentence><sentence id="979">When we came near the Niemen, and our group to go across which it was -- I was 10 men or 12.1 believe it was about 12 men with me.</sentence><sentence id="980">And there was another group divided for not so many.</sentence><sentence id="981">Each that we were walking away from each other, but not too far a distance that we couldn't contact with each other.</sentence><sentence id="982">In case a fight ensues, that we could depend on the other one to help us.</sentence><sentence id="983">Either flank them or they would flank us.</sentence><sentence id="984">And when we came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span>, we heard shots coming from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> which later on, we discovered it was our own guys who were patrolling that area of the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span> that they did not know what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="985">And they thought sort of maybe the Poles, the AK, are trying to come on this <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">Because they didn't look like an army, and, therefore, they fired the shots.</sentence><sentence id="987">A few casualties were done, nothing is done to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> but some of the others.</sentence><sentence id="988">And the order was we grabbed horses at that time from farmers, and anybody who was carrying a machine gun was allowed to sit on a horse.</sentence><sentence id="989">Alongside the horse, some other guys were swimming along, because pieces of ice were floating on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="990">And by the time I came over on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Niemen</span>, I managed one thing to do, not to

seeing that I'm alive and keep walking as well as I could until finally reached the first <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="993">When I came into the first <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>, I found plenty more partisans who did probably like myself.</sentence><sentence id="994">The woman of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> availed herself tremendously, and in that <span class="REGION">area</span> people used to have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> which served them in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="995">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> was cooking, for baking as well as for heat.</sentence><sentence id="996">And on top, there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> even to climb up and to sleep there.</sentence><sentence id="997">And since I had to get undressed, she gave me a change of something and put my clothing to dry out.</sentence><sentence id="998">There was moonshine there to drink, so we had a good drink.</sentence><sentence id="999">And on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, I climbed on.</sentence><sentence id="1000">I fell asleep, needless to say, and by later on by morning -- that was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span>, so we didn't worry about because we knew it was clear because it was clear as far as Germans were concerned, the police.</sentence><sentence id="1001">And we started to make our way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, where it was.</sentence><sentence id="1002">So that was from a happy occasion as we marched as soldiers and brave guys to make it believe that it was a breakthrough, all of a sudden, for Christmas it was our dire moment that we did not succeed.</sentence><sentence id="1003">However, command did not stop with their idea.</sentence><sentence id="1004">What they did at this time instead of sending a big group and an army like they did, we were moving in the same amount of people while we were retreating.</sentence><sentence id="1005">In small groups, no bigger companies than 20 people at one time were ordered where in a direction to meet in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1006">And within, I would say, maybe two weeks to three weeks, we had a brand new force organized in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1007">The <span class="DLF">front line</span> -- by that time, I'm talking about in January of 1944 -- the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> began to become visible.</sentence><sentence id="1008">That the Byelorussian, that they 8 were almost at the beginning in January of "44, that the army were entering in certain <span class="NPIP">spots</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1009">And we did not realize that within six, seven months, the army will be here.</sentence><sentence id="1010">We thought all along that maybe once the army becomes near, we would sort of be discharged.</sentence><sentence id="1011">But that was not <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>'s idea or the Soviets saying -- we were at that particular time pushed to go closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1012">They had already their assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1013">I remember vividly that the night before when I went to place a <span class="DLF">mine</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- at that particular time we used a lot <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1014">We, you know, even used <span class="DLF">mines</span> to put on the <span class="DLF">road</span> because the retreating soldiers by the Soviet Army, we did not think that the Red Army is close by.</sentence><sentence id="1015">And I believe that that blowup of that <span class="DLF">mine</span>, that it exploded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that we found out the next day was already that the Red Army is reaching.</sentence><sentence id="1016">I jumped right now -- at least about eight, nine months.</sentence><sentence id="1017">In the <span class="REGION">area</span> where my wife was and the <span class="REGION">area</span> from originally I was with the partisans, they came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> about July, early August.</sentence><sentence id="1018">I, as I said, still we were involved with all of this here things, did not get discharged out of that until sometime in September.</sentence><sentence id="1019">And a new mission was awaiting for me to get started because immediately it was for 10 days that we were -- that the army was fighting the

id="1024">And on top of these <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, they found them -- they placed themselves with glasses and they were able to tell the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> where the artillery is located to how we are to load firing.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And their accuracy was beyond belief.</sentence><sentence id="1026">On the third round, they knocked the battery out.</sentence><sentence id="1027">To the right, to the left, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turbine</span> was in the center and your battery is all to pieces like "</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1139">A: In the winter of -- we are talking in January, February of "44.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And I said God only would have known that about six, seven months later the Red Army would already come in.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: Well, this is six months later or whatever, the Red Army did come in.</sentence><sentence id="1148">In those days, can you -- if you think back, did six months seem like an eternity, or did it. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: Six months, definitely an <span class="NPIP">eternity</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">There is no ifs about it.</sentence><sentence id="1153">Every day was long, but the closer 9 the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> became reaching, the closer we used to see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet airplanes</span> in the <span class="DLF">air</span> flying through because we used to begin to see them now flying through our missions to bomb or so on.</sentence><sentence id="1154">It sort of put in a new <span class="DLF">hole</span> in life.</sentence><sentence id="1155">It was still being possible to believe that really the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> are coming closer to us and the Soviets are returning.</sentence><sentence id="1156">It was only like everybody had one prayer, that we would live to see that.</sentence><sentence id="1157">Because a new way had started in all this force over there.</sentence><sentence id="1158">While we were a way closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>, as I said, in small groups that we were asked to come to this end.</sentence><sentence id="1159">We must have had a force of about 800 partisans over there in various <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1160">The old <span class="REGION">territory</span> from where we descended sort of from, right now began to fill up with retreating Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1161">And the partisans had suffered more casualties in this here last month of the war as they did in two and a half years prior to that.</sentence><sentence id="1162">Because first of all, the army was afraid to retreat by the regular open <span class="DLF">road</span>, so they used the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1163">When they were going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, there was no holy places for them as special by any army.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And they had their equipment, and, of course, the partisans could not help it.</sentence><sentence id="1165">If they ensued in a little fight, the Germans did not stop with a fight because to them regrouping and retreating was more important.</sentence><sentence id="1166">So maybe a fight would ensue, they would look the <span class="DLF">opening</span> where they could do the best and get out.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So that gave the partisans sort of another way of running away.</sentence><sentence id="1168">But there was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And the biggest amount, my best friends that I was to through the years were killed in the last -- in these here ensuing battles of that time.</sentence><sentence id="1170">I came out -- as a matter of fact, not to jump it.</sentence><sentence id="1171">When the Red Army neared our <span class="NPIP">places</span>, one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">companies</span> -- when the commander came, I was assigned at that time to be in the other staff.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And he came to telling the staff that the Red Army came and took away his men.</sentence><sentence id="1173">They need to refuse, where he in all kind of language stated to me, "Who is your commander?</sentence><sentence id="1174">Am I your commander?</sentence><sentence id="1175">Am I the staff, or the guy in the Red Army?What right did you have?"</sentence><sentence id="1176">And he used them -- all the language to them, "I don't care how you get your men back.</sentence><sentence id="1177">If they have to <span class="DLF">desert</span>, let them <span class="DLF">desert</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">I want you to go and get your men back."</sentence><sentence id="1179">To his dismay, he couldn't keep up -- find his men.</sentence><sentence id="1180">And this is a whole chaos at that time existed, and until we finally came out on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> after the 10 days" battle that had ensued around the Niemen until the Russians break through.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And after the encirclement, like I said, you see, we were asked to come <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1182">What the partisans at that particular time were asked to do was to keep going over on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and keep a vigil on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1183">At that particular time we weren't -- did not have yet the order.</sentence><sentence id="1184">As soon we found Germans hiding or anything and they surrendered, we didn't obey by the law.</sentence><sentence id="1185">We would take them out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and kill them.</sentence><sentence id="1186">Of course, and take the ammunition away from them.</sentence><sentence id="1187">So no sooner, a few days all of that went on, there was an order issued that the partisans are no longer to kill the Germans who are surrendering, because it's against the law.</sentence><sentence id="1188">It was bring them -- and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was started with POWs.</sentence><sentence id="1189">It was sort of a defeating purpose to us, that command, but we had to obey the order.</sentence><sentence id="1190">And immediately the Soviets started to -- at that particular time, they were probably in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front levels</span> maybe two, three days.</sentence><sentence id="1191">But they already had the administration mapped out to what <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> each <span class="BUILDING">building</span> would be located.</sentence><sentence id="1192">And before long, they started taking to service the local population.</sentence><sentence id="1193">The population was ordered that anybody between the ages of 21 to 55 is to register in an <span class="BUILDING">induction center</span> to go back into service.</sentence><sentence id="1194">The local population, which I'm speaking of at that place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>, were Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1195">That was not a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byelorussia</span>, that was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1196">And that's the last thing that was on their mind is to be going, riding out to be taken to go do soldiering for the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1197">The hate still was 0 imbedded in them, so it was embedded all the way, you couldn't help it.</sentence><sentence id="1198">So my new assignment was that I had to form a new platoon because a lot of them already went out in the open and got jobs as accountants or whatever it is in the civilian life, and they were discharged from this staff, which it was also in one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> inside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1199">For my luck, I did it.</sentence><sentence id="1200">Firstly, I had a big dilemma with myself.</sentence><sentence id="1201">I could not face the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">To me, the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was atrocious.</sentence><sentence id="1203">It was fearful.</sentence><sentence id="1204">And second of all, I was afraid once I go out, they're taking away my gun.</sentence><sentence id="1205">To me, the gun was my life; it was my protection.</sentence><sentence id="1206">It was everything I wanted, that's how I was.</sentence><sentence id="1207">So one of the guys would come to me that he was a .too.</sentence><sentence id="1208">He was an accountant by trade.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And he says, "Herr, what is the matter with you?"</sentence><sentence id="1210">It was hard for me to describe -- was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1211">He wrote a book in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1212">To the best of knowledge, it was never translated.</sentence><sentence id="1213">He wrote about me.</sentence><sentence id="1214">The book in Yiddish title is "The Participation of the Jews in the Soviet Underground."</sentence><sentence id="1215">And he generalized that in telling.</sentence><sentence id="1216">He didn't stop on particular issues, but he generalized it to tell about the whole scope and all the various partisans that existed and to prove the Jews were participating in it.</sentence><sentence id="1217">So he came out, it makes sense, he was an accountant.</sentence><sentence id="1218">He says, "Herr, I understand you're going to come out, too.</sentence><sentence id="1219">Why don't you go and get a <span class="BUILDING">job</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1220">I went to my commander at that particular time after that, and he says to me, "Where do you think I'm going to send you?</sentence><sentence id="1221">I'm going to send you to the militia to go for a job?</sentence><sentence id="1222">You stay here.</sentence><sentence id="1223">I'll tell you when you're going to be discharged."</sentence><sentence id="1224">And I remained there.</sentence><sentence id="1225">The next day we had a call from a colonel, a local colonel, who needed soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1226">He did not have enough of the regular army.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Whenever they didn't have enough soldiers, they turned to the partisans at this particular time to go ahead and supply.</sentence><sentence id="1228">So I got an order to send somebody for patrol to watch that colonel.</sentence><sentence id="1229">I literally sent them 10 men, and every man that I sent came back.</sentence><sentence id="1230">No, it was a general, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="1231">That the general would not accept them as to be.</sentence><sentence id="1232">And all they had to do is patrol the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1233">I became flabbergasted until I decided that I'm going to be the one and with the permission of my commander, he allowed me, that I'm going to go on duty and serve it.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I came in ina military form, saluted to him, told him my rank, what I am.</sentence><sentence id="1235">He was Jewish, a Semite.</sentence><sentence id="1236">And after, he says to me, "Sit down."</sentence><sentence id="1237">I sat down, and the biggest thing what had happened to me that I did not expect to hear a Soviet General to say shalom.</sentence><sentence id="1238">He said some Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1239">He says, "Who did you send me?</sentence><sentence id="1240">What kind of soldiers?"</sentence><sentence id="1241">I said, "They're not soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1242">They were partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1243">They were not trained soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1244">They were not inducted in the army."</sentence><sentence id="1245">And they were -- so they came and told him when they came on duty, he gave them up-and-down look. "</sentence><sentence id="1246">Hey, come on.</sentence><sentence id="1247">I don't need no farmer here."</sentence><sentence id="1248">So he says, "You see, you came like a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1249">You saluted, you told your rank.</sentence><sentence id="1250">I take you like a regular man in the army."</sentence><sentence id="1251">So I told him, "I'm the platoon commander.</sentence><sentence id="1252">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> is no longer because it was diversified to other things.</sentence><sentence id="1253">And since you rejected 10 men, I had no alternative, so with the permission of my commander, I came." "</sentence><sentence id="1254">Sit down, have a drink."</sentence><sentence id="1255">You know, Russian style.</sentence><sentence id="1256">You know, like tea in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1257">That's how Russians were, that you have a drink that you show your hospitality and you show your closeness.</sentence><sentence id="1258">I was afraid even to ask him too many questions, but since he himself used that word, "shalom," I took it for granted that he's open and he says, "Don't worry about it.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I'll get somebody else for patrol.</sentence><sentence id="1260">You're my concern."</sentence><sentence id="1261">Because it's the first time that I met somebody who wanted to hear what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1262">He didn't let me stay on duty, he asked me to stay there with him.</sentence><sentence id="1263">And I stayed there for two days, and afterwards, I was called because I was to take my platoon and join the <span class="BUILDING">induction center</span> 1 because we had to bring the inductees about 60, 70 miles away to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastyrok</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Because the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> were totally disrupted; the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> did not go any further than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastyrok</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1265">And so we mustered and within a few days a nice few thousand, maybe over 5, 6,000 and we put them in rows.</sentence><sentence id="1266">We had to march to get them out from the <span class="BUILDING">induction center</span> with bayonets.</sentence><sentence id="1267">And the women and children and everybody was like a demonstration.</sentence><sentence id="1268">They're crying over why their men are taken from them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1269">And some of them tried to pay off.</sentence><sentence id="1270">I knew from the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> that one of my platoon guys, because he later came and asked me.</sentence><sentence id="1271">And I told him that "If you talk to me again about bribe, I'm going to have you arrested."</sentence><sentence id="1272">So I don't want to hear about and I don't know -- so he understood that I don't want to be involved, but I wouldn't to hear.</sentence><sentence id="1273">He was a Jewish boy from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>, and I sort of see and don't see, you know, and don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1274">But whatever he wanted to do, he went.</sentence><sentence id="1275">And a lot of them what they did, they would write on a piece of paper that you have this list.</sentence><sentence id="1276">That period was mostly that you show up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>, they'll take him, but they wouldn't induct him again.</sentence><sentence id="1277">So what he did, in the meanwhile, they got someone that will give you watches; someone will give you gold pieces and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1278">I did not want to be a party to all of that, as I aforementioned.</sentence><sentence id="1279">We loaded them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and we went as far the old <span class="DLF">border</span> of the Soviet<span class="DLF">/Polish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1280">Over there, the military KGB took over and I was given papers to go back.</sentence><sentence id="1281">I would say this would finalize this part of the chapter, and after that we're going have to talk about the liberation and what had happened in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1415">Q: How much is left on this tape?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1417">Videographer: How much time we have.</sentence><sentence id="1418">25 minutes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: 25 minutes?</sentence><sentence id="1420">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1421">For me again, a human life had started with papers from the Soviet government written in it that every <span class="NPIP">place</span> I show up with my platoon, no matter how many I have, the head of this location of settlement is to provide me with my men, food, and shelter and a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1422">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> at that particular time were all the military.</sentence><sentence id="1423">It was a <span class="BUILDING">high court</span> to get you something, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1424">So we didn't care, whatever we could get on on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, for my whole platoon I remained with one Gentile boy.</sentence><sentence id="1425">Because I couldn't get hold him under any other circumstances, who was with me and I knew the farm place from where he came from that he had a mother and sister.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And many times in the partisan life before I joined the paratroopers, we would stop off to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1427">So he was the only one, Nathan, the guy that I told you was his name who was the bad guy who was taking bribes, he, of course, realized the way I am.</sentence><sentence id="1428">So he wanted to lose me faster than I could go, I had to be lost.</sentence><sentence id="1429">So we went in different directions, and we finally ended up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1430">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, if we get, we're going to work our way down further to go to his <span class="DLF">farm</span> or back to direction to see why we can wind up over there.</sentence><sentence id="1431">In the meanwhile while we are in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span>, I already in between time stopped off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> because I knew already that I was curious for me to see what's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1432">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> was already liberated months and months before.</sentence><sentence id="1433">And I found out through the partisans that our main staff that was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> no longer is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>, but it's right now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> located.</sentence><sentence id="1434">I went there to be registered and to get my validated things.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And I had to make another trip afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1436">The first thing I got up there was two medals that they gave 2 me.</sentence><sentence id="1437">One medal is for being a partisan, and the other medal was that I received at the time for being a heroic partisan.</sentence><sentence id="1438">So all of sudden, when I was on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Walodia (ph) together, I had the two medals.</sentence><sentence id="1439">He didn't get no medals or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1440">He only got the partisan validation, it looked like a medal that everyone was given in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1441">So when we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and that was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span>, within hours a guy comes over and I could recognize by his hat, that this color hats and so on belong to the NK VD, we used to call it at that time, which later turned to be KGB in due time later.</sentence><sentence id="1442">He got involved in conversation and he asked me for documents.</sentence><sentence id="1443">So I showed him the documents, firstly, these were given to me by the KGB when I was released from my platoon to go back.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And the other documents that I already had on me for the medals was that I was a partisan, and he found very interesting to ask me.</sentence><sentence id="1445">He says, "I want to stay with you.</sentence><sentence id="1446">You're going to fill me in and tell me what took place in the partisans."</sentence><sentence id="1447">Because to him was a total new story that he heard about it that Stalin used to rob and , but he never heard or known what activities and what had went on.</sentence><sentence id="1448">So "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="1449">he asked me.</sentence><sentence id="1450">And I tried to say here, Walodia (ph) here has a mother because he was from the and a sister, and I at the same time want to go back to that direction to see maybe somebody survived that I know from the partisans to me.</sentence><sentence id="1451">And then I'm going to go to look for <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1452">He says, "You don't have to look for work.</sentence><sentence id="1453">I'm going to take you to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1454">Then he told me that he's a lieutenant and probably going to get the rank of captain, and he's going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, which he will be inducting people for work in the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="1455">I realized that the KGB man will never say no more other things like that which at this particular time, I let him talk to me and I accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And we were friends on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, the whole period, too.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And that's how another phase of my life had started.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So that lieutenant did not let his eyes off of me and my partner, and we finally descended in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1459">And he made sure that I come with him and register in the <span class="BUILDING">employment agency</span> where he turned me into a captain in charge of that.</sentence><sentence id="1460">To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walodia</span>, my friend, he says, "The militia is right nearby.</sentence><sentence id="1461">Let him go back there, and he gave him his name if any

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1507">Q: When you use -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when you use the term, "militia," you're always referring to the local soldiers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1509">A: No, the local police.</sentence><sentence id="1510">In <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in the <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span>, there was no such thing as police.</sentence><sentence id="1511">It was always militia.</sentence><sentence id="1512">The militia was, you know what I mean, when we use saying the voluntary.</sentence><sentence id="1513">That was not voluntary, but that was a police force.</sentence><sentence id="1514">Take the police department in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I refer militia; that's what I mean.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1530">All right.</sentence><sentence id="1531">So Walodia registered there, and we made out with him that after registration we both want to take a two weeks" vacation, sort of to speak, so he can go to his 3 <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1532">Because actually it was harvest time at that time, we're talking about September at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1533">The biggest harvest time in that <span class="REGION">area</span> which his mother having a small <span class="DLF">farm</span>, would have needed a hand.</sentence><sentence id="1534">There wasn't enough.</sentence><sentence id="1535">So it was a good reason that they didn't mind that.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And they let me go with him because I was going as sort of a farm hand to help him on his <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1537">And at the same time, I just said I'll go.</sentence><sentence id="1538">So we got a date within two weeks to meet up back, I and the officer of the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="1539">And he and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the local police or militia, as they were called.</sentence><sentence id="1540">And while I went -- I already arrived now, they issued me new papers because in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> you did not travel anyplace without having the justified papers.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And the justified papers weren't meaning a permit.</sentence><sentence id="1542">You see, at a time later on we had to get passports because you always had to have your ID with you.</sentence><sentence id="1543">But at the time, they gave me and Walodia papers that we can go to the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1544">You had to specify where you're going, who you're going to see, what you're going do about it.</sentence><sentence id="1545">And papers in hand, we had already on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> free passage.</sentence><sentence id="1546">No nothing like this here to go back to his <span class="DLF">farm</span> in his little -- which it was located not to far from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1547">It was in a way sort of a happy journey for the first time for him.</sentence><sentence id="1548">The more I get freer and the more my eyes were seeing the free world, the more I became sort of shaken up.</sentence><sentence id="1549">I could not take freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1550">You did not have a psychiatrist at that time or a doctor to go to for help to help you overcome.</sentence><sentence id="1551">You just had to work it out.</sentence><sentence id="1552">When I came to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, his mother gave him a changeover and she gave me a changeover.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I was treated like part of the family, which at that particular time was again a novelty item for a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1554">A novelty item for survival from stuff like this here.</sentence><sentence id="1555">So we, of course, we had dinner and a few drinks, and afterwards, the two of us went out in the little -- it was a farm settlement, maybe I would say, maybe 60 to 80 families.</sentence><sentence id="1556">And they all had <span class="DLF">farms</span>, small <span class="DLF">farms</span>, around there, and there with a harmonica, you know what I mean, dancing and drinking, which it was all a celebration.</sentence><sentence id="1557">After all, they got a hero back, Walodia, which he grew up in this here.</sentence><sentence id="1558">And I, being the former commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walodia</span>, which I used to come as a partisan with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walodia</span> a lot of times, so I knew enough people in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> more than just his mother and so son.</sentence><sentence id="1559">We had another guy with us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1591">Q: I don't know what this noise is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1593">A: Some of these little things that I forgot myself to take and put it in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1594">Yes, there was also a few more guys who were in our brigade serving as partisans from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1595">And the other ones were inducted, while they would not be the paratroopers like we were.</sentence><sentence id="1596">Let's see, I was where?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1597">A: You were talking about you were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> and everyone was happy to see <span class="BUILDING">Walodia home</span> and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1599">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walodia</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1600">So I said for this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> they saw two heroes, Walodia and me.</sentence><sentence id="1601">And the greetings they gave me almost made a change in my heart and soul of thinking the way my future is to go.</sentence><sentence id="1602">I went down so low as to say to myself I'm going to <span class="DLF">farm</span> with Walodia and I'm going to forget any longer that I'm a Jew or was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1603">Because the greeting, the way I was received for the days ensuing, and that always went on a week's time.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Each morning I would go ahead with Walodia on his <span class="REGION">land</span> and it was harvest time, get involved with the 4 same thing he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="1605">At night we would go out together like Russian style to have some drinking.</sentence><sentence id="1606">And I figured, hey, what the heck, that's the life to live.</sentence><sentence id="1607">I'll go back to all that sorrow, I thought maybe that's an escape for me.</sentence><sentence id="1608">Then comes Friday, Walodia says to me, "Harold, aren't you going to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span> to see your Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1609">And that struck me quick like a lightening went through my body, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1610">I says what am I thinking about going to become a non-Jew, and I immediately began to think you can run, but you cannot hide.</sentence><sentence id="1611">And his words to me about -- he didn't say, "Harold, how about going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and to see our partisans," because the Jews that he was making reference to were not survivors, they were partisans but they were in other companies or groups likely.</sentence><sentence id="1612">But they were basically with us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">That issue for him saying Jews instead of partisans, it's like gave me a tremor in my body that no, that was not the way to think the way I was thinking those few days.</sentence><sentence id="1614">I'm going to probably become a Gentile and get married and forget about all that.</sentence><sentence id="1615">I said to him, "Oh, yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walodia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1616">I was thinking to tell you about it, but I did not have the nerve of disrupting all that work that you have on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1617">But, please, whenever time will permit you, I would want to go in to visit."</sentence><sentence id="1618">And not using that word, "Jews," with out partisan friends, and not using it in singular, but using much rather plural.</sentence><sentence id="1619">However, I says, "Let us cross near the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span> because I will ask sort of for you to make a stop there."</sentence><sentence id="1620">Because in that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> I had both my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="1621">They still died before, no matter what the tribulations were as I was talking about, so they still were brought to burial there.</sentence><sentence id="1622">My father also was buried there.</sentence><sentence id="1623">So I sort of, like I say, was all of a sudden another person again.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And as we came to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, needless to say, that I could never see the headstones that were put because the headstones were desecrated by the <span class="REGION">local area</span> during that year, which they were made to <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="1625">So my trip was not fully in vain because at least I saw that not only were the local, the living destroyed and harassed, but even the dead did not have their peace to remain in peace in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were placed there.</sentence><sentence id="1626">I did my share of crying, and all of a sudden, I was not a hero.</sentence><sentence id="1627">The killer, the partisan that I was, I became the Jew again.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Time was not running fast enough for me to come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span>, so I could meet up with some of my former mates that I was together in the group or being in the other group.</sentence><sentence id="1629">And I found the girls that I remembered that had rode with us, so they sort of cling together.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Nobody returned back into their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, but much rather in one's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the girls were staying.</sentence><sentence id="1631">So they were in one <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the three girls were staying together.</sentence><sentence id="1632">One of the girls that I remembered when I was with , we sort of shared backs because sleeping at night and her husband was the bosky, which I mentioned who had run away at that time from our <span class="REGION">areas</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianske</span>, she was there.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And then I saw, I met two more, and, of course, they were very happy at, you know what I mean, that I did come.</sentence><sentence id="1634">Basically, there were more girls by comparison to say a lot, than the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And then I went to meet up with the Dalchovitz (ph) family, and at the time I already heard that three girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span> and they situated themselves with

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1673">They did not want to remain in a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.392306" long="14.327071">Briesen</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1674">Be that it was some fear, that's why they cling.</sentence><sentence id="1675">The man would stay in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> even if it was their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, former <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I mean, or someone else's.</sentence><sentence id="1676">But it wasn't like somebody moved in especially like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalchovitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1677">At that particular time, there were three brothers.</sentence><sentence id="1678">So it's understanding that they were in their former <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that they reclaimed.</sentence><sentence id="1679">But the girls, I found that three of those living ones were left and they could have, in other words, moved in back to theirs.</sentence><sentence id="1680">But they stayed 5 in the one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And we did not hear of any bad feelings about it for the returning partisans when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1682">A lot of them reclaimed their <span class="BUILDING">properties</span> without even going through the legal process.</sentence><sentence id="1683">Be that the Gentiles were fearful of invoking the law on them will hurt their future, or they did it as a gesture of their own, I would not be able to at this time to place judgment to tell you one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="1684">Because either way or both of things would have been accurate and assumption.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And I told them that I have undertaken a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, and I will look up our girls over there, the three of them, since I know now that they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, near.</sentence><sentence id="1686">So my stay over there was burning under my feet.</sentence><sentence id="1687">That whole epithet with Walodia bringing me back out of sort of, I don't want to use that word, that was a dream.</sentence><sentence id="1688">Because if it was a dream, I must have to call it a bad dream.</sentence><sentence id="1689">Or facing again the places of murder.</sentence><sentence id="1690">Seeing in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that for that short little time the partisans were there, they built a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="1691">Painted up in white, and sort of put on an insignia to say that here are buried all those killed in the massacre of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1692">You know, without knowing the amount or whatever it is and that sort of remained like a monument place that I believe I last heard of that it was a little bit improvement, more sign for that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1693">Because as I stated it before in my recordings to say they were afraid to take them out to the big <span class="DLF">pits</span> that the Russian making because of the fear of the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1694">So we saw that the <span class="DLF">pits</span> filled up with lime on the top, that we whatever we are could find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1695">But the difference was now that I saw friends and I saw a sign telling who is buried underneath there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1719">Q: You didn't have any family or...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1721">A: Of course, my brothers, my sister, my uncles, my aunts.</sentence><sentence id="1722">I had quite a big family which I don't till this day were they killed and burned inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or were they brought out and killed in these <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which they were led from the bombings when the war had started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1725">Q: No one left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1727">A: No, no one survived it.</sentence><sentence id="1728">I had my uncle which I mentioned who in my <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> came, and he survived them and he came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1729">He told me that my brother started to fight the police back and they didn't shoot him, but they beat him to death on the outside of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1730">So that's what I was told by him.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And what had happened the fate of where they were buried?</sentence><sentence id="1732">My uncle and my rest of the brothers and sisters, I did not know.</sentence><sentence id="1733">So perhaps maybe this is the bitterness in me over why I never cared to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.529972" long="21.639361">Debrecen</span> to face the evil.</sentence><sentence id="1734">To see the injustices the way people and that era, and with no one to turn to to their help or to their safety.</sentence><sentence id="1735">So I cut shorter even the time and then I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1736">When I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.133" long="26.017">Baranovichi</span>, I looked up those three girls.</sentence><sentence id="1737">Russa (ph) was the one you recollect in my conversation telling that she was the one taking care of that fiihrer.</sentence><sentence id="1738">And it was another girl, there was another girl who her boyfriend that she was dating at the time met the last few days of liberation to them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, he met his death at that time while on a mission fighting there.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And I, of course -- she was his girlfriend, and so she was in <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and then was one more, Sonja, which she's in the <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1740">As a matter of fact, she 6 lives in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">condos</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca</span>, which I've seen.</sentence><sentence id="1741">But she was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="1742">So those three girls housed themselves together, and often they told me that they used to get Jewish guys as pilots or so coming to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1743">So all of a sudden, I was invited by them sort of to become a frequent visitor whenever I have time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1744">Which when time permitted me, I was.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Now, I must step over to tell you another epithet which it happened while being in the NK VD.</sentence><sentence id="1746">The NK VD work, which it may sound odd in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> that it went on, really I had one payroll check, but I was doing the work of four.</sentence><sentence id="1747">I was a secretarial job.</sentence><sentence id="1748">I was the man in charge of the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">auto</span> -- in other words, they had so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">autos</span> in the department, I was the one issuing for them gasoline tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1749">I was the one doing the accounting of consumption of all of that.</sentence><sentence id="1750">And I also was the one responsible with another job that once a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Minsk car</span> would go to bring all kinds of stuff, be uniforms or whatever the department needed, which it was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1751">They kept it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byelorussia</span>, so as I say -- and before the holidays so any roundups, I had to go duty as a KGB which I was assigned with maybe two more guys and go to the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1752">As the time of year it is, as I say, the war was not over in total as yet, because the war went on until about May the 7th or the 8th when it was declared the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="1753">So every time before a holiday was nearing, we used to have to go to search <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and search passports and different documents.</sentence><sentence id="1754">Because we were told there are crime going on, and there are many people who resist the Soviet system because we used to give our political speeches.</sentence><sentence id="1755">And it's our job to go and turn all of these here criminals in.</sentence><sentence id="1756">On one of these here journeys, one day it happened I was again the head of the group, there were three of us.</sentence><sentence id="1757">I knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and then I'm jumping the gun because that happened already when I was married.</sentence><sentence id="1758">I got married in January of 1945, and, you know, we are quite a bit off yet.</sentence><sentence id="1759">We are still talking about September, you know, August, September, nearing

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1793">Q: Let's just stick with the...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1795">A: So with that mission at that particular time, we were assigned to look for criminals.</sentence><sentence id="1796">What was the criminal?</sentence><sentence id="1797">Somebody who did not report to be inducted.</sentence><sentence id="1798">That was a criminal.</sentence><sentence id="1799">Everybody in their passport had to have a separate page stamped from the <span class="BUILDING">induction center</span> that he's released from induction because maybe he was not fit medically -- I mean, physically.</sentence><sentence id="1800">Maybe he wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="1801">There were other deficiencies, but on the passport if you did not have that stamp or that page proving to you that you were released from service becoming a soldier in other words, being inducted, you had to turn them in.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And believe me a lot of times maybe the people have fear, did not have the documents with them, and we used to round up so much time.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And then if they were questioned, they didn't find anything to hold them, they would let them out.</sentence><sentence id="1804">Now, that particular night I'm knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I was first to knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And I keep telling them, I said, "Make the lights.</sentence><sentence id="1806">This is the KGB coming for an inspection.</sentence><sentence id="1807">Everybody come out holding their passports ready for examination."</sentence><sentence id="1808">In it comes out a voice in Yiddish with Hebrew stating say, " which translating that into English means Hebrew or Jew, keep on walking.</sentence><sentence id="1809">It sounds so strange in a way and it got me in a very peculiar way.</sentence><sentence id="1810">I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, closed the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I said -- the others say, "Something going on?"</sentence><sentence id="1811">I says, "Everything is in order.</sentence><sentence id="1812">Everything is fine.</sentence><sentence id="1813">Let us proceed to the next <span class="NPIP">mission</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1814">He left me, however, with a feeling, I feel like I 7 must go back to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1815">Find out who was that guy who was talking.</sentence><sentence id="1816">You know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="1817">So sure enough, the next day in the middle of the day I'm coming there in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1818">I knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I met him in there.</sentence><sentence id="1819">I says, "I was the guy last night.</sentence><sentence id="1820">Who was the one who said," "?</sentence><sentence id="1821">And he said he don't want to commit himself until -- which by coincidence of how it would be, that was a cousin.</sentence><sentence id="1822">A first cousin to my wife who was also a partisan at .</sentence><sentence id="1823">And he was trying to beat, because the war was coming over, who wanted to be inducted?</sentence><sentence id="1824">And after a while surviving a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, surviving a partisan, and right now he had to go back to fight?</sentence><sentence id="1825">Besides the man was older, but he was still leading the criterion of age, and he could not have any other way of saving himself from not going.</sentence><sentence id="1826">So they were really hiding out sort of waiting all of the days until it will come to an end and the induction probably won't be here.</sentence><sentence id="1827">Which I had to tell him, we got to talk word for word he was with the , and word for word we got to talk about who I know and what, where and when.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And I tried to tell him, give him my wife's name.</sentence><sentence id="1829">He says, "You know, that's my first cousin."</sentence><sentence id="1830">So it was such a coincidence, we're thrown again in a funny kind of situation.</sentence><sentence id="1831">I tried to tell, I says, "I'm working the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="1832">I hope you understand.</sentence><sentence id="1833">We met now, but I cannot give my head for you guys" hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1834">At this moment, you better do what you want to do.</sentence><sentence id="1835">I don't want to find you again when I come here.</sentence><sentence id="1836">I really cannot protect you, so you got to do what you got to do."</sentence><sentence id="1837">Which they moved away back, you know what I mean, someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="1838">And, you know, it so happens neither one of them was inducted.</sentence><sentence id="1839">They got themselves secure jobs that they shouldn't be able to be inducted.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And that was another little story to tell what had happened over there.</sentence><sentence id="1841">The next thing what had happened to me over there that every time the captain would see me from the employment, he would turn around and say to me, "You know, you need to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because on your post that you have, you can only -- must be at least a first lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="1842">You have no rank.</sentence><sentence id="1843">We keep you here because we don't have any men, and besides you deserve it.</sentence><sentence id="1844">You were in the partisans," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1845">So I says, "Where is that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at?"</sentence><sentence id="1846">And he would tell me the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1847">In my mind I did not have the love for the Soviet system even then in my mind, and it was sort of a secretive part in me because you could not talk or disclose.</sentence><sentence id="1848">In other words, I didn't ask to go to work to the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="1849">I was sort of forced into it in a way.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And I started to tell him that at the moment I wish I could get just a little bit more time to get the past out of my system.</sentence><sentence id="1851">I mean, you know, the war is about -- not over yet, and I will take it under consideration.</sentence><sentence id="1852">Because over there they tell you to do, but it's got to come in a form that you ask for it.</sentence><sentence id="1853">That I will find in the proper time the papers to be sent to a special school of officers to be able to further my career.</sentence><sentence id="1854">At the same time to get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1855">Many nights I would sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because as much as the man responsible for finding <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and the housing man with a family they implanted somebody.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And they used to say find <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for Harold or Joe, or whatever it is and that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1857">For families, it was almost impossible because a lot of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were burned, you know, and destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And here there was influx of so many more Soviets coming in because to take over the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and make it under their control.</sentence><sentence id="1859">So it was -- I got in a very bad mood, and one day I come into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1860">And I say to my captain there, which he was the boss of the employment, I says, "I decided that I want to join the service."</sentence><sentence id="1861">He says, "Wait a minute, you little so-and-so.</sentence><sentence id="1862">Do you know where you're at?</sentence><sentence id="1863">Have you forgotten that you're working for the KGB?</sentence><sentence id="1864">In the KGB, you're not coming to tell me what you are going to do, what you 8 intend to do.</sentence><sentence id="1865">We are going to tell you what to do, when to do it."</sentence><sentence id="1866">He says, "I will tell you whether you can go and register as a volunteer to go to the army.</sentence><sentence id="1867">Besides, we are ona special statute.</sentence><sentence id="1868">You cannot be drafted without us from the KGB allowing you to serve.</sentence><sentence id="1869">And you cannot serve in the KGB of the military.</sentence><sentence id="1870">You haven't got the education and you haven't got the rank.</sentence><sentence id="1871">So, therefore, get it out of your head and don't you dare ever come to ask me things like that on your own."</sentence><sentence id="1872">It fell not on deaf ears, but very open ears.</sentence><sentence id="1873">I began to feel more scared than I felt secure before.</sentence><sentence id="1874">I had a problem at that particular time, as I said, with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1875">And with food, I did not have so much a problem because I was eating in the <span class="BUILDING">officers" restaurant</span>, and at <span class="BUILDING">officers" restaurant</span> the food was much better.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I had a guy, Captain Trusoff (ph), who was in charge of financial department, and he would give me extra coupons because we wore Russian cards at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1877">But in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for the officers, you could eat what you want and as much as you want, but had to have that card.</sentence><sentence id="1878">So whenever I wanted to have more than one meal I would go to Captain Trusoff (ph), and I was a young man and I was a hungry person at the time for years when I was coming back to myself.</sentence><sentence id="1879">So he would see to it that if I need something, Captain Trusoff (ph) would be at my side.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Before long behind that announcements that all the people who came from the formerly <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and wish to return back can right now come and register at the Polish Soviet Commission and, you know, the hours and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1881">Naively, I think nothing of it.</sentence><sentence id="1882">I forget myself again and the words that he said about the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="1883">I go ahead and register myself the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I was born.</sentence><sentence id="1884">They knew that I was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, you know, that it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And I tell them when I register that I'm willing for a settlement to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, not thinking for one moment that everything from that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> is going to come immediately to the KGB and they will immediately know that I went again to do something without permission, especially not an assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And that's this thing what had happened the following the day when I came to work -- do we have enough time?</sentence><sentence id="1887">When I came to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, my <span class="DLF">door</span> was locked.</sentence><sentence id="1888">My boss locked the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1889">The other secretary was not let in to come in, and he asked me to face him to sit down at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1890">And he started a full investigation about Harold.</sentence><sentence id="1891">State your name.</sentence><sentence id="1892">State your address.</sentence><sentence id="1893">State your age.</sentence><sentence id="1894">Where were you born, and tell him all about myself like my history and the way I was in the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And I was a platoon commander, and all of this here.</sentence><sentence id="1896">And then he turns around, as if he wouldn't know, "Tell me, I see you're wearing two medals.</sentence><sentence id="1897">Would you explain me what these medals is?"</sentence><sentence id="1898">I say to him, "But I already told you before when I was hired here on the job what these medals are.</sentence><sentence id="1899">What do you want ask me?"</sentence><sentence id="1900">In the meanwhile, tantrum is setting in on me.</sentence><sentence id="1901">But he bangs his hand on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and he says, "I already told you many times when I ask a question, you are to answer now when J ask you, and not to tell me that you already.</sentence><sentence id="1902">When I ask you any question, you must answer it to me."</sentence><sentence id="1903">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1904">So I tell him what these here two medals stand for.</sentence><sentence id="1905">I already -- as I said which I will tell in another <span class="NPIP">part</span>, the way I got married and what had happened, was wearing a ring that my father-in-law bought me at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1906">He says, "What is that ring which you're wearing?</sentence><sentence id="1907">Don't you know that that's a showing of bourgeois?"</sentence><sentence id="1908">In other words, in our system, people do not wear rings because I answered him that it's a ring that I got from my father-in-law as a gift from getting married.</sentence><sentence id="1909">Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2029">A: We still are talking about right now that I registered, heard about registration to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, if you remember.</sentence><sentence id="2030">And I said I'm right now with the boss in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> with a locked <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2031">And he's asking me all sorts of questions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2035">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2036">Let's pick up here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2039">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2040">Ready?</sentence><sentence id="2041">The questions ensued until about lunch hour.</sentence><sentence id="2042">The lunch hour we started at 1 o'clock at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2043">The boss called a halt and we're going for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="2044">Since I was eligible and used to go to the same <span class="BUILDING">officers" restaurant</span> as him, he told me they're going to stop right now and go for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="2045">To my surprise when I came out to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, so many officers, all of sudden, like the news spread out.</sentence><sentence id="2046">Everybody all of a sudden found out that Harold registered to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and everybody knows, but Harold didn't know about it, see?</sentence><sentence id="2047">And here I'm put to a dilemma, some officers be that they served in the police, be that they worked in the KGB with me, taking it for a total shock as if to say how dare you do a thing like that?</sentence><sentence id="2048">You brought shame on us.</sentence><sentence id="2049">Here, look at him.</sentence><sentence id="2050">He is a -- look at him, he is a second lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="2051">Look at the other one in all kinds of ranks.</sentence><sentence id="2052">You're living here in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where the Jews have all the privileges and all the rights, and you are trying to away?</sentence><sentence id="2053">I says, "What do you mean, trying to go away?</sentence><sentence id="2054">It was published for anybody who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who can return back." "</sentence><sentence id="2055">Why do you want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2056">I said, "<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is the same.</sentence><sentence id="2057">We are in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as it's here.</sentence><sentence id="2058">Maybe by hook or by crook, I can look up some of my families or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="2059">| am not escaping, or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2060">I would like to go ahead to see that." "</sentence><sentence id="2061">No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="2062"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is anti-Semitic, and you have no rights and business to go back."</sentence><sentence id="2063">I says - - so he says to me, "I want you -- I cannot order you -- that you must go back and withdraw your registration.</sentence><sentence id="2064">All of us officers here, you're loved by us all.</sentence><sentence id="2065">We like you, you must return our rights to us now because you brought shame on us.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And you must be erasing that.</sentence><sentence id="2067">So the only way for you to do it is you must go back and resign."</sentence><sentence id="2068">There at lunch I meet up also with Captain Trusoff, who I said was the head of the finance department, and he was a very fast- talking guy, a man who could talk so fast that you could hardly hear him as fast as he was saying.</sentence><sentence id="2069">But he was a tremendous able man in the area of financing and accounting and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2070">And often would like to talk with me and train me in that endeavor, which it meant more work for me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2071">And he says, "Harold, what are you trying to do?"</sentence><sentence id="2072">Here, a captain in the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="2073">I tell him the story.</sentence><sentence id="2074">He said, "Don't tell me none of which you're trying to tell the others.</sentence><sentence id="2075">You don't like it here.</sentence><sentence id="2076">You want to run away from here because you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2077">You still like the story of commerce and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2078">So I don't want to buy anything of this here."</sentence><sentence id="2079">Listening to him, and he was like my right hand supplying with food and so on, I was sort of under his guard.</sentence><sentence id="2080">I cannot afford him not to turn against me.</sentence><sentence id="2081">I said, "Captain Trusoff, would you please tell me what you would like for me to do?</sentence><sentence id="2082">I will listen."</sentence><sentence id="2083">He says, "Good.</sentence><sentence id="2084">You go and ask permission from your boss, and you go back to the commission over there and make an official resignation.</sentence><sentence id="2085">And everything will be fine, stay like this here."</sentence><sentence id="2086">I says, "I'm going to ask my boss and I will do it.</sentence><sentence id="2087">And thank you for advising 1 me.</sentence><sentence id="2088">I'm sorry I caused all of that to you."</sentence><sentence id="2089">I apologized to all of them, and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2090">We went to eat.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Coming back, my boss started with the questions.</sentence><sentence id="2092">I told him, I says, "Please forgive me.</sentence><sentence id="2093">I would like to ask a favor of you."</sentence><sentence id="2094">He says, "What is it?"</sentence><sentence id="2095">I says, "I realized after talking to Captain Trusoff and naming my name all the other officers, that I made a grave mistake.</sentence><sentence id="2096">I did not make that mistake maliciously or knowingly.</sentence><sentence id="2097">I made that mistake for not thinking about what I was doing, so I beg your pardon of forgiveness.</sentence><sentence id="2098">And I want to get time so I can go to the commission and register -- and in other words, resign officially on the document.</sentence><sentence id="2099">Would you tell me that I can do it?"</sentence><sentence id="2100">He says, "Tomorrow, you can do it in the regular hours of lunch.</sentence><sentence id="2101">You can go there and resign."</sentence><sentence id="2102">And he began to continue still with his questioning and he said that's the good thing that what I did now, and he appreciates it very much that I'm restoring my dignity of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, the job over here.</sentence><sentence id="2103">And he knows that that is not going to hurt my qualifications of whatever it is further to be done.</sentence><sentence id="2104">And I was turning back to my work, the secretary came back in, and I thought maybe that it's all over.</sentence><sentence id="2105">Two hours later, I was called into another <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and again, the same thing started again.</sentence><sentence id="2106">What it meant is now, they were trying to compare notes as to what I was asked earlier, am I going to be repeating again.</sentence><sentence id="2107">I became so annoyed with it and so scared that I ran up a fever.</sentence><sentence id="2108">We used to have a big break of the hours between 6:00 and 8:00 for two hours.</sentence><sentence id="2109">Which it was like dinnertime.</sentence><sentence id="2110">I told the officer that I'm in charge that I am -- I feel like I have a fever, and I don't think I'll be able to walk <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2111">I need the help of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> -- I mean, I said <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2112">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>, we did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="2113">So I was given a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to be taken <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2114">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I took a thermometer and equal to the temperature as we would have, I almost had a 101 and 1/2.</sentence><sentence id="2115">And I was shivering when I came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I was living in it, where also former partisans and some of them came back.</sentence><sentence id="2116">So I tried to tell them the story, what had ensued with me, what it's all about, and that I have a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2117">How can I relay that message to my wife, which she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shevchenko</span> or or Chita or it's any of the three names that it's been called, all three, to tell her what had transpired over here?</sentence><sentence id="2118">And when time came for me to come back to work, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2119">And all of sudden, I hear the roar of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2120">And in those days when you heard a roar from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, it could have been only from the police of the KGB because civilian people did not driving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2121">And when I look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>, I saw the Commandant himself came in and walked in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2122">He came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, asked me, "How come you're not at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2123">I tell him, I says, "I developed a temperature, that's how I was taken.</sentence><sentence id="2124">I couldn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2125">And I show him the temperature.</sentence><sentence id="2126">He says, "I have an order to bring you back, so I don't want to hear any of your excuses, temperature, whatever it is."</sentence><sentence id="2127">Well, the women over there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, "Harold, take off your ring."</sentence><sentence id="2128">I was having a watch.</sentence><sentence id="2129">"Take off the watch."</sentence><sentence id="2130">I was under the pretension that I'm taken in to be arrested, no other way.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And I'm leaving them a message, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2132">One woman is offering me to take a sandwich with me, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2133">I say, "I'm not hungry."</sentence><sentence id="2134">Who could eat at a time like that?</sentence><sentence id="2135">And I came, was brought back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that I worked from.</sentence><sentence id="2136">I'm sitting there for a half-hour and almost like malaria got on me.</sentence><sentence id="2137">I was shivering.</sentence><sentence id="2138">And I could see the boss, the captain is not in.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And like I expressed so many times before, I was in that time a rebel.</sentence><sentence id="2140">I picked up the phone and called the general.</sentence><sentence id="2141">The general was the head of the whole regional KGB.</sentence><sentence id="2142">He was a hero from the war missing one hand, which he had lost in battle.</sentence><sentence id="2143">And that's what had helped him regain to have that rank what he got over there.</sentence><sentence id="2144">And at times each one of us had assignments to be on guard duty for 24 hours in the main <span class="BUILDING">office 2</span> into various assignments.</sentence><sentence id="2145">Some of them were encoding and decoding and some of them were just answering the phone and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>

came, it's tonight."</sentence><sentence id="2680">So the first thing she went running to find her father.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2681">Her father then was playing cards in another <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he came in.</sentence><sentence id="2682">And, of course, it was a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2683">He wouldn't permit me to go sleep with her, obviously, to say.</sentence><sentence id="2684">So we decided tomorrow, the following day, Tuesday, that we are going to go into -- it was called Zachs (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2685"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zachs</span> was the marriage license department officially in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, so we went to make that official.</sentence><sentence id="2686">No sooner we got registered there and everything like that, I got a note to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2687">Because the guys that were former partisans were working in the KGB here and with the police also the same way.</sentence><sentence id="2688">So they came quickly to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to tell me that they are not going to arrest me, but I have a warranty for my arrest and now that I came to the officialdom -- everything was tied into the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="2689">If you got married, the KGB got some of the knowledge about it, too, because that's how they controlled the population.</sentence><sentence id="2690">I being aware or not aware, I did it and I didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="2691">I was the rebel at the time that I didn't care what's going tomorrow or the next hour.</sentence><sentence id="2692">So they said to me, "Harold, when do you decide to go back?"</sentence><sentence id="2693">I says, "I plan on going back Thursday, no later."</sentence><sentence id="2694">They say, "Okay, we'll cover you till Thursday, but Thursday you better get your fanny out of here because otherwise we got to arrest you."</sentence><sentence id="2695">Of course, it looks like the KGB was notified officially after that where I am and that I'm on my way back and I'll be there.</sentence><sentence id="2696">And my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, gave me Vodka to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he used to do <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> dealing.</sentence><sentence id="2697">He used to make the uppers for boots, and boots in those days was like a jeweler, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2698">Everybody liked to have a pair of boots, and that gave him enough from the farmers who from making boots, that will would bring him all kinds of food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so it was no shortage.</sentence><sentence id="2699">And before long he used to go into <span class="BUILDING">black marketeer</span> to get the other materials, leather and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2700">He would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span> for the raw materials.</sentence><sentence id="2701">So she got him, and we already were married officially sort of the next morning because it was, and for that night we planned on a Tuesday night to plan to have an official Jewish ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="2702">So we got a hold the acting sort of rabbi, who was also a man who was in the partisans, but he was a blacksmith.</sentence><sentence id="2703">And through history we know there were blacksmith rabbis in the times of the sages, so it was a 8 .</sentence><sentence id="2704">However, it came to write exuba (ph), meaning the marital contract, he tells me he does not know how.</sentence><sentence id="2705">I says, "I do know how, but, you know, I was a student of that.</sentence><sentence id="2706">But it's illegitimate, you cannot write your own contract.</sentence><sentence id="2707">It must be fulfilled by somebody else."</sentence><sentence id="2708">So we decided just in his presence and the presence of witnesses to give hands and it became sort of a married officialdom with all the other things, but without getting that official document, exuba (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2709">But officially we went through the whole -- and the guys were there, the former partisans, we had a house party to celebrate our wedding.</sentence><sentence id="2710">But it was officially as it could be.</sentence><sentence id="2711">Legally and officially, although not for the Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2712">So that's when we got married, and I came back.</sentence><sentence id="2713">For greetings when I came in, I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2714">I was asked to surrender my gun immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2715">The Commandant took me under arrest and charged me with desertion.</sentence><sentence id="2716">The thing, he put me into the <span class="BUILDING">jailhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2717">A few hours later, after two hours, no one other than the general himself is coming down.</sentence><sentence id="2718">And he says to him to the Commandant, "Why did you arrest him?"</sentence><sentence id="2719">So he said he did, he had the order for desertion, so he turned around to me. "</sentence><sentence id="2720">Would you please tell me what has transpired?"</sentence><sentence id="2721">I tell him, I says, "Three times I made applications filed through my boss that he knows for giving me permission to go and get married."</sentence><sentence id="2722">I says, "I thought getting married is constitutional.</sentence><sentence id="2723">However, I needed to do it in writing.</sentence><sentence id="2724">I did, I lived up to it and three times I was turned down.</sentence><sentence id="2725">So I got tired."</sentence><sentence id="2726">He says, "I got to put boss in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2727">He says, "Get him out."</sentence><sentence id="2728">He says, "Not you."</sentence><sentence id="2729">I thanked him, and afterwards I said to the Commandant, "You see, I brought you salami and Vodka," and we turned it into sort of a festive mood.</sentence><sentence id="2730">And I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to continue my work, and no charges whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2731">But at the same time I was fearful, so I left words with my father- in-law and discussed the issue of escape with him.</sentence><sentence id="2732">And I said to him, "Let's wait over a week or two.</sentence><sentence id="2733">And please go ahead under this and this name."</sentence><sentence id="2734">As I said at the outset of my recording that my birth name was Zuckerman.</sentence><sentence id="2735">I changed Zuckerman to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zissman</span>; that's when the changing took place.</sentence><sentence id="2736">I registered because as Zissman, there was no one they can trace it to.</sentence><sentence id="2737">So I didn't care how long it will take them to find out who that Zissman is.</sentence><sentence id="2738">Rather that is the KGB problem, but I told them they send in my brother-in-law -- my present brother-in- law, he went in sort of to be the person and they knew him.</sentence><sentence id="2739">You know, in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> they knew each other, and my new name became -- as far as the Polish government was concerned, was Zissman and it was all changed.</sentence><sentence id="2740">And I was awaiting when the papers will be ready for them to let me know and I'll make the escape.</sentence><sentence id="2741">However, deep in me -- and I was called now to go ahead for duty at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the general.</sentence><sentence id="2742">I was afraid that somebody's not playing and I said to my boss, I said, "Why are you sending me after all I committed?"</sentence><sentence id="2743">He says, "You were told already too many times.</sentence><sentence id="2744">When something's wrong, we'll tell you.</sentence><sentence id="2745">You have no reason for me to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="2746">You asked to go for duty;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2933">A: Now, we are talking about early May, not early the Ist or the 2nd, but it was in May of 19 -- it had to be about -- to finish what I'm going to say -- had to be about May the 11th or 10th.</sentence><sentence id="2934">Something like here, of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2935">So we came there and take a look in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2936">I found from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> a guy who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="2937">We used to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when we first moved to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, that was our first <span

id="2942">He says please don't do that because one of the guys which he told me, which was also a guy of our age, who lived through in hiding, the first day he came back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span>, he was shot dead and killed.</sentence><sentence id="2943">Well, they didn't -- seeing us come back meant one thing, which I gave you to read about, the article.</sentence><sentence id="2944">It meant one thing, returning the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> or returning the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2945">It was confiscated by their volition from the Germans and the Polish government, which it was established right after the war came to an end in that part which the Soviets liberated, they did not look into it about the Poles should return with a public property, of their own property, which it was unofficially taken by them.</sentence><sentence id="2946">So they didn't want to give it up, so it was easier to kill the Jews who claimed that instead of giving up theirs.</sentence><sentence id="2947">I understand as of

time because the public was in need of means.</sentence><sentence id="2961">And the governments were not ready and able to help them restore.</sentence><sentence id="2962">So they were happy that no

class="BUILDING">organizations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3380">When it becomes government organizations, it takes some of the normal ways -- it will never go, but that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="3381">In that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, I met up one guy who was with us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3382">He was with Captain Davidoff (ph), if you heard me mention with the easterners, that he was serving there with him.</sentence><sentence id="3383">And his wife and my wife and I, we knew them personally well, and somehow or other, we had our group of guys which it was partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3384">We had some from our <span class="REGION">area</span>, some other partisans were from an <span class="REGION">area</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valin</span> (ph), which is the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> which again was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before 1939.</sentence><sentence id="3385">And we sort of everybody was linking with his own, sort of.</sentence><sentence id="3386">And immediately we were taking sort of charge as the partisans" area.</sentence><sentence id="3387">Hey, you need muscle guys?</sentence><sentence id="3388">We are here and we are available and we have the means to do it and carry it out.</sentence><sentence id="3389">So before long while we are going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span>, yeah from then Grozny in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, we were told nothing when you're leaving the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> what -- nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3390">What saw day by day that certain faces are no longer around.</sentence><sentence id="3391">So I come over to this guy, I'll refer to him as Lusik (ph), that was his name.</sentence><sentence id="3392">And I find out immediately, he tells me that he is a guide.</sentence><sentence id="3393">He guides people how to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3394">The aim of it, I to find out, is to cross over to the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, and this was still have to be so quietly done because it was still the Soviet zone 8 occupied in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in this part.</sentence><sentence id="3395">Although later on, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span> becomes, the Soviets retreat until they readjusted the <span class="DLF">borders</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3396">So he told me he's a guide.</sentence><sentence id="3397">I says, "Hey, can you do anything for us?</sentence><sentence id="3398">When are we going to leave?</sentence><sentence id="3399">How long are we going to stay here?"</sentence><sentence id="3400">And he said, "Don't tush.</sentence><sentence id="3401">Nobody's going to remain.</sentence><sentence id="3402">Everybody's going to sent out."</sentence><sentence id="3403">And it sort of was very strange, but, you know, you put two and two together you get to understand.</sentence><sentence id="3404">The guys with money paid off and they were -- so he was telling me he was taken through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elk Mountains</span> to cross over.</sentence><sentence id="3405">All of a sudden, I was summoned in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to come in.</sentence><sentence id="3406">They say, "Harold, tomorrow 12 guys, all of the partisans male and female, you're going to get a direction where to go.</sentence><sentence id="3407">You're going to go across."</sentence><sentence id="3408">We was supposed to from there take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klagenfurt</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3409">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klagenfurt</span>, we were supposed to come to the way near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3410">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was the Mur.</sentence><sentence id="3411">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mur River</span> is a narrow <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, but a fast flowing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3412">And we made a decision that we are going to form like a chain.</sentence><sentence id="3413">One swimmer, one no swimmer.</sentence><sentence id="3414">One swimmer, one no swimmer.</sentence><sentence id="3415">And I was leading the chain this here the 10 of us actually in a way by the time we stretch were almost, but not too far would we stand on this end of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="3416">But in order to hold as I'm starting to enter with my chain already linked up, a galloping horse with a Soviet, "Halt."</sentence><sentence id="3417">And they saying halt in German, then in Russian "Stoi."</sentence><sentence id="3418">In other words stand still, halt.</sentence><sentence id="3419">And the first thing he's starting to ask, "Who is the leader?" "</sentence><sentence id="3420">We don't have no leader." "</sentence><sentence id="3421">Where are you going?" "</sentence><sentence id="3422">We're trying to go on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> to go over there.</sentence><sentence id="3423">We're going to visit relatives, so that's our shortcut."</sentence><sentence id="3424">He picks me, he says, "The rest of you stay here.</sentence><sentence id="3425">You come with me."</sentence><sentence id="3426">Comes with him.</sentence><sentence id="3427">What do you think, I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="3428">So I figure now, I run a half of Europe over away, and here I'm being arrested by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="3429">Knowing their scheme of things and everything like that, I figure ultimately they got me and now they'll have a good right to charge me for desertion.</sentence><sentence id="3430">My wife realizing what it is, and I say my words to her.</sentence><sentence id="3431">I says, "Please, you have to have somebody go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3432">They must come and bail me out.</sentence><sentence id="3433">You know, the situation; we cannot wait days."</sentence><sentence id="3434">So immediately as soon they arrest them, so two guys went to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span>, and they started tending on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3435">To make a long story about two mile, they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span>, back with money and I was bailed out.</sentence><sentence id="3436">Now, where do we go?</sentence><sentence id="3437">We come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grozny</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3438">Now, I come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I get my group together.</sentence><sentence id="3439">I says, "You know, we are partisans, right?</sentence><sentence id="3440">Don't dare try to ask us to fight because we'll make a fight here to no matter what it costs.</sentence><sentence id="3441">If it means to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, we'll destroy it."</sentence><sentence id="3442">I says, "My group is going to be sent and you see you have Lusik, he is the guide; he is going to take it." "</sentence><sentence id="3443">But, Baba, you cannot do it."</sentence><sentence id="3444">I says, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3445">I have men stationed at all the <span class="DLF">exits</span> already, two men."</sentence><sentence id="3446">I says, "If you want to declare war, we'll make it war right away."</sentence><sentence id="3447">So I says, "My ultimatum is not to be changed."</sentence><sentence id="3448">I says, "The first group going out of here today is going to be my group.</sentence><sentence id="3449">Whatever more you have, I am not interested.</sentence><sentence id="3450">I cannot let myself to be chances."</sentence><sentence id="3451">I says, "I was bailed out this time, I don't know what the next time will be."</sentence><sentence id="3452">And I got Lusik to my side.</sentence><sentence id="3453">I says, "You heard what I said, huh?</sentence><sentence id="3454">And believe me, I mean it.</sentence><sentence id="3455">I'm not going to deviate."</sentence><sentence id="3456">Okay, it's settled, and they say Lusik and his wife, "You and Sonja come to be with us."</sentence><sentence id="3457">And they tell us we're going to go into a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3458">The <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> is on the <span class="DLF">zone border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3459">The Russians are going to try to search in this here.</sentence><sentence id="3460">If you don't hide well enough anything they'll take away.</sentence><sentence id="3461">They were looking for anything, , gold, rings, whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="3462">They were plain robbing, and we were paying them off anyways.</sentence><sentence id="3463">The guide used to give them -- let's assume if he give them some money 9 or Vodka, for a bottle of Vodka, you did a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="3464">And if you heard it said, it's not just said, it was a true fact.</sentence><sentence id="3465">But I was standing -- my wife at that time had a ring, other things.</sentence><sentence id="3466">So she did it in the old plan.</sentence><sentence id="3467">We had, you know, from knitting yarn, so she made a ball of yarn out of it, and whatever we wanted to hide, we put it on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3468">And with the needle, you know what I mean, so it looks very innocent that you know in the midst of starting to knit something, and that's how we got.</sentence><sentence id="3469">We did not have that much to hide to begin with, but some guys in the group -- not in my group so much as the other -- were people who had money, you know what I mean, that they had -- how they got it, speculating my things it's none of my business what they had.</sentence><sentence id="3470">And now we came in there, we were one, two, three that the Russians, and the rest of the group were on the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3471">And there within a few hundred feet or so we were on <span class="REGION">British territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3472">Instructions were given to us that we must walk very quietly because we are going to enter a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3473">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span> was a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United Nation camps</span>, and they are going to separate us, so prepare yourself.</sentence><sentence id="3474">The <span class="BUILDING">British office</span> ran their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like that.</sentence><sentence id="3475">The men separate, and the women separate.</sentence><sentence id="3476">That's still the old British ways.</sentence><sentence id="3477">So here we got in our midst some guys, coming in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I knew them quite well.</sentence><sentence id="3478">And those people started yelling, and I asked them please behave.</sentence><sentence id="3479">You were told it's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">English zone</span>, we must enter quietly, and we must not yell.</sentence><sentence id="3480">What are you doing?</sentence><sentence id="3481">Looks Sheila's hiding some stuff, maybe gold or who knows from him, and she remained behind.</sentence><sentence id="3482">And they're making yelling noise.</sentence><sentence id="3483">And I asked them to please stop, they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3484">I and two more guys grabbed the man by his hand and the other guy with the other -- we carried them in <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3485">There was a warm <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, we put them under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3486">After that the group of guys saw that here's a bunch of rebels, which it was the partisans and each time each one of us would look back, we would be looked sideways, you know what I'm saying.</sentence><sentence id="3487">And all of a sudden, it became quiet.</sentence><sentence id="3488">We were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for about two days, and one night we were told to get ready because pick-up time is going to be tonight.</sentence><sentence id="3489">The Fifth Army, which it was the British Army stationed there on the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, they had a big group from the Israelis, or at that particular time, call them Palestinian Jews who were serving in the Fifth Army and that was supported by them.</sentence><sentence id="3490">So they are the ones who were helping us, in other words, getting into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> from there.</sentence><sentence id="3491">And this is what it was, it was bringing in from one type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to another international United Nation camps in exchange.</sentence><sentence id="3492">But this is how the root was all worked out to bring people, you know, to each their <span class="NPIP">destination</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3493">They picked us up on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and brought us to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they were already on the <span class="REGION">Italian side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3494"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Clovishia</span> (ph) was the name of the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> nearby.</sentence><sentence id="3495">And for the first time we sat down over there to eat at <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, and, you know, the looks of challah, they served us challah.</sentence><sentence id="3496">We couldn't get it over, sort of we are used to before the war challah was served on a Saturday, Friday.</sentence><sentence id="3497">But here in the middle of the day, you know what I mean, weak challah and the food they served up, it was out of this world.</sentence><sentence id="3498">We were led in to take <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and clean up.</sentence><sentence id="3499">It was just like somebody opened up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to a new world in existence that we did not know existed.</sentence><sentence id="3500">From there they took us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3501">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span>, we were let to go in to join the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international camps</span>, which they were the Armra (ph), if you've heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="3502">They were supported.</sentence><sentence id="3503">In that, of course, they deloused us, excuse me for saying, and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="3504">And we were waiting for assignment of where, but it was warm in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> in that part at that time of year.</sentence><sentence id="3505">So literally in a <span class="DLF">park</span>, we were just with bundles on our back, whichever one had something to cover himself to sleep on and 0 we were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3506">The next day that we were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> rather, 5,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armed trucks</span> were brought in which they were survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3507">Among all these people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, my wife recognized an uncle of hers, his brother.</sentence><sentence id="3508">We were last thing -- he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, not in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> at that time because that's where he got married.</sentence><sentence id="3509">He was living there.</sentence><sentence id="3510">So now we begin to see literally face-to-face survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and at this moment on the way it happened that as soon he got registered, we kept ourselves together.</sentence><sentence id="3511">We made like a family.</sentence><sentence id="3512">Now, we are a family of three, and our next destination from there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verona</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3513">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span>, we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verona</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3659">Q: This was not five months after the fact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3661">A: They were just brought from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3663">Q: What were they like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3665">A: There wasn't one of them who looked normal.</sentence><sentence id="3666">When I mean "normal," one was swollen.</sentence><sentence id="3667">One was almost dying, you know what I'm saying, and one had more strength than the other.</sentence><sentence id="3668">And it just was a matter of how badly you were damaged while being there before the Americans picked them up.</sentence><sentence id="3669">Because remember, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> was -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> and all of this here were liberated by the American Army, and that was the zone -- you know, it was zones divided at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3670">In <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, for instance, there were the British, the Polish Army, there was also the American Army.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3677">Q: What was the reaction in you and your wife, when you met these people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3679">A: The reaction would be just like you come to a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">wax museum</span>, and you see faces.</sentence><sentence id="3680">And you almost pretend you see a living beings.</sentence><sentence id="3681">That's what the people appeared to us in the first day.</sentence><sentence id="3682">Within a short while, the picture changed to the better because those who needed help, hospitalization or whatever it is, were hospitalized.</sentence><sentence id="3683">We kept ourselves with the uncle of my wife right there, and he didn't step away from us and we didn't from him.</sentence><sentence id="3684">And our next <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was not so much where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wanted to send us to, but our leader which wanted us to be transferred was to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3685">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> they gave us where it was a <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> before, they gave us that <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> to make <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3686">And all these people, we were together over 6,000 people a group, all coming there, that was territory of the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="3687">So mind you, within a few feet away from us there were a camp from German prisoner of wars.</sentence><sentence id="3688">And since we were brought there, every day started, you know, throwing with bottles, throwing with rocks.</sentence><sentence id="3689">Just the face to look of these Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3690">Of course, the MPs did not want a bit about it, and we started to say to the MPs, "Either you relocate us, or you relocate them.</sentence><sentence id="3691">We cannot stand and be idle or do nothing like this here looking at yesterday's 1 Nazis who they did what they did to us."</sentence><sentence id="3692">And what they did, they kept us in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they relocated.</sentence><sentence id="3693">Within one day they emptied out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span>, and they took them away to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3694">And the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> became ours, and life in that <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span>, what can I tell you, it was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3695">Wherever there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> you saw people.</sentence><sentence id="3696">At night it was used to ensue fights because one would step on each other going through.</sentence><sentence id="3697">So it was another way of being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3698">To us who were in the partisans who didn't go through that type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, it was a new way of life.</sentence><sentence id="3699">We had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3700">In that small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, let's see, there was I with my wife.</sentence><sentence id="3701">There was another couple, I have even some pictures if -- you know what I mean, from there if you sometimes will be interested, I'll let you make copies of that.</sentence><sentence id="3702">So they were telling -- that <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there in a single <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, we were more than three families.</sentence><sentence id="3703">I mean, there singles, a few guys and there was another family who -- she comes here in the wintertime.</sentence><sentence id="3704">Her husband is no longer alive.</sentence><sentence id="3705">And they were with us in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3706">And it was mixed children, I mean if you joined the administration, they made an administration.</sentence><sentence id="3707">So they came under the administration.</sentence><sentence id="3708">And for the first time I had the opportunity to see a young lady from <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> coming in the name of, again, Jewish Tradition Committee (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3709">The American joined and they came to the administration trying to find out what kind of help that they can provide.</sentence><sentence id="3710">And we tried to tell them where do want to start?</sentence><sentence id="3711">Do you need <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blankets</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3712">I says, "Of course, we need <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blankets</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3713">Do you need this -- my demand to them was at that time they must get the children out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> firsthand.</sentence><sentence id="3714">Within a few days, since in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> sex for money was available, some youngsters, yesterday's survivors from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, wound up with venereal diseases.</sentence><sentence id="3715">And we realized that mixture and makeup of women who were married and women maybe who were pregnant and young children, you take this young child of 15 or 16 who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that kid cannot be easily told by somebody what to do.</sentence><sentence id="3716">And they listened to us, I even have a picture to show it, where one day they took all the youngsters out and they took them away to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> making a kibbutz really.</sentence><sentence id="3717">But that was a place where the youngsters were taken out and those who were venereal stricken with venereal disease had to be, of course, hospitalized.</sentence><sentence id="3718">But it was a new story of my life to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which I did not want the best of it to take, you know what I mean, but you had to do the best under the administration.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3761">A: Literally, we were a few months in there because of the ensuing thing.</sentence><sentence id="3762">As in now had started because they wanted to have leadership to know to go on.</sentence><sentence id="3763">We knew there would be forthcoming more of the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="3764">And | at that time was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3765">Near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we had on a <span class="DLF">farm area</span> over there, that it was an official seminar, my wife went with me.</sentence><sentence id="3766">And we had various speakers because it was a big political issue in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3767">While they wanted to save as many to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, it was at that time who and on which <span class="NPIP">side</span> will these people join?</sentence><sentence id="3768">Are they going to join the <span class="REGION">Jabotinsky side</span>, or are they going to go with the Ben Gurion side?</sentence><sentence id="3769">And with the Israelis it was immediately, number one, and that's what it started.</sentence><sentence id="3770">That seminar started to teach us, us the future , the leaders, because I became a leader and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3771">That was my best way of working my way out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you know what I mean.</sentence><sentence id="3772">Meanwhile I was assigned a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and that was a training place.</sentence><sentence id="3773">We started -- it was on a <span class="DLF">farm area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3774">We started to teach people how to ride on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractors</span>, how to do 2 farm work, while we provided this farm work for free.</sentence><sentence id="3775">But it gave us a place of starting of how to prepare until they would come with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and pick so many of them up, and they were ready illegally to be shipped out be by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or other ways to <span class="REGION">destination Palestine</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4013">Q: You're talking about what you mentioned before, the Jabotinsky, versus the . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4015">A: Correct.</sentence><sentence id="4016">The .</sentence><sentence id="4017">In other words, both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> wanted to hunt new blood.</sentence><sentence id="4018">You know, they were actually hunting for new memberships and affiliations.</sentence><sentence id="4019">I'll never forget one of the speeches, it was so many years later by Professor Garfinkel.</sentence><sentence id="4020">And I tried to ask a lot of people that question when it was posed, and nobody could answer it.</sentence><sentence id="4021">What does terror mean?</sentence><sentence id="4022">And a lot of people lose themselves to answer the question.</sentence><sentence id="4023">His idealism as a professor speaking to us, which he used, terror is an expression by a strong -- like he brought out <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, like he brought out the Soviet Union -- who has nothing to lose and he can get involved in terror.</sentence><sentence id="4024">Terror is also a means by someone who cannot lost anymore either because he has nowhere to go, so it's as a last resort.</sentence><sentence id="4025">So he tried to say in his speech, Professor Garfinkel at that time, that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at this time is not in a way that she has a lot to lose.</sentence><sentence id="4026">So, therefore, by going to go ahead and extend terror at that particular time, we may lose what we achieved.</sentence><sentence id="4027">So, therefore, we should go ahead and train our people who go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that they should join the left, , the Labor Party, which they were anti-terrorists instead of joining the right, which it was the Jabotinsky people who were pro-terror, that was their way of driving the British out and free the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4028">As we all know the outcome in 1948 after big maneuvers and 6 everything like that, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was granted statehood.</sentence><sentence id="4029">Well, all through this time we had a big problem as of to prepare the newcomers to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that they should be aware of what's going on at least on both ends and let them make an intelligence like that.</sentence><sentence id="4030">So every time while I gained at that time leadership to become a leader for my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was not to far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4031">I successfully sent away from there a few groups, that they were trained and the training meant in a way almost brainwashing.</sentence><sentence id="4032">Tell them what's going on while teaching him certain trades, and being the kibbutz was always meant to do something and in a grand way.</sentence><sentence id="4033">And since we made a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> to be near <span class="DLF">farms</span>, so it was good for us that we were away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4034">We could do more things that we wanted to do while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the government would not allow us for these here things.</sentence><sentence id="4035">And this is the way a network was set up of people to be sent illegally to bypass the British, because the British white paper came out at that time which forbade for the Jews even as the DPs to come legally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4036">So that's what had stopped a lot of escaping before the war broke out, and that's what had stopped afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="4037">But by hook or by crook, illegals were available.</sentence><sentence id="4038">These same people who faced the war and faced all its tribulation were ready to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> under all circumstances possible, and a lot of them did give their life right there in the first battles that ensued before <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> became a state.</sentence><sentence id="4039">Others survived and they remained Israeli citizens and provided a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for themselves and for their offsprings.</sentence><sentence id="4040">But the fact remains that these people that after going through all the agony of war, being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, us, the partisans from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, did not stop to say enough is enough.</sentence><sentence id="4041">But they still were willing to give their given years what they had with them to go to fight for a cause.</sentence><sentence id="4042">So again, we became new soldiers to go out and fight for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at this time, and no longer for our personal things ourselves and that was all about.</sentence><sentence id="4043">I did successfully have a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and any time I ask my superiors when is my turn to go, "No, we still need you.</sentence><sentence id="4044">We still need you."</sentence><sentence id="4045">They kept on knocking it down. "</sentence><sentence id="4046">You get legal passage to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and you'll get it."</sentence><sentence id="4047">One day I come and I have the new good news to break to them.</sentence><sentence id="4048">I used to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>, and we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> was our point.</sentence><sentence id="4049">And I tried to tell them, "I have good news and bad news.</sentence><sentence id="4050">I said the good news is that I'm going to become a father.</sentence><sentence id="4051">The bad news is I'm on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, how can I go ahead to do this here?"</sentence><sentence id="4052">And I did one thing which I want to admit to myself at that time again, a personal thing.</sentence><sentence id="4053">When I found out that my wife is pregnant, I took time off.</sentence><sentence id="4054">We knew that in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, there was some of the doctors from our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that were with us.</sentence><sentence id="4055">And there were two doctors over there, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockover</span> (ph) and Mastniq (ph) which that's how he was he called.</sentence><sentence id="4056">They both were surgeons, they saved a lot of lives during the war.</sentence><sentence id="4057">And that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.438611" long="12.326667">Venice</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venezia</span>, the way it's called in Italian.</sentence><sentence id="4058">They were living in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4059">I took my wife and made a trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.438611" long="12.326667">Venice</span>, ready to do an abortion.</sentence><sentence id="4060">I'm glad she's not present, she doesn't like for me to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="4061">And we knew that it was done, just like in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4062">Dr.Mastnigq, as a matter of fact, died here a couple of years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4063">He says, "Yes, we are doing it, Harold, but we won't do it to you."</sentence><sentence id="4064">I says, "Why?</sentence><sentence id="4065">Please, I cannot afford to have a child right now."</sentence><sentence id="4066">He says, "First, yet you cannot afford for your wife to have an abortion."</sentence><sentence id="4067">I says, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="4068">He says, "Look, there's a chance if we abort the first time that she may not be able to bear children.</sentence><sentence id="4069">You will not be happy not to have a family."</sentence><sentence id="4070">And I stopped begging him, I understood it.</sentence><sentence id="4071">And we both went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> brokenhearted which later on in years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I used to come to visit my father-in-law in the summer months with the grandchildren, and one day I go to my father-in-law, he says, "I'm going to say hello to Dr. 7 Mesnick (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="4072">I come into there and I show him my daughter.</sentence><sentence id="4073">He said to me, "Is that what you tried to destroy?"</sentence><sentence id="4074">I begged him not to talk about it because I did not want my daughter even to know.</sentence><sentence id="4075">She was too young even to be talked about a subject like this here at the time.</sentence><sentence id="4076">But it was sort of how much all the agony I could get, I even got it from this <span class="NPIP">part</span>, too, in the right way, and it was -- I was a joyful person after that.</sentence><sentence id="4077">Seeing that there is life and we got the <span class="BUILDING">rebuilding</span> to do.</sentence><sentence id="4078">The only thing we had to stop at second child.</sentence><sentence id="4079">My son was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>; it was due to both children my wife had to have two Cesarean sections.</sentence><sentence id="4080">And the birth of daughter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was a hard story to tell him.</sentence><sentence id="4081">So he gave me the same doctor, Manonovich (ph) was his name, he was also a refugee who survived from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4082">And he gave me a letter when I told him we are going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and he says, "Please, don't have her suffer.</sentence><sentence id="4083">When you come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, give that letter to a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="4084">So if your wife gets pregnant again, let her not go through with her pain."</sentence><sentence id="4085">And little did I realize that the same Cesarean section with my wife, by 5 o'clock in the afternoon, she got up, put her lipstick on, and it was, again -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, she was in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span>, the maternita.</sentence><sentence id="4086">She was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a whole month.</sentence><sentence id="4087">And talking the way people were nice to us, especially the Italians, they immediately understood that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4088">Most likely, I'm kosher; they did not serve any kosher food.</sentence><sentence id="4089">They couldn't bring it in.</sentence><sentence id="4090">Because I gave them the chocolates that I used to, Nestle's and Hershey that my relatives used to send me and the cigarettes, they permitted me, first of all, to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> so I could be with my wife all the time.</sentence><sentence id="4091">I could bring in food from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like chicken, and they permitted me to set up there that I could cook for her soup and a piece of chicken.</sentence><sentence id="4092">So she had her means.</sentence><sentence id="4093">So it's undescribable to see it, it was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>, but Italians were very gracious to the displaced persons who came there after the war.</sentence><sentence id="4094">And I thought I want to bring that out whenever I have an opportunity to tell about it and I just did.</sentence><sentence id="4095">So when I came telling them that, they said, "Well, wait.</sentence><sentence id="4096">You can still be working."</sentence><sentence id="4097">A few months later, my wife at that time must have gone into the eight months or so.</sentence><sentence id="4098">They say to me, "Now, with your group, you're going to be taken."</sentence><sentence id="4099">I says, "I with my group?</sentence><sentence id="4100">No, I'm not risking two lives.</sentence><sentence id="4101">My group could be sent," and I says, "I want to be -- from now on, I'm going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4102"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was kept through the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and all the other organizations as a place for the sick and the pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="4103">In there we had the facilities and the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> was very supportive about it to oversee as to find us <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4104">And they would give us a lot of voluntary help to go on, so that we had a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> there where a doctor were on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="4105">And the pregnant women, as understandable, were an important issue at the time.</sentence><sentence id="4106">We saw so much destruction and we wanted to see a fulfillment of replenishment.</sentence><sentence id="4107">So we were under good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, so if anybody was pregnant and they wanted to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>, it was an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, like send them there.</sentence><sentence id="4108">Then we turned back into the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anwar</span>, they used to get each month so much money, which individually we couldn't live on it.</sentence><sentence id="4109">But while we were living like in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, we could provide it.</sentence><sentence id="4110">I went back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, but this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> were really of people who were not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but they were waiting for passage to any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that would accept them.</sentence><sentence id="4111">And the majority did register to go, like I at that particular time registered to go the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4112">And we used to take, all of us, put in the money to sort of like a family, you know, together.</sentence><sentence id="4113">Everybody would get certain things we would sell because we could not adhere ourselves to the Italian foods.</sentence><sentence id="4114">Spaghetti was a new issue to us.</sentence><sentence id="4115">Polish people don't eat spaghetti;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4273">Q: Did that feel good about it, to be able to be a Jew again?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4275">A: It felt more than good, because like I say understanding that , which means I believe and being Jewish, this was the biggest expression by the survivors to give.</sentence><sentence id="4276">Much more than any Jew any part in the world who did not through Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="4277">Because we were the ones that when we came back and say we believe, that we don't come back with sort of blaming God for what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="4278">But the majority was when we come the conclusion that we always ask so where was man?</sentence><sentence id="4279">Why look for the invisible?</sentence><sentence id="4280">Why look to the thing that we don't know who and where?</sentence><sentence id="4281">But we do know where man is.</sentence><sentence id="4282">We do know that man did not care including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not give a helping hand to stop.</sentence><sentence id="4283">They did not open their <span class="DLF">doors</span> for immigration.</sentence><sentence id="4284">We know the facts that even the St. Clures (ph) when they docked which it was a movie made, "The Voyage of the Damned."</sentence><sentence id="4285">And a few among the people could not be saved even to let into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4286">So you can understand that any one of us who wanted to return back to Jewish life, who wanted to start praying again did a 9 big issue with himself that we justified ourselves and we turned our anger, not to God, but our angered returned to man.</sentence><sentence id="4287">And any time whenever I wrote something about it or I spoke, I still ask the same question.</sentence><sentence id="4288">So where was man in those days?</sentence><sentence id="4289">And I still feel justified with my question.</sentence><sentence id="4290">Not to ask where <span class="NPIP">God</span> was or where <span class="NPIP">God</span> is or what did God do, I would not want to find out that there is a God who really tried to have us punished because of something we did wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4291">Because I believe that God is referred to me as a father.</sentence><sentence id="4292">God is referred to me as a person who loves me as a father, and, therefore, this type of god cannot go ahead to ask that I should be killed, murdered, maimed, all of these here things for disobedience.</sentence><sentence id="4293">A father does not ask for that.</sentence><sentence id="4294">A father does not even want to surrender his child for something little bit he did to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4295">So when you say the return back to believe was easy perhaps at once, but you felt something is missing in our life that we survived.</sentence><sentence id="4296">And I believe religion was one of the basic things that we sought and we found ourselves in.</sentence><sentence id="4297">I have a lot about any results saying in many instances, but I don't want to -- this is not the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4339">A: I wanted to make a point, and I'll read already it one more time.</sentence><sentence id="4340">I said God is invisible to us.</sentence><sentence id="4341">We don't know where he is or what he is, but it's part of our belief.</sentence><sentence id="4342">That is, the , [ believe.</sentence><sentence id="4343">What I believe in something really that other than created by man afterwards that we don't have a way of following the Moses or the things like that.</sentence><sentence id="4344">But the Holocaust, per se, I do no want to make that a God issue, that God punished the Jews, that's why it happened or any other ways.</sentence><sentence id="4345">I rather would turn to the things that is visible to us.</sentence><sentence id="4346">Man is visible to us.</sentence><sentence id="4347">We know, the mere fact that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, being the most cultural place of Europe at the time it happened could produce such an evil man as Adolph Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="4348">And there wasn't enough, after all the tries that they tried to get rid of him, to rise up against him and destroy him.</sentence><sentence id="4349">After what he did to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> besides what he do in the process to so many millions of non-Jews as well as the six million Jews who he was having a war against the 0 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4350">So that's my interpretation.</sentence><sentence id="4351">I cannot see the Holocaust in any other way or form as the war against the Jews because at any time, the preparation legally he got them through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to make everything legal what he did afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="4352">Which I mean at this time, the humanization program, the right of taking away from all of them that they're not even humans; they're subhumans.</sentence><sentence id="4353">And, therefore, he prepared it so that the people should not feel that they're doing an injustice, but the people are getting rid of a menace or something, it's not so.</sentence><sentence id="4354">So when man let one person, one person's religion, if you -- I want to call it a religion, because he believed in it, in Nazism -- go as far as it was worded to let destroy people and destroy their offspring and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4355">How can I turn to ask for -- to look for the invisible or the person that I cannot speak personally or ask him questions?</sentence><sentence id="4356">This is why my conviction past World War IL past the Holocaust, remains that believing in the invisible, believing in the Jewish theology, believing in all the creation, that this did is something worth analyzing again, and it's something worth living.</sentence><sentence id="4357">And I remain Jewish, that's a fact.</sentence><sentence id="4358">I almost tried to get away with it as I told in my chapter.</sentence><sentence id="4359">And I'm happy till this day with the conviction I made not to work against the tide, but to go with the tide.</sentence><sentence id="4360">And I feel very comfortably today that I do not ask the Almighty what he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4393">A: Perhaps it's hard for you to memorize what we did earlier, but I did tell you in the most horrendous days of my life being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, that I was exposed and be with a brother to my father and he was a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="4394">And I have told you the way he was speaking to me, that we must go on and doing it because in the 14th century with the , God had so much faith in the Jewish people that he could put them to an exposure like he did, and he had the faith in them that they will not convert for the sake of remaining living people.</sentence><sentence id="4395">But much rather they were strong enough to say no.</sentence><sentence id="4396">Do you want to be Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="4397">And they remained Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4398">And, you see, the fleeing rabbis felt so distasteful with the trying to enforce on them that they threw on, as we call it, a herem.</sentence><sentence id="4399">A herem means forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="4400">That it was forbidden for Jews to return back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, even after the change of government and rather because it was off limits sort of to speak as in modern language we would say for Jewish to continue alive over there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4439">Q: Pretend this is the first time you've told me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4441">A: Okay, all right.</sentence><sentence id="4442">Being the fact that I was in a Soviet underground, for me to think religiously could have been a bad way about it because religion was a no-no in the Soviet system.</sentence><sentence id="4443">So even in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, we had the politicians come back to us when the paratroopers showed up and the whole idea of brainwashing restarted again.</sentence><sentence id="4444">So for me to think at that time religiously would have been the biggest crime I could have done after to myself, speaking in the first undertone.</sentence><sentence id="4445">Now, in my <span class="BUILDING">inner sanctum</span>, did I think of religion?</sentence><sentence id="4446">I used to look at the stars at night.</sentence><sentence id="4447">Being around and doing something and seeing the moon shining, and I would sometimes say, "God, can't you do something for me?"</sentence><sentence id="4448">So to answer whether I totally dissipated or got away from that, no.</sentence><sentence id="4449">That little spark was in me.</sentence><sentence id="4450">And I remember when I went out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, a prayer went up to me.</sentence><sentence id="4451">No more like when Jacob ran away from his brother, Esau.</sentence><sentence id="4452">And he sort of tried to make a contract with God.</sentence><sentence id="4453">Say, "If you save me, I will be your servant for all the duration of my life."</sentence><sentence id="4454">That night, with moon and the stars my witnesses, that's what my prayer was.</sentence><sentence id="4455">And maybe he listened.</sentence><sentence id="4456">But I did survive, but I didn't survive to fail him; I survived to go on, and I will go on like that.</sentence><sentence id="4457">I feel comfortable to bring Jewishness and religion into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and through my family I have been a member of a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> all through the years being in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, even at times it was hard financially to do so.</sentence><sentence id="4458">So on that question I must say I feel good about it, without asking the questions.</sentence><sentence id="4459">To me, it feels the same thing as if a young person gets killed.</sentence><sentence id="4460">It's a pain, but you don't keep on brooding on it for all your life.</sentence><sentence id="4461">When you're reminded, you feel the pain again.</sentence><sentence id="4462">But you try to go with your life without brooding on it all the time.</sentence><sentence id="4463">That's the best answer I can give when it comes to the religious during the war and especially after the war.</sentence><sentence id="4464">I'm happy that there are still Jews in this world who want to go on and live as Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4493">Q: What does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4495">A: In my life as a youngster on through coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I stumbled every time on a tyrant.</sentence><sentence id="4496">Be the tyrannical part of Hitler, be the tyrannical part that I've seen before Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that I've seen from the Nationalist Party, be it the time when I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and rocks was thrown at me by children who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4497">Not because I did anything to them, but it was always that one answer, you are a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4498">And it sort of became a theology, being a Jew means you got to pay in any kind of way.</sentence><sentence id="4499">So even rocks thrown at you means part of you because it's not thrown at you because you are Harold; it's 2 thrown because the Jewish -- you are a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4500">So I cannot help it but go on in the way I'm doing.</sentence><sentence id="4501">It looks like it's over.</sentence><sentence id="4502">You're ready?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4511">Q: You were talking about how you were always castigated for being a Jew, torn between tyrants.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4513">A: This is one part I tried to bring out.</sentence><sentence id="4514">I, for instance, always had to challenge a tyrant.</sentence><sentence id="4515">To me, the tyrant was when I remember one day during the war when I was with my grandfather from my mother's side.</sentence><sentence id="4516">And it was a debate at that time whether I shouldn't be let go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> I could meet up with the American Counsel, I can perhaps go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4517">At that particular time, my father would not permit me to go on my own, so he says, "See if your grandfather, after all, he's got all his children there, if your grandfather will take you to go with him, then you can go.</sentence><sentence id="4518">Otherwise, I will not permit it."</sentence><sentence id="4519">And that was the decision making that we had to take out a passport because the law came out whoever wants to stay here in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> must obtain a passport.</sentence><sentence id="4520">That's the rule of the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4521">Those people who do not wish to take out passport can return back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which it was sort of a critical kind of way.</sentence><sentence id="4522">And there was some who did not wish to remain under Communist regime, and they went and signed up to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- to the <span class="REGION">occupied Poland</span> under <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4523">And the fortunate thing that had happened at a later time was an unfortunate thing it happened then.</sentence><sentence id="4524">The KGB rounded them up by night on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and loaded them into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> they went.</sentence><sentence id="4525">Those people survived the whole war.</sentence><sentence id="4526">Some of them were drafted to the army, they were of age.</sentence><sentence id="4527">Otherwise, they could join later on into the Polish Army that Stalin created into.</sentence><sentence id="4528">And so a bad thing of yesterday became a good thing for tomorrow, but at the time there was a tyrannical thought and a tyrannical thing that I grew up with.</sentence><sentence id="4529">And when I and my grandfather together went in to have a passport, the captain and the police started yelling it "How come" -- he didn't ask a question why you didn't come any earlier and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="4530">But in a blistering voice he sort of dared to speak so loud to my grandfather, which my grandfather still had the beard.</sentence><sentence id="4531">He always had the beard long enough to remind me of Casimir, The Great, one of the Polish kings that were in existence.</sentence><sentence id="4532">And I always used to refer to him, in jokingly speaking, which he wouldn't tolerate that, of course.</sentence><sentence id="4533">So again, even a little item like that over why we were late and I come and making the passport.</sentence><sentence id="4534">I couldn't tell him I wanted to escape to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> maybe wind up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, that would be the wrong thing.</sentence><sentence id="4535">So I saw sort of tyranny in the workings.</sentence><sentence id="4536">Afterwards when I decided to be a good boy through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I volunteered to go to do certain jobs, and I started believing that working make a person better and everything like that, I volunteered to go to work on the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> level.</sentence><sentence id="4537">It was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> where they were building housings for the military at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="4538">I was a frail, in a way of speech, young guy who never did do hard labor work.</sentence><sentence id="4539">The hardest thing in labor I did was sawing, chopping wood or sawing that thing for the purpose.</sentence><sentence id="4540">Being a Zionist, it used to be a summer type of chore that you wanted to go help them.</sentence><sentence id="4541">The money that we were paid we used to put it sort of cooperatively, be able to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> where we was practicing Zionist scouting and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4542">But I wasn't used to carry a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrow</span> like, you know, that you had to be the husky kind of guy.</sentence><sentence id="4543">And I lasted two weeks, and while being there again, I found tyrannical ways.</sentence><sentence id="4544">All of a sudden when all the preaching to me was equality and Socialism, there I found out for the first time 3 of my young life that they had rates of pay.</sentence><sentence id="4545">One guy for the same work was rated one kind of a pay.</sentence><sentence id="4546">One kind -- the other guy was rated maybe less or

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4623">A: It justifies me of the past; however, I divorced myself of the tyrannical seeing and feeling unless I talk about the Ku Klux Klan, and I find that even in a free society as we live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, that in order for us to be free, we must tolerate even the people who are not worthy to be tolerated, but that is really our freedom.</sentence><sentence id="4624">Therefore, therefore, I am not faced with a tyrannical way unless I think, just think of the story with Skokie when the Nazis wanted to come and march.</sentence><sentence id="4625">In part, listening and seeing that people have still this kind of gut feeling in them to do to prove that Hitler was right is tyranny to me.</sentence><sentence id="4626">Because again as I say, where is man to understand man?</sentence><sentence id="4627">If I'm right, I'm right; and if I'm wrong, at least point me out where I'm wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4628">You cannot always live by the lying propaganda about it.</sentence><sentence id="4629">So "Torn Between Tyrants" is not any longer a part of my life, but it was definitely a part of me and part of my life between the late "30s until liberation came and then after until maybe until I felt differently when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4643">A: Let me bring in a little story over here.</sentence><sentence id="4644">We know for a fact that on many occasions that it happened.</sentence><sentence id="4645">That Hitler tried to use the partisans in focus among Jews, so what they did on a few occasions send Jews to go.</sentence><sentence id="4646">And they wired them, like I said -- not wire them as we understand it of today.</sentence><sentence id="4647">With certain criteria, they supplied them where to go and they'll take you in.</sentence><sentence id="4648">And your job will be to remember some of the things and come back, as their <span class="NPIP">location</span>, what are they involved, how much ammunition do they have, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4649">And I cannot attest to this moment that it was anti-Semitism because I was not there listening to the trial or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="4650">But the fact stands out that there were on a few occasions the Jews met their death, they didn't believe that they did in order to save their lives and were willing to give the cooperation of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4651">And they probably did it with the hope that they will be understood, so their argument was then why didn't they come clean originally to say, "Look, I've been sent here by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4652">I am to do this and that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="4653">However, that was my best way of escaping or coming."</sentence><sentence id="4654">So argumentive, who knows?</sentence><sentence id="4655">Maybe the person listening to their testimony at the time was not seeing the world this, he only saw to lull Jew is no crime.</sentence><sentence id="4656">So yes, it did happen in many kind of ways.</sentence><sentence id="4657">And Jews, even when I escaped and I came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, it was not as easily as a guy from the <span class="REGION">local areas</span> who did not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for labor or who did not want to be inducted in the German Army which they made all of those <span class="DLF">openings</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="4658">Although they had them in separate corps, you know what I mean, serving.</sentence><sentence id="4659">When they came and they escaped and they told their reason, it was on his <span class="REGION">home turf</span>, remember.</sentence><sentence id="4660">He probably was not from many miles away, he was from the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4661">And it was very easy, it wasn't a question will they accept him; it was a question only where is he going to be placed?</sentence><sentence id="4662">Is he going to be placed in our battalion or in another battalion, whatever it is?</sentence><sentence id="4663">But he had an easy <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, much easier than fleeing.</sentence><sentence id="4664">Now, the only time I could say that it wasn't a problem was after the massacre in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chita</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4665">After the massacre, for instance -- or before that massacre in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bentschen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4666">When the Jews came, it was another story.</sentence><sentence id="4667">There was, however, a fact that from Chita, one -- the most intelligent at the time would have been in our midst, who rose to be an attorney.</sentence><sentence id="4668">And he was party, which again to say that's what Hitler tried to do, to annihilate the first thing, then come against you.</sentence><sentence id="4669">If he once he has the brains out, everything will be easy for him to achieve his goal of the final solution.</sentence><sentence id="4670">So he, a man came and organized a group, and he came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4671">He's been shot, he did not live in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> more than days before being killed.</sentence><sentence id="4672">And again, what would you say?</sentence><sentence id="4673">Was that an act of anti-Semitism?</sentence><sentence id="4674">Was it an act of jealousy because he was intelligent?</sentence><sentence id="4675">Take it for what it's worth it.</sentence><sentence id="4676">I am not familiar for the time serving in that <span class="REGION">area</span> as a partisan, that a Gentile person was treated the same way as that Voretsky (ph) was, you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chita</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4677">That we know a fact, and tell you one more thing.</sentence><sentence id="4678">We had a guy by the name of Bo Levine (ph);

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4731">Q: So you're saying that for a Jew to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and be a partisan was a difficult risk?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4733">A: Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="4734">Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="4735">He was another story, and I am talking now when you use that word, "partisans," I'm talking about if he came and fall into the partisans, that there were Soviet partisans.</sentence><sentence id="4736">If he came into the National Polish Partisans or in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> part we called them Bondarises (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4737">These here people were just doing the same job that the Nazis did <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and they were poisoned by the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="4738">They were anti-Soviet and they were anti- German just the same, and Jew what they to.</sentence><sentence id="4739">So be that it was the era of the time that the poison of anti-Semitism got so many or be for or any reason to describe, a Jew was not treated to join in the partisans as easily as a non-Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4740">So this, for the records, I want to testify and make clear, that that was the case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4749">Q: You started to talk about the fact that you had to kill people.</sentence><sentence id="4750">You had to avenge those who had done you or your family wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4751">And yet, I see here a very, very sensitive man, and I'm wondering what gave you the strength and the toughness to do what you did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4755">A: I describe in many of the writings that I did before that humanity had to turn to savagery in order to survive.</sentence><sentence id="4756">Not because that's what their wish.</sentence><sentence id="4757">Even in my poems I say the same things about it.</sentence><sentence id="4758">It's very hard to describe the person you become.</sentence><sentence id="4759">To give you an analogy how we <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to escape in case of a fire from a tall <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and the facts speak that no matter how much training we do when the real fire happens, people still get confused and they do things differently than they anticipated.</sentence><sentence id="4760">And the bottom line and the final analysis is that the curing was not because of training.</sentence><sentence id="4761">It perhaps helped but it wasn't that.</sentence><sentence id="4762">The same thing, situations of that nature as in my way when you had to think only positive in order to survive, because negativism would only be a matter of how soon will you be dead.</sentence><sentence id="4763">Murder, beating, or whatever it is, but how soon will you be dead?</sentence><sentence id="4764">So you could not project or map yourself out a program that this is justifiable or this is not justifiable.</sentence><sentence id="4765">And at the times, I don't know if in a bad situation what I would turn.</sentence><sentence id="4766">When I had testified in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span> before the Nazis had to march, and I was at <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> at that particular time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span>, they asked me a similar question. "</sentence><sentence id="4767">Mr. Zissman, what would you do if Collins and his gang come to march on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skokie</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="4768">I says, "I cannot give you a real answer.</sentence><sentence id="4769">Am I going to grab a stone, and hit -- throw at him?</sentence><sentence id="4770">Am I going to maybe to take a bottle, take it with me and throw a whole bottle at him?</sentence><sentence id="4771">I don't know the outburst that it could project, this is why I'm pleading with you do not let these people march because they will only create certain evil out of people who do not intend in a normal way to do that.</sentence><sentence id="4772">And this is my best way to analogize or use that metaphor to you about it, how could human beings do certain things?</sentence><sentence id="4773">I know from facts because of police when we captured them and they told us.</sentence><sentence id="4774">Before a massacre or anything like that happened, the Germans, they did not want them to be sober because people under the influence act totally different -- act totally different as they do when they don't have that alcohol.</sentence><sentence id="4775">So this is -- again, I'm only using that as a metaphor.</sentence><sentence id="4776">People change at times of 6 horror or stuff like this.</sentence><sentence id="4777">I was changed, too.</sentence><sentence id="4778">And I want to be making this testimony right now.</sentence><sentence id="4779">Yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4817">A: Yeah?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4819">Q: ... what do you think was your greatest difficulty?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4821">A: Basically, at first when I was fighting the greatest difficulty was to get involved in killing because I still to this day do not want to use that method as what we were doing as killing.</sentence><sentence id="4822">It was defending.</sentence><sentence id="4823">It was self-defense.</sentence><sentence id="4824">Even the Bible tells us that if someone that if someone rises to kill you, you rightfully have the right to stand up and kill him.</sentence><sentence id="4825">So I must make that clear that our way was not that we were coming from a culture to say that that's the only way to do.</sentence><sentence id="4826">Our way was everything must be done in order to not let the enemy win.</sentence><sentence id="4827">Oddly the enemy was instilled in us and in me precisely about it, and I wrote it one time talking and interviewing somebody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4828">And I asked the same question, did the barbed wire electrified being everywhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, how come so few threw themselves?</sentence><sentence id="4829">I said I know and I heard of cases where people threw themselves on the <span class="DLF">wires</span> in order to get it over with from all the sufferings.</sentence><sentence id="4830">But that wouldn't that be common sense to say in a case like that where you gave up life and you know you have no escape.</sentence><sentence id="4831">So why let the person get the best out of you?</sentence><sentence id="4832">Go ahead and get it over with.</sentence><sentence id="4833">But the fact remains that life is very dear.</sentence><sentence id="4834">That is the reason we stop sometimes to eulogize one little child who didn't show anything in life, and we eulogize one little murder that it happened and we take it at the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="4835">And this always must remain a separation between murder and self-defense.</sentence><sentence id="4836">We cannot take it as for granted that a person uses a gun to kill to name him a killer.</sentence><sentence id="4837">He sometimes uses a gun to kill to stay alive, to defend himself of the other one who is trying to kill him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4855">Q: Do you have any thoughts on why more people didn't fight?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4857">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4858">When I first came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and for a while I was very bitter that I did not have a lot more followers like myself.</sentence><sentence id="4859">And the fact remains of the group that I had organized in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.392306" long="14.327071">Briesen</span>, not a single one after all the talk with it, not one who was on my group or in my group at that time, which it fell through, survived.</sentence><sentence id="4860">Not one.</sentence><sentence id="4861">The best fact again is with my uncle, that he came out of hiding, crying and hugging and telling me why didn't you listen to your Harold?</sentence><sentence id="4862">And this is a known fact of life that people at times do not want to listen to righteous person, but then they come eulogizing why didn't we listen?</sentence><sentence id="4863">And that was the same bitterness that I had in me for quite a while that I didn't, even though seeing the hardship and the facts that the bottom line was that I was accepted.</sentence><sentence id="4864">Even if it took me three weeks to get there, the bottom line was that the four of us, when we came we only found one Jew who I used to feel hurt about calling him a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4865">The man was assimilated, he had birth already, his parents were no longer Jewish and he was not understanding a single word, although the guy who came with me couldn't speak Yiddish either.</sentence><sentence id="4866">He learned Yiddish later during the period of time because 8 he was also sort of an assimilated Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4867">And I often used to, with the other ones, say, "I'll tell you, when I am here, at least I have a reason.</sentence><sentence id="4868">I am Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4869">I don't want to offend you."</sentence><sentence id="4870">Because I used to talk to him, I says, "Tell me, what did you know about Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="4871">He says, "Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="4872">To me, a Jew did not stop for one moment to think."</sentence><sentence id="4873">I did not have a guilty feeling that I am not practicing Judaism, you know, so I says, "This is where my hurt feels when I see your hurt, I feel I'm hurting for something.</sentence><sentence id="4874">And here I see you're hurting for nothing, so I'm probably putting your case above mine, so please never be mad for my questions I'm asking you."</sentence><sentence id="4875">And I still proceed to say more should have sacrificed their lives by escaping instead of just justifying the means that there was no way out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5012">A: To stay vigilant and not be different this case than the other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="5013">You cannot go by the story of what at that time Esau and Jacob were blessed by their father where he told to Esau, "You shall live on your sword."</sentence><sentence id="5014">While he told Jacob to be -- it's good, meaningful things and I believe it doesn't hurt to do both.</sentence><sentence id="5015">You can still become a rabbi, you can still become a student of theology.</sentence><sentence id="5016">You can become a student what you want.</sentence><sentence id="5017">But don't look down that it comes a time that you have to resort to be drafted in the service and you have to go to defend your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5018">I believe that's the way it should be.</sentence><sentence id="5019">We know past doing the Czar, during the other one, that the Jews were no good for anything but they drafted them in the service anyway.</sentence><sentence id="5020">They were good for meat for the cannon, for cannon meat, you know, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="5021">And there were, therefore, a lot Jews who did not want to go serve because they couldn't have the kosher foods, you know what I mean, served to them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="5022">And they would desert a lot of times because it was 0 against their belief religiously.</sentence><sentence id="5023">And in other words, why should I go fight for somebody that when I get through fighting -- the analogy would go again with the black people of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5024">That when they had to go fighting, they couldn't be together with the white man who was fighting the same enemy.</sentence><sentence id="5025">So there are certain changes must come true in life as it goes on, and the changes is with understanding.</sentence><sentence id="5026">So to answer you, I am still a fighter, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5042">Q: Is there anything else you want to add?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5044">A: Well, this <span class="NPIP">part</span>, I believe, you can talk and bring out more Biblical stories or more of the other one stories.</sentence><sentence id="5045">I used to say that if we were to hail after the kingdom of the day of David, King Solomon, we would have been another people.</sentence><sentence id="5046">However, we must understand that all of that happened when we were a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on own <span class="REGION">land</span>, and in order to be a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, we had to have a military.</sentence><sentence id="5047">We had to have an army.</sentence><sentence id="5048">But when we were driven out or taken off our <span class="REGION">land</span>, so we saw the holiday of poor what it tells us.</sentence><sentence id="5049">The story with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mordecai</span>, the story with Esther.</sentence><sentence id="5050">Speaking about it, a lot of people see something missing in the while story, that it goes on, and at times they are very despondent.</sentence><sentence id="5051">Because look what Mordecai did, he told is niece to go ahead and get married to a non-Jew, which it remains questionable to a student who starts learning.</sentence><sentence id="5052">That student has to be so much accommodating to justify that.</sentence><sentence id="5053">For the sake of survival, you do everything.</sentence><sentence id="5054">I, for instance, justify what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mordecai</span> did.</sentence><sentence id="5055">If that were the man that Esther had to go and engage herself to become that queen, that through way she could help her people if it meant her to go in on that thing and become at that moment to get married to a non-Jew and the outcome was that she remains the hero.</sentence><sentence id="5056">We don't call it the scroll of Mordecai; we call it the scroll of Esther.</sentence><sentence id="5057">So the whole story of Esther became.</sentence><sentence id="5058">So we can take it and see the difference.</sentence><sentence id="5059">If that would have happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> perhaps like the high priest when it comes when it come with the story of Hanukkah.</sentence><sentence id="5060">He showed, he and his sons were the first ones to rise and kill these people who wanted to switch him over to the Greek mythology at that particular time and become of a different belief and the pig and everything like this here.</sentence><sentence id="5061">But he was a leader, and he rose, so maybe if something like that would have happened by one of the conquerors in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, we would have had another story to tell again of heroism when it happened.</sentence><sentence id="5062">But since it happened outside the realm and the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, there was only one way to do, is politically.</sentence><sentence id="5063">And that's what Mordecai did, he did a political thing in order to save the Jews at that time of <span class="COUNTRY">Persia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5064">But it's confusing when you start reading at times and remain Jewish like the question is asked.</sentence><sentence id="5065">You can go on on so many various historical facts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5088">Q: Okay, but I don't -- yeah, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5090">A: But it's only going to come to the same conclusion, so if you want to dwell, you'll find it.</sentence><sentence id="5091">More and more to what I just am saying or said.</sentence><sentence id="5092">And I want to conclude in it in saying in order to survive as a nation for the years and years and centuries to come, we see the change and the change was started from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5093">We see the capabilities, no one in the world with modern weaponry had ever created a thing like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Entebbe</span> where the whole 1 world was rocked, of how they did stand up and do it.</sentence><sentence id="5094">So that's what I am saying, you must stand up, but you must also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5095">I'm all for the way it is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but I'm only against that one thing.</sentence><sentence id="5096">That they still give a person who is religious, they give him, in other words, a way that he can because of that avoid being drafted in the army.</sentence><sentence id="5097">I believe that cannot be done.</sentence><sentence id="5098">If that a person is a conscientious objector for killing, let him work in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5099">Let him work someplace where he can create his holy mission, save lives.</sentence><sentence id="5100">Don't have to go up, that's still a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="5101">A soldier who saved the other injured one is still a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="5102">He can still continue with his <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical</span> or theological ways of prayer and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="5103">But that must be done, we cannot exclude somebody because he is of religious belief that he should not serve in an army.</sentence><sentence id="5104">I don't believe in this theory at all, and I hope someday this will be changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5236">Q: One more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5238">A: This picture here was taken at approximately in June of 1945, where in my story I told us that we had in the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Modena</span> where we were stationed, it was about 7,000 refugees which 5,000 of them were ex-inmates from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, who were brought in in one day on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5239">And over there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was mixture of kids who came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, who probably were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> when they were real young.</sentence><sentence id="5240">And at this time, they were 17 and 16.</sentence><sentence id="5241">And it was a tragedy, within a few days these kids went out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and some of them got infected with VD diseases.</sentence><sentence id="5242">And, therefore, while I was working on the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> our first plea was to all the people who came for us, which it was the Israeli Army stationed with the British together.</sentence><sentence id="5243">It was also the U.S. Army soldiers which they were nearby.</sentence><sentence id="5244">I don't 3 remember the army or which number they were in, but they were with us.</sentence><sentence id="5245">So our plea to them was please get these kids out and let them be situated in a separate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5246">So here we see in this picture a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and we see the image, we see some Israeli soldiers, rather near me where I'm standing -- I'm standing at the side here, and next to me the guy, Vina (ph), who's dressed in a sports coat and tie, and then. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
