<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Could you tell me your full name again please?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is Norbert Wolheim.</sentence><sentence id="3">I was born on April 26th, 1913, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="7"><span class="COUNTRY">Norbert</span>, where we left off, we were talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and you had been describing its .</sentence><sentence id="8">There were some stories about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that you had wanted to share with me in particular.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="13">I think in in connection with the with the daily question we were confronted with...how do we survive, because once a asked me I should tell him something about the art of survival, and the answer is their is no art, so I will...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> it was an accident, or a chance.</sentence><sentence id="14">Uh certainly you had to have the the will to survive and I must say after the first couple of weeks or months, where very often I was confronted with the question, will I be able to make it, or should I rather uh uh uh put an end to my life in order to be liberated from the misery, but then after one year or so when I got the better job and could work as a welder, and also was able to uh to uh get some additional food here and there for certain activities, for instance, when I was was uh appointed a bed-maker and and also when I was appointed to be the secretary of the <span class="DLF">block</span> in order to keep the records, that gave me a chance uh then to to uh somehow keep myself cleaner and and uh also to...my my I would say was was strengthened by by by that...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="18">Q: How did you...can you tell me about becoming...how did it happen that you became the secretary of the <span class="DLF">block</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Well, uh because I II helped out to a certain extent to uh to uh to uh...for instance, when there was...when food was distributed, you know, there was a certain order had to had to be established.</sentence><sentence id="24">I was able with my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> French, for instance, to speak to the Greek prisoners, people from Greek who spoke only Greek and French.</sentence><sentence id="25">That was...or or or Latino (ph).</sentence><sentence id="26"><span class="COUNTRY">Latino</span> certainly I didn't know, but my French was good enough to communicate with them, or also with the people from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in order so that that uh ___I_ was trying to help and then obviously the secretary uh uh who was doing the work before left, so I was asked to do it and and I accepted it gladly because uh I didn't become an officer of the of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, but at least it gave me a certain chance to to to improve, which was...improve, you know, and and and and uh whatever improve means, you know...conditions somehow.</sentence><sentence id="27">Uh so therefore as I say, the the the uh the chance to to survive, the chance that, call it that on the morning you didn't know if the evening would be yours or in the evening when you went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, not to be sure that the next morning you were still alive...somehow turned more into the positive angle.</sentence><sentence id="28">You wanted to survive.</sentence><sentence id="29">You wanted uh to to to survive and and reach a normal world again, at least that was my feeling to, as formulated it once, to tell the tale, to tell the world this is...and and and beware of it that it should never happen again, and there were many, many facets of that.</sentence><sentence id="30">I think I told you last time, for instance, about the role the British prisoners of war played to help to strengthen our morale uh and when they came, they gave us courage.</sentence><sentence id="31">Uh uh I had...I think this we covered already...I had the good fortune to begin...to become their friends, so they shared the news with me which they got illegally with their receiver, so we knew that certainly the war for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was lost and especially after the second front had been established in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, that it was only a matter of time, and the question only was, would we be able to hold out that long and certainly we knew that the Germans</sentence><sentence id="33">uh were were loosing at the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> and every day was another step uh uh uh and one day hopefully the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> would would reach us, because we were in the eastern part of...located in the eastern part of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="34">Uh the...that was one of the things in which the British were so helpful, and also to provide food and and support directly uh and I was also the beneficiary of many of their good deeds and I'll never forget about it.</sentence><sentence id="35">One of the things which interesting was that one day a fellow who came...he was from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> because his father was a sheriff in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> in the British administration.</sentence><sentence id="36">He had never seen <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and when we talked, I could tell him a little bit about my experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and so we exchanged views and so we became friends.</sentence><sentence id="37">And he told me then one day...and then as...since our life was such a peculiar kind of life, without papers, without books, without...with hungry for for for some spiritual food also.</sentence><sentence id="38">Uh he told me somehow that he has gotten something from I don't which...an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, and I asked him, do you have contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">He said sure, through my military mail I have.</sentence><sentence id="40">He said I have an idea.</sentence><sentence id="41">Could you eventually try to establish contact for me with my friend...with friends I have in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">The address I knew by heart...you know, we had no address book anymore, but my memory, thank God, was good enough.</sentence><sentence id="43">He said sure I will, so I formulated for him a letter in which he said I met Norbert here.</sentence><sentence id="44">He is alright.</sentence><sentence id="45">He is fine.</sentence><sentence id="46">He doesn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="47">He doesn't know where his family is right now.</sentence><sentence id="48">I mean we had to be very careful and he hopes one day to be able to see you again, so this letter he sent out, and it reached my friends, probably after months or so and uh in the closing days of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>...I think it was already in December when when most of the <span class="REGION">industrial area</span> was was badly, badly smashed and destroyed...he was...all of a sudden came running and he said I have good news for you.</sentence><sentence id="49">I said what was it, another uh big uh big uh victory on the on the western or <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">He said no, but believe it or not I got a letter back from your friends.</sentence><sentence id="51">Now this was something which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> hadn't seen before, and I couldn't believe it so I was so</sentence><sentence id="53">excited I I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">toilet house</span> in in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were working.</sentence><sentence id="54">Uh the man who was in charge of that was also an inmate and I said, listen, close all the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and I give you...I don't know how much I have or not have...I have to read this letter.</sentence><sentence id="55">And I read from my friends who obviously did not quite understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="56">How could they?</sentence><sentence id="57">Uh said well, I'm glad to hear about Norbert.</sentence><sentence id="58">Just assure him when you see him again that we are the same friends we were, because we were friends from the youth movement, that when the war is over, he should come and be with us and and and and and uh uh he uh he should be of good..good courage and so on.</sentence><sentence id="59">So when I told this my very close friends, nobody could believe it, so I had the fortitude to bring this letter and to smuggle this letter with me into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was terribly dangerous certainly, but I wanted to show them also to give them some kind of courage.</sentence><sentence id="60">There is still...you see, can see even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, from behind the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>, there is a connection you can establish with people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and uh then I came to this count...to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in "46 on a visit.</sentence><sentence id="61">Uh I saw my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Decateur</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">They had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> there and uh uh I asked for that letter because I wanted to to make it part of my <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and they said uh no, they will never give it away, because...but what they...at this time when they got the letter, they were completely puzzled.</sentence><sentence id="63">They said, for goodness sake how can he be...they didn't certainly know which <span class="NPIP">location</span> it was because it was a military number under which it was sent...how could it be he is a British prisoner of war.</sentence><sentence id="64">What happened to him, so they were completely flabbergasted until I explained it to him, to them and they they they got aware uh that actually that this was something in which a British prisoner of war became call it the conduit for a message to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I must say this gave me a tremendous lift up and and and and and uh I told some of my friends.</sentence><sentence id="65">Uh he could hardly believe it, but this is what you could do with the British because there was this solidarity of man.</sentence><sentence id="66">They understood you.</sentence><sentence id="67">And they didn't accept any kind of anti-Semitism or racism amongst them, because for them the Nazis</sentence><sentence id="69">were not only enemies on a military uh basis but also certainly on a political and moral basis I would say.</sentence><sentence id="70">That was one of the things uh I certainly have never forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="71">There was also...I want to emphasize, there were other ways of spiritual resistance, to uh to uh nourish us spiritually.</sentence><sentence id="72">I think I talked about the service.</sentence><sentence id="73">But uh a typical example uh how how how spi...spiritual resistance can work is this example which I've cited very often.</sentence><sentence id="74">I met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh very early at my arrival, an elderly man.</sentence><sentence id="75">He originated from somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galatia</span> (ph), had served during World War I in the Austrian army, and uh after the war, after World War I, he had made his way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, had established some existence as a cobbler, had married, uh had a nice family, and with a so-called Polish ar...with a Polish accent, in September 1939 and he had been taken a prisoner and and and was shifted from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and so so he had, when I met him, already he had spent quite some years behind the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">He was a won...a simple man, uh a pious man, very religious in spite of everything, in spite of everything, and he said his his prayers every day and he always when when things were were difficult, he gave us certain quotations from whatever he had to to say well, uh they cannot succeed.</sentence><sentence id="77">Uh we were stronger in spirit than they.</sentence><sentence id="78">One day...it was uh uh in fall I think of "44...whenever it was, the weather was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="79">There was...it was a rainy day and the winds come blowing down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mountains</span> and we were standing for a roll call uh and it lasted and lasted because something was...went wrong, had gone wrong with the figures, and the the people there were not too good with figures, but if it didn't tie in properly they...you, you couldn't couldn't be released so we were standing there and and and it was...really, it was horror.</sentence><sentence id="80">People fainted and and and couldn't take it but nevertheless uh it went on so uh the the the moments in your life and I would seconds are minutes and minutes are hours and hours are years, and I was standing in my formation, you know, at fives, next to this friend and I noticed that he was praying and asked him, I said __, what are</sentence><sentence id="82">you doing.</sentence><sentence id="83">He said as you can see I'm praying.</sentence><sentence id="84">I said but I'm certain you said your morning prayers and for the (cough) evening prayers, I said it's too early, so uh what are you praying for.</sentence><sentence id="85">He said, well, I'm not praying not the morning prayers, not the afternoon, not the evening prayers.</sentence><sentence id="86">I'll sing a special prayer to God.</sentence><sentence id="87">I said what are your praying for.</sentence><sentence id="88">He said I'm thanking God, and I always was bewildered.</sentence><sentence id="89">I said __, thanking for what, for that misery we are in, for the for the terrible situation, for being forsaken here by God.</sentence><sentence id="90">He said you don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="91">I am thanking for God, God for one thing...that he didn't make me like them, the murderers around me.</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh and interesting enough, a couple of months later uh we had to undergo one of these infamous uh selections.</sentence><sentence id="93">That means when there were too many people especially in the uh in the in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, uh then the ____ and the SS came to the conclusion that they should uh uh...that those who cannot or were were too long in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> just should be exterminated, because they they were not worth uh uh to be fed anymore and and they had become, in their opinion, a nuisance.</sentence><sentence id="94">So uh this friend of mine certainly was an elderly man and had grey hair, hair...you can about grayish...and we were afraid that uh the selection would have would would would uh be his end, so two or three friends...I was already a schriber (ph), a secretary...uh came to the conclusion something has to be done.</sentence><sentence id="95">Now in connection with that selection I also, since I was the secretary I changed the dates, the birth dates, because there was not...we didn't have any ink, just pencils, so pencil you can erase easily so I changed some of the dates, especially of elderly people, hopefully to to save them, so and the selections happened in this way that you have to line up in a...and and people have to pass an SS man and he would then say, like like Mengele...left, right, left, right.</sentence><sentence id="96">In other words, to die or to live, to continue to live.</sentence><sentence id="97">And in order to save this man from this from this experience, we came to the conclusion that there was only one way out...that means to hide him in these straw sacks which were also called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span>, even if there was a danger that he would suffocate but at least it was</sentence><sentence id="99">seen the only way to do it, and he was an an old uh camp man and he knew all the tricks and so he said yes, I I'm willing to undergo this risk, so that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="100">We put him into the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>, covered him with straw and when the selection went on, somebody else went from for him and uh uh when they also checked the the the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, didn't find him in the in the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>, so he luckily survived and he survived also the the end of the war and just two or three years ago he uh he uh died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at the blessed age of ninety-two.</sentence><sentence id="101">There's another interesting uh uh facet of this which uh has also uh described in his book, --__.~;Uh it was I think already I think in the fall of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="102">We all had the feeling it's a matter of time because we were aware of the events, the the military events and uh the the second front had been established and the the Allied troops were already deep in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, so three of our uh uh our comrades who were old-timers, who were already there for years, had come to the conclusion that since you never know what would they let us...would they let us live to see the day of liberation or not, had uh decided they want to try to escape, which was not an easy task because uh first of all so many <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but also uh you can never...could never be sure of the population uh around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, whether they wanted to cooperate with the Germans or not, but they said we'll risk our lives.</sentence><sentence id="103">We never know what what the end will be, and obviously uh in the middle of their preparations, uh somebody had discovered that.</sentence><sentence id="104">Up to now we don't know exactly who it was, and uh uh certainly the uh the uh the uh the uh punishment and the penalty for that was death.</sentence><sentence id="105">Now the SS gangsters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as in any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, made a cruel spectacle out of that because they executed people by hanging in public, and we all had to stand there and watch and at the end we had to to uh march by and and and see that that this was uh the..that was the penalty meted out for anybody who would dare to escape, so one...and we didn't know for many many weeks, we didn't know what would the destiny be, because many attempts were made to to save them, but uh uh uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...1 mean the</sentence><sentence id="107">death sentence was usually confirmed by by ___, by the by the Gestapo, by the uh uh by Himmler's (ph) <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and then one day when we mar...came back from work, we saw the gallows uh uh erected at the square where we had our our our roll call, and we knew that uh that uh...we didn't know exactly what we saw...three gallows awaiting there, and then we got aware that these were these three friends who uh who uh obviously uh uh the order was...who who could not be saved and uh we all had to stand there at attention and the atmosphere was terribly tense because most of us knew them, appreciated them, loved them, knew about their courage and their dedication for fellow, for fellow inmates, so we were absolutely down and depressed, and then the spectacle began.</sentence><sentence id="108">They were led to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallows</span> and then one of the SS gangsters read the so-called death sentence, which was confirmed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> that because of their attempt to flee they have been...the Reichsfuhrer (ph) Himmler has decided that they should be put to death, and when they were under the gallows and the ropes already around them, one of the three...by the way uh uh one of them is the brother of our friend Freddie who is very active in our affairs in in <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">One of them all of a sudden penetrated this deadly silence with a voice which could be heard all over the the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he said it in German.</sentence><sentence id="110">I will translate it ina moment.</sentence><sentence id="111">He said to...or he he cried out uh , which means, comrades, keep your highs heads...keep your heads high.</sentence><sentence id="112">We will be the last, which means let uh...liberation is on the march, and certainly we will not live to see the day of liberation anymore but you will.</sentence><sentence id="113">And for a moment when this happened we thought that the SS uh standing on their <span class="BUILDING">towers</span>, on the <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> with machine guns and so on, the other guards uh armed to their teeth, would open a blood bath and so but this didn't happen, but you could see that they didn't feel good about it but it had a tremendous effect on all of us, and though it is now uh uh more than uh uh forty-five years after that, we are still speaking about it, still uh uh asking ourselves the question what gave them this strength, knowing that they would meet their maker in in</sentence><sentence id="115">minutes, uh to tell us don't worry about us, but you will have the uh the the the chance to see hopefully the other <span class="NPIP">world</span> waiting beyond the the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">So uh uh you see, and this this is this is this is uh just amongst the many things we we know from that time, proof that uh phys...spiritual resistance had remained in spite of the fact, and I can say for myself also personally, to say that well, they tried to make us a number but they will never convert us into a number.</sentence><sentence id="117">So this this this was, as I say, it was already at a time when when when when uh the <span class="DLF">air</span>, the political air was was so different.</sentence><sentence id="118">People still died uh daily.</sentence><sentence id="119">There was still enough victims unfortunately, but when it came uh to this time, uh uh uh there...it it...the whole, the whole atmosphere had changed when particularly when certainly was that you could feel slowly also the military effect of the advances of the of the advance of the Allies in the east and the west.</sentence><sentence id="120">In uh...I think it was in in August, early in August, we saw from from our <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we saw our first major attack by the American air force uh uh stationed at this time in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">They had attained almost completely already supremacy in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and they uh uh...I think it was early in August attacked arefineryin__I think is the name, and for days we saw the black smoke covering the whole <span class="REGION">area</span>, so we we thought for ourselves, well one day they must come and and also try to hit this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which did not produce yet but was very close to completion and sure enough, on on August 20th, 1944...it was a Sunday...the American air force uh to attack the --------suh_-uh combine...uh <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">Uh J at this time...at this day was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to to do some some uh uh paperwork, but I knew that many of my friends were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and were certainly concerned.</sentence><sentence id="123">Uh it was an attack which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes and uh what they did, they they hit the the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> uh uh to such an extent that that uh it threw them back for years in our opinion, but also we lost on that day approximately eighty people of our own uh which we said well, this is the price we have to pay, or as the French would say, la guerre comme a la guerre</sentence><sentence id="125">0 (ph)...that is the price.</sentence><sentence id="126">Uh one bomb, interesting enough, also by mistake uh uh went down in our own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which is outside of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...which was outside of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">Didn't do any damage, but another bomb by mistake hit the British prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="128">They were sitting outside of some kind of a <span class="DLF">trench</span> and uh uh forty of of those people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="129">They were playing gramophone (ph) music because they liked it so much to see the the the __ but then the bomb unfortunately hit, and amongst them was also a nice friend of mine, a man whom I befriended who who originated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, but also the British said well, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="130">That's the price we have to pay.</sentence><sentence id="131">Uh this is when we...when we went into action in <span class="REGION">Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">We knew that that something like this could happen so that was it.</sentence><sentence id="133">What we...what what uh we thought after this, after this experience was why don't they come also to to uh hit the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span> leading to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">We didn't know at this time that, for instance, Jewish leaders were storming the chancellories in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> uh uh to do something like that and certainly we we didn't know that there was a letter then written...I think under the signature of the then Assistant Secretary of the Army John McL___, saying that uh uh the uh governments have to concentrate on the completion of the war and also they are afraid and this is the the wording, that if something would be done in the interest of the prisoners, the Nazis could become more vindi...vindictive towards the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: I couldn't understand that.</sentence><sentence id="262">I couldn't understand that.</sentence><sentence id="263">Uh as I say, this question came up more after the war when I asked the people what...we we...on the other hand, peculiar as it may sound, we were so glad to see them because we were...when the attack came, for instance, , the only protection we had was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in <span class="DLF">trenches</span> where you could see these hundreds</sentence><sentence id="265">1 and hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">fortresses</span>, of flying fortresses, coming and and and and there was hardly any anti- craft fire from from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="266">Certainly our people, many of our people were were crying and so and and praying, and my reaction was, I said be happy uh to see them because you might have relatives sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cockpit</span>, you know, and and doing this work in our interest, and certainly you had to reckon that you could be also amongst the targets, but this is...in war, you know, you you you unfortunately you don't know where it hits.</sentence><sentence id="267">Uh so after the first event in August, after that very effective attack, we were put to work immediately to try to uh undo the damage, because they wanted...they had a certain date... don't know which...to uh to uh uh not to start production but to uh to also to get into production somehow, and I think the day before the deadline, the the bombers came again with another attack and then uh the next uh day, the next target to to have the repair, the damage repaired was I think the day after Christmas, and sure enough on Christmas they came again, and they smashed the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to smitherings and to such extent that nothing could be done anymore and there was...then the the morale I would say broke in this respect that they said there's nothing to be done anymore, so we were just trying to play around and play for time if possible.</sentence><sentence id="268">Also uh then realizing especially in December that the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> had become very close.</sentence><sentence id="269">We knew that__ had been taken and that that certainly that they came pretty close, the Russian army close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span>, and uh then uh uh in the course of the military events, in January when the uh Russians started their offensive across the __I think, and uh reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span>...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> was only, I think, sixty kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the east, then a day before that uh uh the order came not to wal...not to march out any more to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and the question was what's going to happen, because certainly uh uh without knowing the uh the uh the uh thinking of the of these SS gangsters properly, what are they going to do with us, it was touch and go.</sentence><sentence id="270">Would they dynamite the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then blow us up or whatever it is...so we spent that day uh more or less in in tension.</sentence><sentence id="273">2 What I had done in case they they should drive us out, I had put on my my British underwear and my British boots I had kept available in so in case we we were we were driven out, and sure enough...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="291">I'm going to pause because I want to know where did you get British underwear and British boots?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: From my friends, from the British soldiers, you know.</sentence><sentence id="295">They had enough stuff and part of it...as I say I was one of their benefactors and they gave me what...not only certain things I hadn't seen for years like chocolate and once in a while cigarettes which I didn't smoke, but gave away, but they...when I told them that and we talked about...they had wonderful stuff, uh uh which they got from the International Red Cross, that certain underwear and also I had a pair of shoes I I could call it organize from them, and they were very generous and very gracious to me.</sentence><sentence id="296">I might owe the the British treasury something for that.</sentence><sentence id="297">I don't know, but uh anyhow that's what it what it was, and uh yes...on August 18th, uh somehow we heard that the the Russians had uh uh broken through the <span class="DLF">German lines</span>, had uh entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">We saw on the on the <span class="DLF">road</span> adjacent to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we saw already all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German military trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and so passing by, but in the direction towards the west, so they were fleeing.</sentence><sentence id="299">And uh the question was will the Russians uh liberate us or what's going to happen, and then uh on August 18th, uh in the middle of the day, the order came that we had to be ready by four o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="300">We didn't know what...I1 mean we had no watches so it was...four o'clock was on their time.</sentence><sentence id="301">Everybody had to be ready to uh to walk out with the exception of those people in the in the uh uh <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> who couldn't walk, and we were certain that uh they would be killed there because they wouldn't let them fall into the hands of the Russian army,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="304">3 of the Red army, and also we saw the day before by the way, that a lot obviously of papers uh uh had been burned, so the SS got already uh marching order with the with the with the order also to take care of papers which could be could be uh uh used against them, and then on the 18th in the afternoon we walked out and also the the the women of the of the <span class="BUILDING">brothel</span> walked out and it was approximate...it was a a terrible wintry day, approximately we heard this...it was minus eighteen centigrades, which I think is less than zero fahrenheit.</sentence><sentence id="305">There were the icy <span class="DLF">streets</span> on which we walked, and that was the first time that I saw again the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="306">The uh guards were very, very tense and afraid because they were they were deadly afraid that the Russians would overtake them and certainly uh being in an SS uniform was not...they knew it would not be very helpful for them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="307">We uh...whatever we had, I mean we had a little bit of bread and that was...a little bit of...I don't know...margarine.</sentence><sentence id="308">That's all we could...we had to...that was for the whole the whole time, we could carry, and uh we were...as I said we walked and marched, so called marching order and very soon on account of the weather and so people people dropped left and right, and if they did were shot at...on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="309">Some, interesting enough, especially of Polish people, non-Jews (cough) who knew that eventually or who hoped that the population around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> would help them, tried to escape into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, which during the night was was was daring but still most of them were successful because all all the shooting didn't help because most of the bullets hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and not the people who had who had escaped, but for us there was there was no choice.</sentence><sentence id="310">We walked all night.</sentence><sentence id="311">We walked and and, interesting enough, we we saw, we heard the guns blazing.</sentence><sentence id="312">We saw the fire shine of the of the guns and any time we hoped that the front would come...would would be faster than we were but was hope against hope.</sentence><sentence id="313">Uh there was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to be made over the __-- which was aa <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and after the _, after we after we had passed the __, the SS guards became a little bit more relaxed because they were afraid that the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> would be blown up before</sentence><sentence id="315">4 and they couldn't make it to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="316">The whole night we were walking and he who couldn't make it, that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="317">And we walked part of the other day and then reached a place uh in called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholai</span> (ph) I remember where you had a a a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and they drove us into that and wherever we could find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep or to stand and and we spent some time of rest and then we were driven out again in the direction towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and after another day or so and a night again, we reached a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="318">Uh the people there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> had left already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> uh certainly also...by the way the SS (cough) __ certain travel because whatever they carried, they couldn't carry so long because there was not enough there was not enough moving material in order to to to uh to to...so they had to leave certain of their of their of their of their goods they had acquired in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they had to leave there on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> we spent uh a night, a day.</sentence><sentence id="319">Then they march us out again and we are told we will be on the way to uh another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">Uh during the night there were heavy, heavy air raids and obviously fights but uh the front did not reach us.</sentence><sentence id="321">We walked towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross Rosen</span> which would have been approximately a hundred fifty or two hundred kilometers or a hundred fifty miles, but then in the mid...we were hardly out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when we were told we cannot use that <span class="DLF">road</span> because uh for military reasons, so we went back into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and thought that would be it.</sentence><sentence id="322">It was not, so the next day uh uh we were taken to a to a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, to a <span class="BUILDING">freight railway station</span>, and there were in spite of all the military uh uh uh situa...in spite of the military situation, the Germans did not...had still been able to pro...to make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> ready for us and we were all loaded on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, approximately one hundred, hundred twenty in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...I don't know (clearing throat) ..-understand (clearing throat) they were counting us before we left, and we were approximately six thousand on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="323">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh then uh...completely exposed to the elements.</sentence><sentence id="324">No food, no nothing, so uh and we started to travel and then noticed that we are traveling</sentence><sentence id="326">5 towards <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and uh across the <span class="DLF">border</span> I think, and it was on an afternoon when we reached the the uh the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitkovitch</span> (ph), which is an industrial area in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salasia</span> (ph), which is already in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">Uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitkovitch</span> was a a was a big a big...tremendous iron works, uh still working, still in production obviously, and we were halting there in in a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> for a certain while uh and the people saw and and and this was probably just when there was some shift of the workers and when the workers saw what was going on, they took their packages with sandwiches or whatever they had and threw it into our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> in order to to show us their solidarity and to help us somehow because it was not only hunger but thirst which was which was uh uh uh really giving us trouble.</sentence><sentence id="328">We saw women uh uh falling down on their knees in prayer.</sentence><sentence id="329">The SS was shooting uh mostly into the <span class="DLF">air</span> luckily, but the people, these Czechoslovakians, they didn't budge.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="330">Whatever they had they gave us and that was really...that was heartwarming.</sentence><sentence id="331">Though we were in let's say in very bad shape, to such extent and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left then.</sentence><sentence id="332">People started to die, to collapse and to die.</sentence><sentence id="333">We didn't know what to do with them because there was hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for us to stand, certainly not to sit and uh so then some of the...especially where there were quite a number of German crim...criminal...criminals and so amongst them said well, the only way is to throw them out of the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, and that was done.</sentence><sentence id="334">And uh when this...the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was certainly accompanied by SS guards and led by two uh commissioned officers, one with the name of uh Mull (ph) who interesting enough was the man who was in charge of the gas chamber operations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="335">Clearing throat) The other with the name of Ruggers (ph) who was the the uh Kommandofurher (ph) we called him, in other words in charge of the SS on the <span class="REGION">factory area</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="336">Then all of a sudden the uh order came not to throw any any corpses out anymore but to wait for the next stop in order to collect them because obviously the uh the uh the uh...it had to became...become known that on that way of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh corpses are lying left and right</sentence><sentence id="338">6 and uh they were they were concerned somehow, the Nazis, about the effect of that.</sentence><sentence id="339">So one <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh where we stopped uh uh the corpses were were taken down and then these SS gangsters Mull and Ruggers came and said well, uh since we have the corpses give us also the mussulmen now, which means mussulmen are the people who uh almost ready to die but were not dead yet.</sentence><sentence id="340">Uh uh I must say to the honor of my Jewish uh fellow inmates we refused that, but some of these uh uh German criminals said alright and uh there was nothing...we couldn't stop that, so what they did then was uh uh brought these mussulmen down and then both of them, Mull and Ruggers, took their pistols and shot them uh uh on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="341">Uh what happened later with Mull we don't know.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="342">Probably he disappeared or was taken by the Russians and so Ruggers was discovered after the war uh and was tried in the in the courtin__--_--_ and I was one of the witnesses against him.</sentence><sentence id="343">Uh uh he uh pretended that he didn't shoot and he didn't...and the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was very tough and rigid with me to that I really knew that the people were still alive when they were shot and so on, but the whole the whole uh uh court procedure in my opinion, though it was a <span class="BUILDING">German court</span>, ..it was a farce.</sentence><sentence id="344">The uh the president of that <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was a was himself a political, political persecutee but who was afraid of his own shadow and and and (cough) I think uh Ruggers was sent to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for fifteen years, whatever, for murder.</sentence><sentence id="345">That that was all.</sentence><sentence id="346">So much probably he is now walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if he if he is still around.</sentence><sentence id="347">Now then the uh the uh the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> continued its way to uh to uh via <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and wherever we stopped and the people again tried to help, especially we were terribly thirsty.</sentence><sentence id="348">Thirst is worst than hunger.</sentence><sentence id="349">Luckily there was snow around so so we could have...we could also wash with snow so that...uh uh and then we left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and got into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">There was nobody to help us anymore.</sentence><sentence id="351">Nobody to ask...even when we asked for for for some snow or for some water, there was no...no no no positive reaction, and we were taken to a to one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> uh next to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and we were there for two or for two or three days</sentence><sentence id="353">7 and nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="354">Still standing there, trying to sleep and standing.</sentence><sentence id="355">There was hardly food or they they threw some bread into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> but but it was very difficult to grab it so...and I must say this was this was something which which uh was was then in history it's now called...it's a death march, which affected me very, very deeply and I know I had some kind of visions uh not so much to food but but to to be somehow to be under a <span class="DLF">roof</span>, not to be exposed to to the snow and to the elements and to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, a hot bath, and to sleep somewhere, but to sleep, sleep and and forget about everything else.</sentence><sentence id="356">Two days after having having waited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, we were told <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> were filled.</sentence><sentence id="357">They cannot accept us, so they took the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, brought us back uh through <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh at <span class="NPIP">place</span> which I knew because uh I was hiking there.</sentence><sentence id="358">Also I had spent some some some vacationing there in the <span

as I told you, on 18th of January we got out of of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and this was in the second half or last half of January, so as I say, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> was still alright and they took us and I was familiar with that with that uh uh route because I had traveled on that before between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">They took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411"

interesting enough, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> passed by one of the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> uh from which I had to leave when I went to work during the Nazi time in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="365">I was absolutely numb uh uh cold and the hunger and the thirst and so it it had affected me and but when they said we're at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, I was sure that this would be the place, uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen-Orianenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">And this is where they actually took us.</sentence><sentence id="367">A friend of mine who was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> next to me uh because he couldn't manage to be with me, was in bad shape

Norwegians but especially the Danes, in March, I think, early in April were taken out under the so-called Bernadotte (ph) Aktion, which means uh Count Bernadotte who was the head of the Swedish Red

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: Later...no, we'll do it later, OK?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: So we walked out and interesting enough, we saw already the German army in defeat.</sentence><sentence id="477">They were...we walked in towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saxonhausen</span>, we saw that uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> and and and uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carriers</span> had taken cover in these in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="478">We saw women for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="479">We hadn't seen women for for weeks and weeks.</sentence><sentence id="480">And we saw, interesting enough, also German refugees who obviously were running away from from the front because what had happened was that the Russians...uh and we didn't know that they were supposed to take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, that under the agreement they had with the Allies, the Allies and Americans were were to stop at the __, not to advance, but that the Russians would surround would surround <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and take it.</sentence><sentence id="481">Uh that...in in the course of that operation, refugees had taken to the <span class="DLF">road</span>, also to flee to the north with the hope to meet the Allies because they thought that when they meet the Allies they would be better off than to meet the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="482">So we walked uh towards the north, not knowing where, not knowing why, not knowing what the purpose was, but still under guard and uh interesting enough, the the the what the Nazis then did was that they had taken some of the German pris...uh inmates, especially criminals, and put them into into into SS uniform, so we were walking and uh during the night uh sleeping in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="483">Thank God I was a Boy Scout.</sentence><sentence id="484">I knew how to build...uh we had some blankets in order to protect yourself and also to come as close as possible,</sentence><sentence id="486">4 because the nights were still pretty cool...it was April after all...so we walked uh quite some stretches for a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="487">We saw (cough)...excuse me...more and more refugees.</sentence><sentence id="488">We did not know what the military situation was certainly, because we were cut off.</sentence><sentence id="489">Then uh uh we...we knew that this... my geography was good enough for that that I knew we were walking out of the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span> (ph) towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Meklenburg</span> (ph) somehow, to the north, and then uh we passed by, interesting enough, one stretch where we saw a terrible picture of uh dead horses and corpses and and and uh destruction because in the night before American fliers had had uh uh uh , they called it, had strafed the <span class="REGION">area</span> and since there were also military groups, military columns marching and walking, they certainly from the height couldn't see that also refugees were there, so there were quite a number of casualties.</sentence><sentence id="490">The advantage was that uh dead horses became a source of supply, especially for the French who knew very well how to get to the liver or so in order to to get some meat out which they could use uh because we had no, no other...the little of food we took with us was was used up very soon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: So what you're saying is you were able to use some of the horse meat yourselves?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A: Not at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="510">I mean we were...I was very reluc...we...[ mean we didn't believe that that...but you know, when hunger is striking you, you know, you don't ask any more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: When did you finally and where meet up with the Allies?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: I'll tell you.</sentence><sentence id="516">We uh uh uh were driven for quite a number...we drove out on the 20th, and we were walking approximately uh ten or twelve days already, uh stopping in one big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>,</sentence><sentence id="518">5 almost...it was just on the day of my birthday I remember, on the April 26th, we were somewhere in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, in a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> but uh and the question came up should we try to escape, but uh here again the question was uh uh to which extent could you rely on the German population.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="525">So this...explain something, if you would, because I...it was a little unclear.</sentence><sentence id="526">You were still then under guard?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Still under guard.</sentence><sentence id="531">They were still shooting if anybody is tried to get away and we were still...though we were...from the <span class="DLF">air</span> we were bombarded, but also the guards were still there.</sentence><sentence id="532">The guards uh uh were not very happy about this because they were also afraid of their lives, especially that that they would be subjected to attacks.</sentence><sentence id="533">After twelve days I think, we were driven to a point where it was was...all this <span class="REGION">area</span> is is <span class="REGION">forest area</span>, at least it was at this time, and when we were walking...a real pretty week I must say...I had some of my friends still with me, not to loose contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="534">Uh all of a sudden a bicyclist, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor bicyclist</span>, a German with a bicyclist came and said to the to the SS guards there, idiots, where are you going.</sentence><sentence id="535">The Americans are already in, and when we heard this, we became alert, because we knew from the signs there that __ could only be what fifty or sixty, seventy miles...uh kilometers away, so were ordered into a into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> there to stay there for the night and a friend of mine with whom I was together from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> all the time, he had the courage to take some horse...to to get some horse meat and we were trying to make a fire in order to cook it which was not easy because it was pretty wet in this this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and we were in the middle of preparations in order to get something to eat when all of a sudden from the back of us, obviously the Russians opened up with heavy guns.</sentence><sentence id="536">Now you have to understand we</sentence><sentence id="538">6 later realized that we were walking into some kind of a military pocket...the Russians in the back of us and the Allied armies in front of us, and uh in the middle of the night it was...no, not middle...it it it was just getting dark...the Russian guns really uh sent their shells and they came they came closer and closer, and almost threatening and at this moment I said to my friend...we...[ saw some of the Polish people, Polish political prisoners we had in our <span class="REGION">area</span>, said well, this enough, we run.</sentence><sentence id="539">And I said to my friend, I think this is also the time for us to run, so we left the the the fire and we left the horse meat and we left whatever...but just whatever we could grab, especially a blanket or so, and we ran towards a <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">The SS was still there and when they see us or saw us running, they were still shooting after us, but luckily uh our name tag was not on their on their on their bullet, and then all of a sudden uh we reached an <span class="REGION">area</span>...meantime it had become dark, where we were we were somehow in no man's land, but not completely because on that <span class="DLF">road</span> we had to reach, there we saw the the remnants of the German army, also trying to make their way to the north, and refugees obviously coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> with all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire trucks</span>, hearses, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">milk trucks</span>...whatever moved, they had used, and sometimes put together because they didn't have enough gasoline anymore, so they had tied...had tied these together, and we then said well, probably the safest is to mix with these people, and after all, I had thrown away the the the the stripped coat and I took...had thrown...not thrown away but put it my pocket the the cap, so I I looked at least like a civilian, and my friends also whatever they had.</sentence><sentence id="541">We mixed with the the population, and uh so they walked rather slowly.</sentence><sentence id="542">There was no marching because there were hundreds and thousands of people, pressing towards the north.</sentence><sentence id="543">They obviously knew that they were pressing towards some kind of of of <span class="DLF">army lines</span>, of the American army or the British army.</sentence><sentence id="544">Nobody knew who was operating there, so uh uh then in this way we were walking the whole night.</sentence><sentence id="545">We heard some shooting.</sentence><sentence id="546">We didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="547">We were even stuck by by some German soldiers and they said...and luckily we spoke</sentence><sentence id="549">7 German and we said the Russians are driving us out and we are going the same way you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="550">When they heard about the Russians, then they were...they were...[ mean, when you said Russians it was always for them a cause for alarm and when we were walking slowly and and and and and and it was dawning slightly and uh somehow...I don't know whether in my...I couldn't sleep and you walk, but I was dozing somehow...all of a sudden sudden a friend next to me said to me, Norbert, isn't that the American flag, and I looked up and sure enough there was a bend from one <span class="REGION">forest area</span> to another <span class="REGION">forest area</span>, and there uh uh uh was the the the the American flag, stretched over the over the the the crowns of the of the of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and uh with the with the uh headlights of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>...it was showing that this is now American-occupied territory and this is where uh the American army had stopped, because what we didn't know was that uh the 8th Division of the American army had been lent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montgomery</span> to cut off the northern uh uh Germans from the southern Germans....from <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> from <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span>, reaching the city of ____ obviously, and that was the 8th Division.</sentence><sentence id="551">And but at a certain point, uh uh <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> probably had decided not to continue operations anymore because they didn't want to take any casualties anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="576">Q: Let's take this back to you.</sentence><sentence id="577">What did you...you saw this flag.</sentence><sentence id="578">I would like to know what you felt?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="582">A: It was...first I I...the the the first moment I didn't realize that it's true, but uh when we saw that, there was a feeling of...we were laughing and we were crying, embraced each other and and it was unreal, because it was a feeling of being born again.</sentence><sentence id="583">When you are born you don't know about it because you have no recollection, but this moment of rebirth is something...it's very special.</sentence><sentence id="584">I think you cannot describe it properly.</sentence><sentence id="585">The human language is too poor to do that.</sentence><sentence id="586">Anyhow, this</sentence><sentence id="588">8 American flag, the symbol of the American flag, has remained for me something which I I I keep holy because it meant a new lease on life for me and for us, and whenever I see a flag abused or dis___ or burned, I feel deeply offended.</sentence><sentence id="589">Uh uh...just to repeat this...this flag was and is and remains for me the symbol of life.</sentence><sentence id="590">When I see, for instance, on the Day of Remembrance uh when the flags of the regiments are brought in, you know, your heart is beating faster, so when we saw that, there were there were...well, these few are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and and a few soldiers, but it was a very loose, loose uh uh...from the <span class="DLF">front line</span>, so we walked a few...a few hundred yards and all of a sudden we saw, uh on that <span class="DLF">road</span>, an American officer, obviously, and when we approached him, he directed his pistol at us.</sentence><sentence id="591">After all, he didn't know who we were.</sentence><sentence id="592">And thank God my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> English and the English which I had brushed brushed up with the British prisoners of war was good enough to tell him, uh said sir...and he must have been...later was explained to be somebody with a Texas accent, because I didn't...I had certain difficulties understanding...between his accent and my accent, it was not so easy, but anyhow I said, sir, we are we are we are your friends.</sentence><sentence id="593">We are prisoners of concentration camps and uh thank God we have reached you.</sentence><sentence id="594">And that fellow was was was...I mean he had seen action obviously everywhere, but this was something new to him.</sentence><sentence id="595">Now you have to understand, those German soldiers who were reaching the <span class="DLF">line</span>, had to leave all their packages, all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, everything...they were just driven to a big <span class="DLF">field</span> nearby and then the soldiers are looking if there was ammunition or dynamite, whatever it is, and then they tell to the soldiers to assemble somewhere to take them into custody as prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="596">The war wasn't over yet.</sentence><sentence id="597">So uh he said, you're welcome.</sentence><sentence id="598">If you need anything, you go and you can take whatever you want to, which means whatever there was on food, we could, and we were one of the first groups that there were with us were two of my friends and some uh uh French fellow, a Belgium fellow, a Dutch fellow, a Ukrainian fellow...we all stayed together, and when we saw all of a sudden all that food stuff and so</sentence><sentence id="600">9 we thought, well, we have to be careful because because it would become very dangerous because these were these were very uh fat things and it could be dangerous for our stomach, and sure enough since then slowly also other groups had crossed there, some of them jumped at this food, and and and and some of them dropped dead on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="601">So uh uh and then you know all of a sudden we were safe and we realized and I realized at this moment uh...well, I was with friends but I was alone, that uh uh I had...when I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, uh one day a fellow had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, and uh that was a time believe it or not that we still believed that women and children would be around, would be alive, and we asked him, have you heard that is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> there are children and and women, and he said are you crazy.</sentence><sentence id="602">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> now for a year and a half, next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">When you arrived what happened, and I told him that my wife and my child too was taken away immediately.</sentence><sentence id="604">With that he said I'm sorry to tell you there's no hope, and I still could not completely...completely believe it, though we lived already in the shadows of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and the shadows of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, but then when I reached the <span class="DLF">line</span> on...was the night from from May 2nd to May 3rd, 1945, which I call my and our second birthday, I realized I was alone.</sentence><sentence id="605">I was certain my parents were gone, my family was gone and and and I was joyful but at the same time terribly sad, because I couldn't share in the joys of the other...for instance, of the Belgium fellow and the French fellow and and the Dutch fellow who was certain that they could go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> soon and and go back to normal life and find their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and find their families.</sentence><sentence id="606">I knew I had no family anymore.</sentence><sentence id="607">I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore and and I had...I don't know...didn't know what the future would be, but really, that was that was what what made this moment so so terribly sad.</sentence><sentence id="608">Uh but nevertheless we con...we continued uh on that <span class="DLF">road</span> which led into the city of ____--_--..~ Landed in the morning there, and there you could see what a defeat of a big army meant...hundreds and thousands of wea...weapons had been thrown away by the by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="609">The war was still on...including</sentence><sentence id="611">0 machine guns, bazookas, uh machine pistols, rifles...you you name it.</sentence><sentence id="612">Uh we didn't take any of that to shoot the SS.</sentence><sentence id="613">It didn't occur to us.</sentence><sentence id="614">We were not made that way.</sentence><sentence id="615">It probably would have been better to do it, but we trusted uh that justice would would prevail and that that these criminals would would would get what they deserved to.</sentence><sentence id="616">Well, that's another story.</sentence><sentence id="617">We reached the cityof We came to the...we were directed to the to the...by the way, on the way we saw, for instance, American troops.</sentence><sentence id="618">They were they were cold, but they had put on a fire and they had gotten somewhere bundles of German marks, you know.</sentence><sentence id="619">They were using these bundles to to lit a fire, and came...we were directed to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was called military government...that was new to me.</sentence><sentence id="620">Military government...I didn't know what it meant, but it was closed.</sentence><sentence id="621">Six o'clock...there was no <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours, you know.</sentence><sentence id="622">So uh uh and and uh I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="623">One of my friends I was with was very sick.</sentence><sentence id="624">He could hardly walk anymore, so I then took the initiative and uh went into into one of these uh uh <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in _, and I was told by that French fellow that...the lady was nice enough.</sentence><sentence id="625">She gave him some some some water so that he could could wash himself and so I went, and I had in my pocket still twenty German marks I had smuggled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and I went to that lady and said uh I need two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for for my friends and myself.</sentence><sentence id="626">We are this and that and says well difficulties...the families are evacuated, fled from the Russians and so...and you know, at this time you didn't accept these these apologies and so I said I need two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="627">And as a token of my good will, I give you my last twenty marks, so luckily we found these <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, so then we could somehow clean ourselves after all these days and those ten days...I mean we looked terrible.</sentence><sentence id="628">I shaved again, but I ___ and _I put our friend who was in very very bad shape shape to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I was looking for for for help.</sentence><sentence id="629">I went back to the military government.</sentence><sentence id="630">I was coming and going and I said for goodness sake, amongst these people there must be some of my old friends from the youth movement and so have joined the army.</sentence><sentence id="631">Eventually I could meet some of them.</sentence><sentence id="632">And all of a</sentence><sentence id="634">1 sudden I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> uh driving up and uh a man came down and a racial mark... thought he was Jewish...a hefty fellow.</sentence><sentence id="635">I approached him and, you know, at these days uh the the troops they were carrying their pistol mostly on on in front of them or or they had these short machine guns and so uh so I approached him, and asked are you Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="636">And he said yes, but what's it your business, and I whispered to him uh I'm also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="637">He said for dancing (ph)...what are you doing here.</sentence><sentence id="638">And so I told him.</sentence><sentence id="639">I said uh just hours ago your Army liberated me and a few of my friends.</sentence><sentence

destroyed, so we had already started to try to organize some kind of a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, because there were two, three or four Jews married to non-Jewesses who had been saved, and you know about the community and so, so they all wanted to know what could they achieve.</sentence><sentence id="887">I said they achieve nothing, just to hope that something will happen, but and then work on it to uh to uh to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> two weeks later, which was not easy because I was still...they have strict controls but I was able in

was very...made very clear and we had accepted already that <span class="DLF">line</span> that certainly the the emphasis is that people want to go to then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, but also those who want to join their relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, should been given the opportunity as soon as possible to do this because Europe is one big <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> for us, and therefore we we we we uh we we...the sooner the better we we'll get out because otherwise it will be demoralizing to stay with a population which considers us as</sentence><sentence id="1055">2 enemies just just only weeks ago, and uh to start again what what the generation did for us...establish a career, establish uh uh a business or what...we are not tempted to do that, and uh so uh as I say with difficulties I managed to make that statement and uh I felt...what can I say...uh very very __ (laughter).</sentence><sentence id="1056">So interesting enough, I...half an hour later I met Harrison in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and and he was a wonderful man, by the way...charming, warm-hearted, compassionate and I said I'm sorry but uh this is my English.</sentence><sentence id="1057">I hope I can...one day it will be better, and he said don't you worry.</sentence><sentence id="1058">It's not important how good you speak in English.</sentence><sentence id="1059">It is the meaning of what you try to bring out which is important to me, and this is what I will try to bring to the President, and sure enough, as you know, Harrison immediately went back uh so gave this uh uh report to uh to uh to uh President Truman and Truman almost immediately then used this report to...he could only give directives to Eisenhower in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, but at the same time then with a request that a hundred thousand DP's should be should be given the opportunity to to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> immediately for for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and this and that, so uh uh in this respect the Earl...the Earl Harrison mission was, I would say, a milestone.</sentence><sentence id="1060">It wasn't as successful as as we had hoped, because things were still too much in turmoil in these days.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Uh the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was was was not in existence.</sentence><sentence id="1062">The British were stubborn in their policy not to admit, and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was still before the DP bill, strictly adhering to the to the quotas, but uh uh somehow it had, I would say it had penetrated the <span

id="1096">A: Uh well, after the Harrison mission...but I had started before already...we concentrated mainly in our...first of all to to organize our committee, to our committee, uh uh in other words taking in whoever wanted to be represented of the of the camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> along certain call it party line...labor and and so on, I mean the old, the old tradition from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had been carried on also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, but the other...because also to bring all these people outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> into the fold, into the committee which means communities uh uh which were which were organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> (ph), and and and , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and so on, and we...we then were able, interesting enough, to uh to have a united central committee of Jews originating from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, from wherever it was, in one <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> in order to try to work on whatever the problems of the day were.</sentence><sentence id="1097">One of the problems we had at the beginning immediately was that for instance people of German nationality were treated by the occupational authorities as German nationals and they were told that they can have help only from</sentence><sentence id="1099">4 the...could get help only from German mayor (ph), which was absurd, it was at this time, but we...that was one of the the ideological contacts and in this respect and and " _____ and all the other friends who were with us in the central committee, this is...call it some kind of heritage we are taking along with us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that we had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh uh experience, not as Germans or Lithuanians or Poles or or Hungarians but as Jews, and that therefore the the solution of our problem could only be found in in finding an answer to the Jewish needs.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Now that certainly was to to find a way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, uh one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Uh there were other dire dire needs at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Uh uh we talk about food, clothing, religious needs.</sentence><sentence id="1103">Uh there was also a a problem to bring relatives together.</sentence><sentence id="1104">Uh men were looking for their wives, hoped...in the hope to find them.</sentence><sentence id="1105">Wives are looking for their children to to find them.</sentence><sentence id="1106">We prepared lists, for instance, which were uh uh exchanged with the with the people in in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Uh but also uh at the beginning very strongly that help should be forthcoming to alleviate the physical situation, and in this respect then luckily the Joint was able to bring the first uh supplies in and in that committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, it was decided that everybody should get the same, irrespective of origin, irrespective of whatever it was, whether living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> or living outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, and and that worked well.</sentence><sentence id="1108">We had some kind of a we called it, which means economical uh department and we got together with the Joint and with the Jewish relief unit and we were sitting together checking the needs and then making the distribution and the central committee had a say in all this and not only that we were working together.</sentence><sentence id="1109">We were very proud of this in in organizational ways but we became very good friends.</sentence><sentence id="1110">It was it was really a a deep friendship which developed and which it lasted for a long time after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bel...Belsen</span> already and which manifested itself whether there was uh many weddings, for instance, occurred and we went there together and there came came came __and there came came came all kinds of occasions and we</sentence><sentence id="1112">5 were we were always together and and and uh I would say in this respect, I must say, Joseph (ph) and ___ were very instrumental in developing an atmosphere in which you did not only (cough) discuss business but also asked, you know that Yiddish expression ..what is going on with the family, what...and people then revealed what what what what their their innermost...what's bothering them and so so you knew you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you could exchange not only views but your mood with with with friends.</sentence><sentence id="1113">Uh it was not always easy.</sentence><sentence id="1114">We had a situation, for instance, when the British decided that uh uh uh people who had tried to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> illegally...the Exodus, with the famous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Exodus ship</span>...should be brought back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were were then forced to to land in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and were brought to two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> near the place where I had my my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my transitory home near __ and that was a very, very difficult uh situation for us because tensions were high.</sentence><sentence id="1115">Amongst those people who had been brought back in force were our friends and relatives and so it...we had a a terrible responsibility somehow to regulate the tension because there were people, certainly militant people who wanted to take it out on the British and uh we felt as responsible leaders that we should try to avoid it.</sentence><sentence id="1116">After all uh ___ was the spokesman of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1117">I was accredited to the British authorities as a spokesman for Jews living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, so we had a certain standing but what was more important, we had also established a close uh <span class="DLF">line</span> to our friends of the World Jewish Council in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> uh who as members of Parliament like Sidney Silverman andand and , were able to help us in whatever was to helped.</sentence><sentence id="1118">Two fold as I say...with the the help of food and and...and also the religious help.</sentence><sentence id="1119"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, for instance, helped the people in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around with --__, with with with religious people and so but the other work we were involved in was call it political work...to know that this is a transitory existence, that living...that life in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is no normal life, that it has to come to an end, and that's the reason why when _ and | were traveling very often</sentence><sentence id="1121">6 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and we had...with our friends of the World Jewish Congress...we had meetings with the politicians, with the head of government, not with a representative, interesting enough, of the British Army or the British Military Government in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but we met very often with the with the...because we had a shorter <span class="DLF">line</span> __--.~You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> everything had to go through channels and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with the help of our friends, we didn't need that and uh Joseph (ph) was one of the first ones to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1122">He was the first , the first messenger and and lift up interest for a for a solution (coughing) and he did not uh uh...that was not a fund raising speech.</sentence><sentence id="1123">These were not fund raising speeches he made.</sentence><sentence id="1124">He made speeches just to say don't let us rot away in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Don't let us...don't leave us alone to repeat this.</sentence><sentence id="1126">We are liberated but we are not free.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And we don't feel free before we have a chance to build a new existence, wherever it was...in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or wherever it is, but a normal existence for for our families and for ourself in order to reestablish life and a new career and and and and to make our own contributions.</sentence><sentence id="1128">This went on...we had this for...1 remember uh uh that things were were so terribly difficult in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.____</sentence><sentence id="1129">and I met uh and that was at a very very difficult time and we needed badly moral support uh in order...because the people really almost got got into despair, and what could we...what could we tell them time and again.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Have hope and it will become better and so...so we asked uh to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he said no, I can't, uh for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1131">Number one my foot will never touch the bloody soil of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> again, and number two, what kind...what kind of a message can I bring to the survivors...lies.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I cannot bring lies.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And there is nothing I can bring them.</sentence><sentence id="1134">These were the situations under which we were working, and uh then luckily uh you know, came came the development after Exodus which was a really a very difficult chapter, that then in in in May 1948, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was created as a state and then slowly but surely we knew that those who wanted to go to then <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would would would be able.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Not immediately because there was a</sentence><sentence id="1137">7 technical problem.</sentence><sentence id="1138">Uh <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was at war with the Arab neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="1139">Uh people volunteered to go to <span

the _____and and gave their life away, especially in the battle of , had hardly seen the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and were killed in action, so it was a was a was a troublesome uh time but then slowly but surely things got organized and the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> could be could be could be uh uh uh...I wouldn't say cleaned out but could could be evacuated with...and also then the...luckily the uh the uh DP bill came into action, so people who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had the chance to do so, but the Americans had an interesting practice.</sentence><sentence id="1142">First they they they take care of the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so the people in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> had to wait, but it was all not that easy either, because I remember when I came...was invited by the United Jewish Appeal in 1946 to come and to bring the message to the Jews of of of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the west...in the east and also was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> and at this time I reported about the situation, that that not even the the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> available were be...were used, and uh but that in in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, but that in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, they were...they had made already...they had begun to do this, and I went to the head of the immigration department.</sentence><sentence id="1143">I think I was taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> here, and uh this man...obviously he was not the smartest...gave us as an answer that they have not enough funds available in order to establish <span class="BUILDING">processing centers</span> for security, to to check security and so on, so the man I was with then was was leading our delegation, said if that is so sir, I might suggest to the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to make a fund raising for the government of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in order to uh to uh finance the immigration department, but still it didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="1144">But when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>...uh DP bill came into into... mean was was started, then slowly all those who wanted to leave left and that was the majority of the DP's.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Some were left.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Some had built uh built new lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">I don't want to talk about that, but those...and I must say then we felt that our job in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was</sentence><sentence id="1149">8 done and that we could leave because...but it took us longer than we thought.</sentence><sentence id="1150">It was almost five years after until until until uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> ceased to exist and also uh uh uh those who couldn't leave then found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> or so for medical reasons or other reasons, so that was then and and I decided then also to leave to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1151">I was asked by my friend...at this time I had already started to take...to have uh contact with the progressive uh forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...progressive political forces and and and was asked why did you leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">Uh we need you here and I said listen, I haven't destroyed <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1153">I have no duty to build it to build it up again, and I I can't.</sentence><sentence id="1154">For me, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is one big <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">I have nobody here, and in the meantime I'm married again.</sentence><sentence id="1156">I found a lady from my youth movement and married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1157">I married her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1158">We had two children in and then we came to the conclusion that also in the interest of the children, we would not stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and this is then when we decided to to uh to uh leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1159">There was still another job to be done in which I participated and that was uh uh...that was under the military statute, a so-called successor organization was built to claim the heirless and community property of the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="1160">This was under Allied law with the seat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and uh I became one of the founders and we were able then to solve the problems by putting all the funds which which which uh accumulated out of community property which was not used by new communities, and heirless property into one fund and uh this fund was administered by a mutual committee of the communities and the major Jewish organizations and then distributed especially for social purposes for needed people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and in in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, so that was the Jewish Trust Corporation and and and then I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1161">I landed in and was in 1952 together with my then wife and my two children.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1235">9 Answer.</sentence><sentence id="1236">Uh uh I I learned one lesson from my from my teacher, my spiritual mentor, Leo Beck (ph), who said <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is not the country of social continuity.</sentence><sentence id="1237">In other words, what I had done in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, studying law and being a social worker and so on, wouldn't work, and then after a certain while many friends advised me if I would still have...like to do something with law so many newcomers, especially of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, had had had found uh uh a way to establish themselves and have a career in the field of accountancy, so uh I I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1238">Luckily <span class="BUILDING">NYU</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span>, was generous enough to give me certain credit points for my studies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I took up the uh the uh studies of accounting...of public...and became a public accountant.</sentence><sentence id="1239">I never was an enthusiastic auditor or or or tax tax preparer, but it was a a profession which which uh uh guaranteed me an income to give my family whatever was required and and to make a aa call it comfortable life and uh this is what I did uh from the moment then when I entered the professional life and uh uh until recently when I retired after having done enough uh coming to the conclusion that whatever I had done for ___--_--sw would never be enough in order to meet the requirements of the budget, so uh uh as I say I was...but irrespective of the of the of the accounting business, I still kept my interest in in in organizational work.</sentence><sentence id="1240">Certainly at the beginning I had to establish first my family.</sentence><sentence id="1241">I had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and and so on and get settled uh and uh then I I also took some time out to do something for for other things again.</sentence><sentence id="1242">I, for instance, there was when I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> one day uh ___, which is the equivalent of of the duPont in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, uh star...published a a statement saying that the former stockholders should uh file...should register their claims.</sentence><sentence id="1243">Now I told you before that we worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> --_--s was <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there, but that we never got a penny from them paid at whatever...that we just uh uh worked in order to

records had had been lost somehow and they wanted to register the stockholders and claims which certain people had against __----_--, so they published that statement and there all of a sudden I had a brain-storm, and I said if they ask for claims to be registered, I think that we also...I also have a claim.</sentence><sentence id="1246">They never paid me a penny for my slave work.</sentence><sentence id="1247">Uh I'm entitled to something, and I approached with this question in mind, a man who I had befriended when I was living in____--&lt;&lt;..~*He was a refugee from

long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and he had then become an officer in the control commission, regulating the admission of people to the press, to the movies and so and I met him when I became a

class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to open a practice again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, and him I approached with the question.</sentence><sentence id="1249">I said what do you

dynamite in that.</sentence><sentence id="1252">Nobody can tell you you'll be successful, but this is...by all means you should bring suit, so my friend ___ alright.</sentence><sentence id="1253">I'll take the case, and we brought suit against sin my name and uh then all of a sudden when the papers started to write about it and uh then there was a trial in in <span

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">German District Court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> under the German law saying that the people like me had worked under the...in the shadow of death, in the shadow of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, that knowing this should have taken better care of those people and give them human consideration, but had obviously accepted these people as slaves and therefore they are responsible for for the treatment, for mistreatment, more treatment, and they...we had uh asked for an

released from all charges.</sentence><sentence id="1369">Uh as a matter of fact there was one one case against him.</sentence><sentence id="1370">Then there was was appeal and when I was asked as a

the bombing of .</sentence><sentence id="1377">So he was uh uh...but obviously the the administration today thinks that this this is nothing burdensome for him, so they made him a judge, and a judge in the Auschwitz trial, so after I had given my evidence, and interesting enough the lawyer of that fellow didn't ask one question because as my lawyer said, he knew that he probably would have made it worse for his client, but the president, this this pilot ofthe Legion _, asked me, don't you have anything good to say about the about the man who is accused here, so after I had recovered a little bit from that question, I lashed out and I I really gave it...after all, I was at this time already an American citizen and I had the American press there also, so so I felt strong, and I told him...I

spiritual leader, but whatever...whatever he wrote after...it's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1534">When we took I remember, people told me when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and for the first time they asked him to speak to the people and there was an overcrowded <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and they thought he would talk about something about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1535">Not a word.</sentence><sentence id="1536">He talked about _, about Moses Mendelson (ph), about about whoever he wanted to, but not about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, because he doesn't...didn't want to be want to be to give even the appearance of a hero who is a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="1537">So may I say...may I close with with this remark...everybody is reacting to this chapter differently, and and and
