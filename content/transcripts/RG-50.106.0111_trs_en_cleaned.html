<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, [really couldn't support myself because I knew very little English, like please and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="71">My husband, who was a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in <span class="BUILDING">Casualty Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, and he got 50 dollars a month and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board.</sentence><sentence id="72">So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> where he paid 12 dollar a week.</sentence><sentence id="73">So that's -- because we could not -- the only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person.</sentence><sentence id="74">We had 24 dollars with us.</sentence><sentence id="75">So that th -- took a long time til we were able to -- even to move into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and s -- and use kitchen facilities.</sentence><sentence id="76">But you know, we -- it somehow, with this Holocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or different <span class="NPIP">places</span> will take care of us.</sentence><sentence id="77">So it was a very difficult time and my little girl and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Americanization school</span> to learn English.</sentence><sentence id="78">And we met a lot of other refugees and came through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with some of them.</sentence><sentence id="79">And little by little we got to know some of the physicians and we were in-invited a lot, and it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="80">If you don't -- if you don't -- can't reciprocate, you feel rather badly about.</sentence><sentence id="81">And we came to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor's wife said, oh, go up the <span class="DLF">steps</span>, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> you put your coat on, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> is there.</sentence><sentence id="82">So I looked at myself, I said, what's wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I look?</sentence><sentence id="83">But sh -- sh -- I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as you know where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> is, or where you can put your coat.</sentence><sentence id="84">Th-This is some</sentence><sentence id="86">of the things which are not done in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, or -- or in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in a certain class, you know, so -- so there were many, many things.</sentence><sentence id="87">It took a long time to be comfortable, to ask somebody.</sentence><sentence id="88">Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag.</sentence><sentence id="89">If you're finished with it, you don't it, give it to me.</sentence><sentence id="90">Or I go --I dr--I dro -- drove by, and -- some friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I s--and I --I said, Jean, I'm so hungry, what do you have in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span>?</sentence><sentence id="91">But I had a Visa, I could si-- and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but it -- it -- it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something.</sentence><sentence id="92">But when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask.</sentence><sentence id="93">We went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to try to get sponsors for some family in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it was in August, in September, it was very, very hot.</sentence><sentence id="94">And when we walked into somebody's and they offered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you.</sentence><sentence id="95">We didn't even want to accept a glass of water, we felt so -- s-so bad about ourself that we couldn't [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="96">So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits.</sentence><sentence id="97">They didn't even know the family, or they didn't -- they had the s-same name or something, you know, and -- and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the very poor Jews in -- the poorer class, you know.</sentence><sentence id="98">Of course, they had to have a certain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to -- to support or -- or help -- help the people.</sentence><sentence id="99">So it was a very di-difficult time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Did somebody help you and your husband and child come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Not really, because my husband was registered at the -- at -- at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> as a student to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his professor.</sentence><sentence id="139">So he was on the -- well, we had, or my husband had family here in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">But we -- we had a certain pride, you know, and just to take or ask me for something, it's very difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: When you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, did people ask you about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="147">The pi -- the peop -- some knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from -- from visiting there or from movies and so on.</sentence><sentence id="148">People were not so -- so interested in -- in what had happened, and a -- it was very little known, you know.</sentence><sentence id="149">Even we didn't know too much about.</sentence><sentence id="150">We were very fortunate to leave -- Hitler marched in on the 13" of March, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know.</sentence><sentence id="151">So -- but my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences.</sentence><sentence id="152">He could not treat Jewish people at all, or -- or in -- not -- he couldn't, not Jewish, Gentile people, but Jewish people he could treat.</sentence><sentence id="153">And he would get phone calls from the family that the husband was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">On -- on the following week she received a -- at -- not a fa -- didn't have faxes that time, a telegram that her husband had died on pneumonia and they have -- she would get the ashes back.</sentence><sentence id="155">So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was very difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me.</sentence><sentence id="156">You know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that</sentence><sentence id="158">you did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and -- here, and I was able, you know, the education that I -- that I have to make a success, and so did my husband here, and here my family and -- and friends lost their -- their life, and -- and so I--I felt very, very guilty.</sentence><sentence id="159">But now, since that -- it has changed my attitude since that interview and also I did not realize that I -- that | am considered a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="160">I didn't -- never, never occurred to me to be in the same category.</sentence><sentence id="161">But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I'm very fortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I was doing so much in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="162">I got the gold medal for my work in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">I got [indecipherable] what do you call it, gold medal from the -- from the embas -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">I got my citizenship back, and I have a voice.</sentence><sentence id="165">Being angry, it -- it does not help.</sentence><sentence id="166">So I feel now that since the -- all my writing, I have written about 18 -- not -- not high class and not people who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people that I worked in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> to write and be able to vo -- to vote.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: I'm going to ask you to pause because you're running a little bit ahead of me.</sentence><sentence id="190">I-- I would like you to tell me how you began your professional career, and I'd like you to explain about your background with <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I-I would like you to take your time and do that very slowly, from the beginning, please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Well, w-w -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, you know, after the first World War, we began to ask ourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done?</sentence><sentence id="200">And we were young people and so we wanted to change the world.</sentence><sentence id="201">So Montessori was brought, she was a physician from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and she brought the Montessori method to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">So we all ran to these lectures and got a -- a book that sh -- the first book she wrote and so on.</sentence><sentence id="203">And you had, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten teacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">So I took the -- the training, then when I got married, I opened up a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, and I -- cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children.</sentence><sentence id="205">I did not have the poor -- the poor ones as I really had here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">So na -- when I first came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests that were necessary to establish myself.</sentence><sentence id="207">And at that time was the English word against the English [indecipherable] that's what the -- some of -- of the newcomers have to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political active or -- or -- or -- or have a job and [indecipherable] thing.</sentence><sentence id="208">So first I got different jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh -- the special education was on the lower bottom of the education.</sentence><sentence id="209">So -- so when I applied they were happy to -- to get me to take care of the special class children.</sentence><sentence id="210">And then they were very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori.</sentence><sentence id="211">I made a lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used</sentence><sentence id="213">to bring teachers or students to observe in my -- in my classes and so on, to see what I'm doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Can you explain what is different about the Montessori program that you were initiating, as opposed to what was going on in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: For one thing, I did not initiate.</sentence><sentence id="233"><span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> was here in the early -- 1913 she wa -- she was here, and there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and by 1918 when the war -- when the first World War start, these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were all closed.</sentence><sentence id="234">Montessori approach is entirely different, it's very difficult to explain on -- on a few minutes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: If you could just give a little bit of an idea for someone who does not know about Montessori.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="241">For one thing, it's a different layout of a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">Children are -- are not expected because they're six years old that they be reading, or three years old.</sentence><sentence id="243">We don't -- we -- ina <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> we have children from three to six, for instance, because a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but unable to kick a ball or something than a six year one.</sentence><sentence id="244">So they're -- it's a such -- like ina family.</sentence><sentence id="245">We do a different classroom arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="246">So we don't have this is the class two years old, or four year one, we have them -- we have now infants" classes too, you know.</sentence><sentence id="247">So this is one of the things.</sentence><sentence id="248">And also that th-there are certain rules and -- and regulations in a <span class="BUILDING">Montessori classroom</span> and people in th -- it has to work like a -- like a society.</sentence><sentence id="249">You can -- I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how</sentence><sentence id="251">to open a <span class="DLF">door</span> and close a <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">How to lift a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and put it down.</sentence><sentence id="253">And how -- and if you play with something, that y -- I cannot come and say, this I want to play now with it.</sentence><sentence id="254">So, he learns that he has to ask.</sentence><sentence id="255">We have little rugs for the children, and they put their toys on that rug, and this is his <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">So they have to learn territorial rights.</sentence><sentence id="257">It's laid out the way, like a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> with the books and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="258">You just can't take out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book.</sentence><sentence id="259">We have to return it to there, and th-th-then next child can.</sentence><sentence id="260">So that the -- he learns in -- the way a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and the way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society.</sentence><sentence id="261">So, th-this is a very im -- important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to -- to understand that, you know?</sentence><sentence id="262">And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a directress, she directs activities.</sentence><sentence id="263">She doesn't sit at her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and the children come in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, greet the children.</sentence><sentence id="264">And as she greets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice.</sentence><sentence id="265">Oh, and you have such a doll.</sentence><sentence id="266">And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought me that doll.</sentence><sentence id="267">So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>, show the doll to her.</sentence><sentence id="268">She doesn't want to disturb.</sentence><sentence id="269">And then there comes Jim, and Jim is so sad.</sentence><sentence id="270">So he said, you know, teach -- some didn't know, you know, very much.</sentence><sentence id="271">He said, you know, the police came and -- and took my ha -- my father to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with it.</sentence><sentence id="273">And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he's gonna run</sentence><sentence id="275">around, disturbing and knocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things over.</sentence><sentence id="276">He -- somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help him, hold his hand, take him around and so on.</sentence><sentence id="277">So that <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> said like a hostess.</sentence><sentence id="278">If she greets the people at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a lovely dress today, and -- and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go and get yourself a drink.</sentence><sentence id="279">You don't talk to her the rest of your party, but she will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had, you know.</sentence><sentence id="280">So the same way children know they -- they were recognized, and that you knew dealing with their problems or -- and also, this teaches sort of manners to the children, to greet people in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="281">Some people talking -- were critical when I talked at one of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, I had some black students, teachers.</sentence><sentence id="282">And he said, oh yes, you come from a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, ki-kings and queens and you shake hands and you do all these nice things.</sentence><sentence id="283">But it's a-- a very important thing to be nice, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="284">And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life.</sentence><sentence id="285">And under that comes also the manners and behavior.</sentence><sentence id="286">And what is father of the cons -- of the -- the president, the first president, we had?</sentence><sentence id="287">George Washington.</sentence><sentence id="288">When he was 15 years old, he wrote a book on manners that is -- can be had.</sentence><sentence id="289">Now, we have -- "The Washington Post" has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on manners, the ya -- and once I said, like lubrication of your wheels.</sentence><sentence id="290">At that time very</sentence><sentence id="292">few people have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="293">But so she had a different -- so these are some of the things that were -- we were teaching.</sentence><sentence id="294">It's very difficult to do it, and you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: Thank you for -- for sharing that.</sentence><sentence id="354">When you first were working and -- and showing people the Montessori method, what difficulties did you have explaining or trying to initiate or introduce the Americans that you were meeting to this new way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: The first time when I was called to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: When was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
