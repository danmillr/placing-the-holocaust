<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: It was early 1990.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Or early 1990.</sentence><sentence id="8">We'll provide that date shortly, matter of fact -- the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.</sentence><sentence id="9">This is tape number one, side A. Okay, so, now we start and we know who we're sitting with.</sentence><sentence id="10">So, I guess there's -- there's some things probably, that have occurred to you since then, that you might want to -- to explore, and I want to invite you to take the opportunity, during the context of what we're talking about, or the chronology, or if there's things that just come up along the way that you want to discuss, we can do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="16">Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: And I first of all want to thank you for taking the time to sit and talk.</sentence><sentence id="20">And I know that -- that some of these memories are painful, and -- and I respect your journey, and appreciate you sitting and talking with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="26">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: I guess I wanted to first ask if you could maybe take us back and -- and to the extent that you can return us to a child's memory, and through a child's eyes, and in a child's heart, remember the feelings that you had when you were leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> an-and traveling through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">As I recall from the interview that you did, that you were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and, remember at all what you were thinking during that time, what was going through your mind?</sentence><sentence id="31">I know that you were very young, so a lot of it was probably a blur now, but remember what was going on in your mind and your heart?</sentence><sentence id="32">What were you thinking about, what were you concerned about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: I don't really remember an awful lot.</sentence><sentence id="38">I -- I think I often felt -- I guess you could call it a sense of confusion, by things that were going on, for example, as I mentioned in the -- in the video interview 10 years ago, it was strange things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="39">For example, I was told never to lie, and then all of a sudden, I'm told to lie to the German soldiers, and -- and make believe that I can't understand German, or speak German, when that was my obvious, fluent, first language.</sentence><sentence id="40">I -- I think I remember being, I don't know whether disturbed is exactly the right word, but for example, the -- the crowded, awful conditions on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">I mean, I remember that quite clearly, so many people crowded into a such a -- a little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, and -- and crowded in, not the way we had been crowded in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">living quarter</span>, even when we were living, you know, 30 females in this -- in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but crowded in a chaotic way.</sentence><sentence id="42">All these people, with these -- all these packages and I seem to remember it was night time and I guess it -- I guess maybe it was a little scary at times.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="46">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 4 And so I -- I remember a feeling of apprehension often, but other than that, I don't -- you know, I remember -- my memories of that time are very much -- I was trying to explain this to people, they're like still photographs that somebody just snapped, along the path of my life.</sentence><sentence id="47">As opposed to my brother, who's much older, and who really sort of remembers them like a videotape.</sentence><sentence id="48">I mean, you know, this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened.</sentence><sentence id="49">And for me, it's a bunch of stills that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: -- that capture either very significant times -- significant to me, as a little kid, because there was some traumatic thing happening, or some trivial thing happening that captured my imagination.</sentence><sentence id="52">So I don't remember -- as a matter of fact, throughout my life, I've tried to retrace that journey and just -- there -- there were only two <span class="NPIP">places</span> left to go last year, and so, actually in October, my husband and I went on a bicycle trip to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>, because that was the next to the last <span class="NPIP">place</span>, of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that I had been, that I had not revisited.</sentence><sentence id="53">And as -- as I said 10 years ago in the interview, I -- I always think when I do one of these things, that maybe I'1l come across something that will sort of stir something in my brain, enough to make me remember what happened here.</sentence><sentence id="54">And so, as we were walking through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, I mean, we built about -- I think it was about four days into staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, before the bicycle trip began, just because I wanted to explore, and see if I could remember anything, but absolutely nothing struck a bell, that I could tell, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">And we -- I -- we were apparently there for about two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="56">So there's one -- there's one more <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">We -- We did stop very briefly in two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in</sentence><sentence id="59">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 5 <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, and I -- I'd still like to go to those <span class="NPIP">places</span>, one of them is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">But I -- I think I've kind of run through the gamut of things that are going to jog my -- my brain, and -- and now, especially because I'm getting older and -- and at least short term memory is -- is getting worse, I think -- well, you know, I mean, the -- the ta -- unless -- unless I get Alzheimer's and -- and, you know, and suddenly things pop out of what I call my little black box, I think whatever I've remembered, is what I'm going to remember, and -- and nothing else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: When you talk about snapshots, I mean, are -- are there particular -- I guess it comes to mind this sort of images frozen in time, in a sense, in -- in your memory.</sentence><sentence id="74">Are there particularly memorable images like that, from that journey that -- that -- that you recall?</sentence><sentence id="75">I mean, that -- that perhaps you -- you didn't talk about it er -- in the earlier interview?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: You mean from the journey through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Only that scene of all that chaos on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">Other than that, I don't remember anything.</sentence><sentence id="85">I mean, I have -- I have an image which is not mine, that my brother has told many times, of -- of switching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> at the -- at the Spanish - Portuguese border, and going from this incredibly messy, chaotic situation, and in -- and having been really quite hungry for the last year and a half, coming into this very nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, with this -- my bro -- when my brother tells the story, his eyes just light up about the, you know, the sudden smell of fresh rolls and -- but -- but that's not my own memory, I mean, I've just heard him tell that so often that I almost feel as though I -- I remember it, but I -- I don't, really.</sentence><sentence id="88">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 6 I do remember, actually, when we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">I remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> set for meals in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and -- and I think -- I think I remember having dinner the first night, or some meal the first night, and then the rest of the time, we were horrendously seasick and we'd -- I don't think we essentially ate anything else for the rest of the journey, as far as I can remember.</sentence><sentence id="90">I just -- I remember -- I remember feeling awful, and barfing and -- but that's all I remember, until -- until we actually got to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, and then I remember that -- that awful time of having this medical check, which I -- which I mentioned in the -- in the video.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Just -- Yeah, everybody sitting there with thermometers in their mouth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Right, right, right.</sentence><sentence id="102">Thermometers that I had never seen the likes of before, and feeling -- [remember feeling a sort of halfway between being frightened and being puzzled about, you know, why were they doing this and were they going to make us go back?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: D-Do you -- Do you think that you had a sense at that time, or do you remember an emotion at that time, about why you were doing this, why you were going?</sentence><sentence id="106">Do you -- Was it -- Was it conscious for a little girl that -- you were what, four and a half at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Well, I was seven by the time we got here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Oh, oh, course.</sentence><sentence id="112">Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: I don't think I really understood what was happening, but I knew there was a reason to be afraid.</sentence><sentence id="116">I sort of knew that there were people who were chasing us and wanted to do bad things, and I knew that -- I sort of had a sense that if we could come here, that things</sentence><sentence id="118">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 a were going to be better or okay or -- or something.</sentence><sentence id="119">That this was sort of a goal, of getting away from this bad scene.</sentence><sentence id="120">And so, that day when we were having these medical checkups, I don't know how I knew this, I mean, maybe my mother had said some things, or maybe I heard other passengers, but I n -- I think I was aware that if there was something wrong with you, that you could be sent back.</sentence><sentence id="121">But other than that, I don't remember anything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: So when you -- well then, you've -- you've told this a little bit, so I won't ask you to dwell on it, but what -- what are some of your most vivid memories, early memories, once you got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and -- and you stayed with the Klinghoffers, right, your -- your -- your cousins?</sentence><sentence id="131">What are the things that -- that stick out most from those early days, whether it's staying with them, or other kinds of adjustments that you had to make during that -- during the time which -- which would have been what, in deg41 now we're talking about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: We got here on November 10", 1941.</sentence><sentence id="135">I guess in a lot of ways, I mean, I had learned by then to be very malleable.</sentence><sentence id="136">I mean, you know, I got thrown -- I mean, I remem -- for example, I'm a really fantastic sleeper.</sentence><sentence id="137">I ca -- I mean when I -- 99 percent of the time, when I go to sleep, I'm asleep before my head hits the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, practically.</sentence><sentence id="138">And, until the children were born, there would be nothing, other than the telephone, that could wake me up, and I'm still a really fantastically good sleeper, and sometimes people ask about that, and I say, well, I think that had to do, first of all because when I was little, and I had a -- a governess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, apparently she let me cry myself to sleep, so I re -- I must have</sentence><sentence id="140">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 8 learned that there was no recourse when you had to go to sleep, than to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="141">But I think the other reason is that, over those next few years, I mean, I slept in so many bizarre situations, I mean like, sleeping one night on this scale in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">And I just kind of learned that, you know, when it's time to sleep, you just, regardless of what happens, you sleep.</sentence><sentence id="143">And I remember, I had a one hour commute to go to <span class="BUILDING">Barnard College</span>, cause we lived in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, and I -- I think I actually sometimes could fall asleep standing up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span>, holding on to the strap.</sentence><sentence id="144">And now, I mean, just the last few days, I've actually been posing -- our son is an artist and I've been posing for him, and I -- I find that that's really hard work.</sentence><sentence id="145">But I find that sometimes I'm standing there, and I actually have dozed off standing up, while I'm, you know, clamped into a particular <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Mom, it's time to cha -- Mom.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="163">So, I think I just learned to be very malleable, and so when I got to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> and I met the guy who's now my husband, and I went on some camping trips for the first time, I -- I mean, I had never experienced that and so we -- a group of us went and we just had these zero pound sleeping bags and rolled them out on a rock and so -- all right, so the group said, "All right, we're going -- going to sleep now."</sentence><sentence id="164">So I just laid down on this rock and fell asleep.</sentence><sentence id="165">And my husband, who was supposed to be the experienced camper, you know, every three minutes -- he was lying next to me and waking me up and, "Sh, what's that?"</sentence><sentence id="166">You know, "What's that noise?"</sentence><sentence id="167">Or -- Or, "Boy this rock is hard," or something like -- and it -- I mean, those things just really -- when we</sentence><sentence id="169">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 9 -- during the Kennedy elections, we didn't have a television, and I was at a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I think this is an apocryphal story, but he claims that I fell asleep while we were watching television and that he accidentally stepped on me and I didn't wake up.</sentence><sentence id="170">So -- So I think I just have this -- I mean, I'm not -- there are a lot of ways in which I'm not flexible, but in terms of physical surround, I think because of what happened, I'm -- I'm very flexible.</sentence><sentence id="171">I mean, my husband needs a certain kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> before he can fall asleep, you know, and a certain surround.</sentence><sentence id="172">And other people I've been with, have to kind of do certain things, and get themselves ready for sleeping and so on.</sentence><sentence id="173">And I just -- that's just not requirement for me, you know, whatever is there, I don't -- I don't have -- "ma picky eater in one way, but I don't mind not eating and so -- so I'm -- I've -- I think because of those years, I'm just very malleable in terms of, you know, those physical things and -- and -- and needs.</sentence><sentence id="174">I think I've strayed now, from what you asked me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: No, but I -- Actually that's -- it's interesting, the whole notion of malleability in some parts of your life, but not others.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: I mean, and -- and -- and you -- you were saying, if I'm understanding you right, that that's a part of what yo -- how you learned to adapt to circumstances when you were very young, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="196">So -- So anyway, okay, now I've regained the thread of what you asked, so okay, so I got to my aunt's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my Aunt Lena ha-had one of her kids move out of this -- what I remember being a really tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and my mother and my brother and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="199"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0043 10 I got to live in there for about three months.</sentence><sentence id="200">And so, you know that was all right, I mean, I'd done that kind of thing before and as I'm -- as I said on the video interview, I mean, people thought that we would just kind of gobble up anything that was offered to us to eat, and I -- I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="201">I mean, a lot of things that people presented to me were awful, and I mean, one of the things that -- that I came to realize in that time is that adults do really bizarre things to children, you know.</sentence><sentence id="202">I mean -- And I'm -- I'm aware of this still now, as an adult, and I think this very much colored the way we raised our children.</sentence><sentence id="203">But, for example, I -- they would put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swing</span>, they would take me to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swing</span>, and I would say, "Please don't do that."</sentence><sentence id="204">But they would insist and they would put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swing</span> and start swinging me, and I would barf.</sentence><sentence id="205">And I knew I was going to barf, cause I knew that I couldn't -- I -- I was just so subject to motion of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="206">But they would just insist.</sentence><sentence id="207">And then my -- my Aunt Lena's brother owned what was called a luncheonette in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and so when I visited him, which was not terribly often, but -- but more so in the early days, he thought he was doing me this big favor, and he would present me with, you know, a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sundae</span>, with lots of whipped cream.</sentence><sentence id="208">Well, here's a little kid, age seven, who has had almost nothing to eat for a year and a half, and he would insist that I eat this.</sentence><sentence id="209">Well, you know, putting whipped cream, which is like a lot of fat, into a little kid's system, who hasn't eaten anything for a year and a half, just doesn't work out very well.</sentence><sentence id="210">And adults don't listen.</sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, you try to say, "Excuse me, but I -- I really would not like to eat this."</sentence><sentence id="212">Total, you know, ignoring o-of that.</sentence><sentence id="213">I've --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: And what were the consequences of that?</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="218"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0043 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Lused to feel really sick after a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sundae</span>, or even in -- even later, my -- after -- I mean, many years later, my cousin Dorothy, who was the youngest daughter of my Aunt Lena, married a doctor and they had kids, and I would sometimes baby-sit for them, or I would just go and visit, and I would often eat dinner there.</sentence><sentence id="220">And I've never been much of a meat eater, and I'm getting worse as the years go by, but first of all, ma -- when my mother made meat, she salted it and then she always cooked it extremely well done, so it was always very brown looking.</sentence><sentence id="221">And I would eat that, and I guess I sort of enjoyed some of those dishes at the time.</sentence><sentence id="222">But at my cousin's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she would make this rare steak, you know, like a big, thick Filet Mignon kind of thing, and it looked as though it was still alive.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I would say, "I'd rather not eat that."</sentence><sentence id="224">And -- I mean, they just wouldn't take no for an answer, and my cousin, th-the doctor -- the husband, would say, "You are going to eat that," you know, and I would sit there, at her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, having dinner, with this tears streaming down my eyes, trying to force this bloody mess down my throat.</sentence><sentence id="225">I mean, I don't know -- you know, they were trying to be nice, but I think -- again, I just think people don't listen to what kids have to say, and so -- so there were some traumas like that, that -- that happened.</sentence><sentence id="226">But anyway, at -- at my Aunt Lena's, you know, life was okay.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">I -- She was not very insistent on that I eat things that I didn't like, and so we just kind of stayed there and I ate.</sentence><sentence id="228">I don't -- I have no recollection of how I kept myself busy during the day, during those three months, cause I wasn't in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="229">I remember being sort of -- very watchful of my cousin Dorothy.</sentence><sentence id="230">She was -- That was the youngest daughter, you know, who later married this doctor.</sentence><sentence id="231">She was very pretty and very -- She</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="235">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 12 wore nice clothes and I remember she had this really attractive -- as a matter of fact, I have a -- a picture of her, I think, in this hat with beaver trim, you know, big, broad -- and I kind of watched her a lot, and I think I really liked her.</sentence><sentence id="236">She was sort of my favorite cousin, in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="237">And then -- So we -- we kind of stayed there and my mother went around, trying to figure out what to do, and then we finally found this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and I think -- I think the rent was like 46 dollars a month at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="238">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, and that was kind of far away from where my aunt lived, in the lower east side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, but it was only two blocks away from another relative, so that cousin, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, whose name is Hilda Towderer, and who just had her 80" birthday, she -- I just got a letter from her about a week ago, I th -- I'm pretty sure now that it was to her <span class="BUILDING">parent's home</span>, and she, of course was living there, she was a kid, that we went the day my father died.</sentence><sentence id="239">And that's where my mother and father were supposed to meet again.</sentence><sentence id="240">So, I have occasional contact with her and in recent years, we've actually corresponded, you know, several times a year.</sentence><sentence id="241">So anyway, so -- so we moved and she already had a little boy, who unfortunately died of, I think, lymphoma, about, I don't know, 10 or 15 years ago, and then she had a set of twins.</sentence><sentence id="242">She had another child many years later, but I -- I never have even seen that other child.</sentence><sentence id="243">But anyway, so we had this other sort of relative, and -- and we set up in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, on the fourth floor of <span class="DLF">1092 President Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, wh-which I think stands out in my mind, because I don't -- I don't remember anything green on that <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">There was an empty <span class="DLF">lot</span>, there might have been a couple of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, but if they were, they were small and very few -- I</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="248">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 13 mean, it was really a kind of stark thing, and there was an armory across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and so the armory was like a solid <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> that went for most of the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">We used to use that to play ball against.</sentence><sentence id="250">And then at the end of the <span class="DLF">block</span>, there was a little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">But it was a very stark <span class="DLF">block</span> and it was -- it was probably largely Jewish, but it was -- it was quite mixed, also.</sentence><sentence id="252">I mean, you know, there was an Irish family and a this family and a that family and -- and there was Forbes, the black super and -- and there were --

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: Yes, bilingual in English, and so when my brother was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">door</span>, or some educated adult, I would say, "It is I," but when I was with my little friends, I learned to say, "It's me."</sentence><sentence id="668">And the funny thing was, and -- and I should have remembered that, and I -- I didn't recognize it, and I still find it a little difficult, but our daughter, who is now a graduate student in anthropology, somewhere along the way, learned to speak this English that I found it difficult to listen to.</sentence><sentence id="669">Like, Meg and me are going to the movies.</sentence><sentence id="670">But even as a very little kid, sh -- and also sh -- she learned it from her little friends, to use a lot of bad language.</sentence><sentence id="671">But, at a -- it -- this is interesting in terms of kids, at a very, very early age, just when she was getting into that stage, when my brother came to visit, she never said things like, Meg and me, and she never used any swear words.</sentence><sentence id="672">And so somehow, even though nothing was said, that I can recall, she picked up on this and now -- I mean, she writes very well, and she's very well spoken, and she is now 29 years old and she speaks very well, and if she were talking to you, she would never say, "Meg and me are going to the movies."</sentence><sentence id="673">But when she's with her friends, who are all now pretty well-educated people, she still says, "Meg and me are going to the movies."</sentence><sentence id="674">But in conversation with anybody else, she would never use that.</sentence><sentence id="675">So that's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="676">Q: Well -- Well, you know, I was wondering, those -- those couple of examples that -- from -- from when you were a kid, I mean, about difference, whether it's language, or --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="680">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 30 or these -- this girl saying, you know, that we're Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="681">I mean, they're both examples of difference, and one might be more, sort of steeped in -- in the difference of a European background, and one steeped in a religious difference of being Jewish -- being Jewish, so I'm just wondering how much you -- I mean it -- living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, probably you'd perceive it less than in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="682">Did you -- Did you have a sense of -- of a climate of anti-Semitism at all, or -- or were --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>

formative in helping my brother grow up.</sentence><sentence id="1287">I mean, my brother had already grown up very quickly, cause he had to do -- he spoke a little French.</sentence><sentence id="1288">My mother knew no French and I knew no French.</sentence><sentence id="1289">So he was -- I mean, once we got to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, he was in charge of all the official

going on?</sentence><sentence id="1292">So I -- I wasn't aware of -- of all that other stuff that went on.</sentence><sentence id="1293">And then, of course, in -- when we got here, and when my

me.</sentence><sentence id="1303">So, and -- and then -- I mean, he would close himself in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at 1092 President and

it was, once an hour, or whatever, he would come out and he would just come up behind me and stroke my hair, I had rather long hair.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I mean, not very long, but you know, sort of up to the middle of my back, and stroke my hair and ask me how I was doing, look down to see -- make sure I was doing something serious.</sentence><sentence id="1307">So, I was always aware of his presence.</sentence><sentence id="1308">And you know, it's funny, people say that when you grow up with parents who argue, that it's very troublesome, and I only had one parent, but I had this brother.</sentence><sentence id="1309">And, as I mentioned on the videotape, very often my brother would say one thing and my mother would say a different thing.</sentence><sentence id="1310">But it never troubled me, because I had somehow, at some very early stage, made up my mind that my mother was very emotional and that what she said came out of, sort of an emotional rationale, whereas what my brother said made a lot more sense and came out of the <span class="BUILDING">gray matter center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1311">And so, I was rarely troubled by this, because it was totally

Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="3563">And I said, "Well," you know, "there are a lot of WASP-y women out there who -- who do big important things."</sentence><sentence id="3564">And he said, "Well, yes, but they're not a lot and that actually, one of the things that</sentence><sentence id="3566">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0043 128 comes down to you, about being Jewish, is that there is, in the Jewish tradition, as in the Chinese tradition, there is a tradition of education.</sentence><sentence id="3567">And you -- you got a lot of that, and that's probably why you're sitting here today and we're talking about chemistry.</sentence><sentence id="3568">And, you know, probably, if you were reared in some other <span class="NPIP">religion</span>, unless you happened to come from a particular kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or something, you probably would never have gotten this educated."</sentence><sentence id="3569">I'm not sure to what extent that's true, but in just doing a little reading, and in the years that followed that, I guess I sort of became convinced that the likelihood of my getting a Ph.D., as -- especially as a woman, was probably increased because there was this tradition of things passed down through the ages.</sentence><sentence id="3570">You got to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you got to do well, you got to get A's, you know, and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3571">And so now, if somebody -- depending on who it is, I" usually just say, "Well, "m of Jewish background," or -- or something like that, or occasionally I" still say, "Well, I'm -- I'm just not a religious person."</sentence><sentence id="3572">However, something that feeds back into what we've been talking about all day, is h -- this <span

I'm ashamed of it, but because it scares me.</sentence><sentence id="3575">And I know that there are a lot of people out there, who for whatever bizarre reason, don't like Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3576">And as I've gone through life and looked around me, you know, and people keep pointing things out to me, I think, you know, it really is kind of bizarre, because <span

educational or inventing or something realm, it's almost always either a Jew, or a high class WASP.</sentence><sentence id="3580">I mean, there are obviously exceptions, you know, but -- so I think you know that -- it is funny -- it's funny that there is so much prejudice against the Jews, because actually, more or less, I think they've done good things.</sentence><sentence id="3581">And the other thing that somebody pointed out to me many years ago is -- although there's c-certainly been exceptions in recent years, is that there's -- until very recently, there is relatively very little violence in -- in Jewish families.</sentence><sentence id="3582">I mean there was a famous case, I don't know, 10 years ago, about some Jewish guy who murdered somebody or beat her up or -- or something, but I -- I think by and large -- and also, I don't -- I think, traditionally, Jews drink a lot of Manischewitz wine, but they don't get drunk.</sentence><sentence id="3583">So -- So, you know, why is everybody down on the Jews?</sentence><sentence id="3584">I -- I mean, I don't -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3585">But -- But I -- I mean, I'm no longer -- but I'm not -- I'm

that's very important to me.</sentence><sentence id="3589">I mean, like one night, my husband and I were at</sentence><sentence id="3591"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0043

something.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And I'm kicking, "Shut up," you know, "he doesn't have to know."</sentence><sentence id="3595">And, so Sam didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="3596">But, you know, I don't know whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing.</sentence><sentence id="3597">I mean, could I have educated that person on that day, by saying, "Well, you know,
