<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: And where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: That was a very famous <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>, one of the most famous <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend is said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his <span class="BUILDING">high school gymnasium</span>, yes, called Kurt Hahn.</sentence><sentence id="199">And Kurt Hahn is a fascinating character in his own right.</sentence><sentence id="200">Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor.</sentence><sentence id="201">And after the first World War, in the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of the prince, he founded a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, on the English model, on the English model, which became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> si -- it's difficult to say.</sentence><sentence id="202">It became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> -- it's -- I mean, it's not difficult to say, it's just I have to find the right words.</sentence><sentence id="203">It became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for the aristocracy, yes.</sentence><sentence id="204">For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="205">The queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I used to dunk her pigtails into ink.</sentence><sentence id="207">I mean, the late queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="208">Didn't like her very much as a child.</sentence><sentence id="209">And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor.</sentence><sentence id="210">But it's typical of the atmosphere of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that the free places, or scholarship places were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="211">Or people, officers who'd fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes.</sentence><sentence id="212">I think that was very typical, though the plus of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was that it was one of a very few, I think the only <span class="BUILDING">German boarding school</span> that was co- educational.</sentence><sentence id="213">And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes.</sentence><sentence id="214">But otherwise, it's very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes.</sentence><sentence id="215">And I don't think the teaching was very good, I don't think you learned a lot, but your character was built.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Did you like <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Yes, I liked <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because I'm a bully by nature, and did very well. "</sentence><sentence id="238">Cause in these <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span>, if you're not a bully by nature, you don't do very well.</sentence><sentence id="239">I did very well indeed in the two <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> I went to, "cause eventually I went to an <span class="BUILDING">English boarding school</span>, of course, when Hitler came in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Explain to me what you mean by if you're not a bully you don't do very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Ifyou're not a bully you don't do very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: What does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Well, if your s -- boys together in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, yes, I mean, there's a lot of bullying, you know, after all, yes?</sentence><sentence id="256">And it's children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal.</sentence><sentence id="257">But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn't exist in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="258">For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed "til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes?</sentence><sentence id="259">You know?</sentence><sentence id="260">Have you cheated today, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="261">And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not.</sentence><sentence id="262">And nobody cheated.</sentence><sentence id="263">Was a privilege, nobody cheated.</sentence><sentence id="264">And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: -- It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn't have occurred to anybody to cheat.</sentence><sentence id="278">It was not done.</sentence><sentence id="279">The best way of putting it: it was simply not done.</sentence><sentence id="280">And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: George, growing up in -- in such a <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, with parents who are, in a real sense, public figures, what does that mean about who you meet, who comes into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, what was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: Well, you met interesting people.</sentence><sentence id="287">Of course I was much too young to notice interesting people, yes?</sentence><sentence id="288">I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">drawing room</span> downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes?</sentence><sentence id="289">And he had on a</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="296">what you call it, formal dress, yes?</sentence><sentence id="297">And I stood in front of him, I'm told, and pointed at him, to the great embarrassment of everybody, and said, "A Bolshevik?</sentence><sentence id="298">How come he's dressed that way?"</sentence><sentence id="299">Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not very apt at business, but who had great cultural interests, above all music, mostly musicians came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">Every Christmas -- you see, part of the daily rhythm was vacations in those days, and the vacations were normed.</sentence><sentence id="301">In other words, every winter we went skiing, regardless, every winter.</sentence><sentence id="302">Usually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Moritz</span>, yes, and later on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arosa</span>, but every winter we went skiing, and every summer we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">So, this was the rhythm.</sentence><sentence id="304">But the Christmases, for example, we always spent with a -- the most famous German conductor, I suppose, almost, of the century, called Fuertwangler.</sentence><sentence id="305">With the Fuertwanglers we spent the Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="306">He didn't behave very well after 1933, that's another story.</sentence><sentence id="307">But we spent Christmas at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fuertwanglers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">And there were always people from the musical world, and sometimes from the theater world, who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but I was too young, I wasn't allowed to be present, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
