<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: It occurred to me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span>, but it would have been part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living, rather than to explore his childhood.</sentence><sentence id="67">But I think it would be interesting to see where he grew up, but I don't know what remnants there are.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Do you remember -- not the book so much, but do you remember parts of stories that they told you when you were a youngster, when you go back -- not now, but -- but then, when you were maybe, I don't know, five or six or something?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a partisan fighter.</sentence><sentence id="79">He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined the Russian army, but that's the image I picture him, and he's told me heroic war stories and the like, and that's what comes to mind when I think of him.</sentence><sentence id="80">And my grandmother, she's told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture her as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="81">And that's the picture I get of her.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Were there some stories that affected you in a different way?</sentence><sentence id="86">That were very difficult for you to -- to hear, for some reason?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: A lot of the stories I was told, they inspired me and they made me proud of my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="88">One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who turned on him, and he's obviously still alive today.</sentence><sentence id="89">And he has the bullet wounds to show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened during the war, only much later, now.</sentence><sentence id="90">And I learned a lot more about them through my own reading, because I'm also very interested in the Holocaust, I've read more than several books over -- on the issue, I've seen movies, and through them I've gotten a more complete picture.</sentence><sentence id="91">I've visited, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Was that on your -- on your own initiative, or did you also learn about it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: [actually -- I -- | went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span>, and surprisingly they didn't teach very much about the Holocaust, I'm assuming because they took it for granted that people understood what it was.</sentence><sentence id="94">We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="95">We didn't have a very general history course.</sentence><sentence id="96">But I'm aware that a lot of my friends that have gone up through the system in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>, they -- they know -- they know about what the Holocaust is.</sentence><sentence id="97">They've learned about it.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Did you talk to your -- d-do you have a feeling that you knew more about -- in a sense because you knew your grandparents, or because -- or did already learn what you were taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, kind of?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="103">I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and about all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or than I was taught in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">And even in the books that I've read, because I have my grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I got firsthand feedback.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Did he ever -- did they ever, either your grandmother or your grandfather, come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Well -- to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="111">Not when I was there.</sentence><sentence id="112">They -- my grandfather, he is a speaker, he goes around and he constantly speaks at <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span>, <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">He came to my <span class="BUILDING">brother's school</span>, which was my old day school, but I was -- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore or junior.</sentence><sentence id="114">And he spoke briefly, and they put up a plaque.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Do you talk to some of your friends, or did you talk with -- to some of your friends about your grandparents and about your own thoughts on the Holocaust?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: I don't talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I'm not sure there's so much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that aspect, I think it's an atrocity.</sentence><sentence id="123">If I ever had a friend,</sentence><sentence id="125">which I haven't, but if someone made light of it, then I would.</sentence><sentence id="126">I do talk about my grandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they're just spectacular people.</sentence><sentence id="127">I used to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how they -- they have a very rich past, rich life.</sentence><sentence id="128">They're very impressive and I admire them for that, and I've bragged countless of times.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: Is that interesting to you?</sentence><sentence id="137">I mean, to your friends?</sentence><sentence id="138">Do they want to know about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Why didn't I tell them sad ones?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to, they were meant to be more entertaining.</sentence><sentence id="163">I was younger then.</sentence><sentence id="164">I don't think that it</sentence><sentence id="166">would have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Did it also feel sort of private because it was something that affected your grandparent's life very, very much?</sentence><sentence id="173">Do you feel like a little bit, protecting that <span class="NPIP">part</span>, or is that over interpreting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: I don't feel that, but there is actually -- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my mother's -- the family on my mom's side.</sentence><sentence id="177">That does come to mind, I have told people that, because -- cause of they're -- my father and my mother's side is disproportional.</sentence><sentence id="178">But did I -- I did not mention how it actually came to be and how -- Ime -- I know, of course, the history of how she hid up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and sh - - the rest of her family was down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, with the whole remainder of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">I -- I -- I mean, I never told them that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel that your -- your mother's experience with those -- with that -- with her parents was -- was -- and hearing the stories was a little different than your own?</sentence><sentence id="185">Did you -- is there sort of a difference that you see?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: In hearing the stories?</sentence><sentence id="189">I don't --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Well, in her response maybe, to them.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Do you mean by her upbringing, and how -- how --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="195">That you were maybe a little bit more removed from it, I mean, that you can sort of -- I don't know, I'm just fishing right now, to see whether -- you were listening, are you -- do you feel that you are listening to -- to your grandparents maybe in a slightly different way than your mother could?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: I don't know if I'm listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a very strong connection to them.</sentence><sentence id="197">But I'm positive they had a much more profound influence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in the other tapes.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I was just more removed from living with them, and they came up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my plate.</sentence><sentence id="199">But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly affected.</sentence><sentence id="200">I mean, she would -- never even would have considered to date someone that was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite I -- it greatly upset my mom, and even more so my grandparents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: What does it mean for you to be Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="207">What --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: To be Jewish is, for me it's my identity and for me it's more a part of me than a religious aspect, it's more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I would say that I'm Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="209">I don't keep kashrut and I don't pray three times a day.</sentence><sentence id="210">And I'm not absolutely the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218">most religious person I know.</sentence><sentence id="219">And yet I strongly identify myself as a Jew, and am very proud to be a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="220">And in that sense I feel that that's my connection.</sentence></p></dialogue>
