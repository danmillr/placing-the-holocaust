id="312">And then by their barking, attract the guards, help them finish the job.</sentence><sentence id="313">So, when we crossed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, for awhile, our luck was on our side.</sentence><sentence id="314">We knew where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was, we could just cross the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, but -- and there were <span

id="325">Well, we talked about it, and some guys were too weak to swim.</sentence><sentence id="326">And Mike and I could swim, which was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="327">And the <span

into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, which was of course, ice cold, and the dog got Mike in the leg, but we -- we want to strangle the dog.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="330">We decided the dog is not as -- he's ferocious, but makes a lot of noise, and their dogs -- we have here the police department, who will also attack somebody, but not for the throat, like these dogs were trained for us.</sentence><sentence id="331">And well, to make a long story short, it wasn't [indecipherable] the guy called off -- the guy in charge of -- I guess a group of 500, there were two whistle blows, and I think that meant recall, I don't know, I think it meant recall, because the dog immediately left us, and also ran back.</sentence><sentence id="332">We thought we were going to kill the dog and -- and -- because I know from doing this after the Holocaust, a dog that attacks you, even German Shepherd, and you get to the throat, and you get -- cut him off his <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1813">Q: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1815">A: Well, I was chosen from my battalion, wh-which was at a strength of about seven to 800 men, I was chosen the soldier of the month, that meant being a good soldier, and doing things right, and handling weapons all right, and going to study certain items, or things, that the army needed.</sentence><sentence id="1816">Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the</sentence><sentence id="1818">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 59 army, nothing special.</sentence><sentence id="1819">Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months, I got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month.</sentence><sentence id="1820">That meant having the honor of sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">colonel's office</span>, on Saturday morning when there was no training, and answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside the <span class="BUILDING">colonel's office</span>, with the adjutant, who was a captain.</sentence><sentence id="1821">At that time the colonel was reading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the headlines in the New York Times, which said <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a state, United Nations has voted to welcome <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or maybe so everybody could hear it in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, "Goddamn Jew politics."</sentence><sentence id="1822">Well, the adjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1823">He wasn't very much interested in the soldier of the month.</sentence><sentence id="1824">To him it was just another soldier answering telephone -- although I did get a certificate from him for that.</sentence><sentence id="1825">And he -- I -- I wasn't sure how I was going to respond to that, he didn't say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed something real loud in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I walked out, and I wasn't going to have the honor of sitting in this man's outer office.</sentence><sentence id="1826">The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was doing, and he knew that I'd understood what the colonel had said.</sentence><sentence id="1827">He was very embarrassed, and he asked me to please come back.</sentence><sentence id="1828">He didn't want to make a big issue out of this.</sentence><sentence id="1829">I said, "No, I just came here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I admire the freedoms we have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that."</sentence><sentence id="1830">So he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn't his opinion, and no -- he didn't think anybody else in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, just the colonel's opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1831">Well, I said I can understand,</sentence><sentence id="1833"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0065 60 everybody's entitled to his opinion, but not in a position like he is, make a blanket statement like that.</sentence><sentence id="1834">So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and in leaving him, he said, "Willner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of people make this world."</sentence><sentence id="1835">And I just remember that sometimes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1860">Q: Did you ever experience any -- did -- repercussions?</sentence><sentence id="1861">You were saying a little earlier that -- that the adjutant was concerned that you were going to be maybe demoted, or something, because you had left the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1864">A: I -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less.</sentence><sentence id="1865">I mean, I didn't -- I -- I -- I didn't think of that I'm afraid of being -- I don't think that could have happened to me, knowing already what I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody's pretty much the same, and people are people, there are good ones and bad ones.</sentence><sentence id="1866">There's always a rotten apple somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1867">But there also good apples on top.</sentence><sentence id="1868">So, it didn't bother me.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Particularly, I was very con -- not concerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it.</sentence><sentence id="1870">When I finished that basic training, was a battalion at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span>, my luck started.</sentence><sentence id="1871">The whole battalion was ordered to <span

German, or both, but what about <span class="REGION">Alaska</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1873">Besides it's very cold there.</sentence><sentence id="1874">So from my viewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to <span class="REGION">Alaska</span>, like everybody else, but again here's free speech, I can open my mouth and say I'm better fit for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1875">I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a</sentence><sentence id="1877"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0065 61 soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1878">Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that better.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And particularly I thought perhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk to me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable] with reason.</sentence><sentence id="1881">So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I'm -- I'm -- I'm not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a complaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this.</sentence><sentence id="1882">That -- that [indecipherable], as you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to <span class="REGION">Alaska</span>, and I feel that I'm wasting my time, and I'm wasting the army's time by just being a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1883">The only thing he has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if I'm in a position in -- in Europe someplace.</sentence><sentence id="1884">So the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at that time was all over Europe, except in the east.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And so, make the long story short, he didn't say yes or no, but he said, "You'll be notified."</sentence><sentence id="1886">I was n-notified the next day that I'm taken off the orders.</sentence><sentence id="1887">So that was the first day, it didn't say I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but then I went around, I was excited.</sentence><sentence id="1888">I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn't know, but then I came up on the sergeant who said, "Yeah, I've seen your name.</sentence><sentence id="1889">| think you're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1890">Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true.</sentence><sentence id="1891">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly Polish, or Czechs, in total about 10.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span>, the security people came on board, and they said, "You, you, and you, and you.</sentence><sentence id="1893">You remain here."</sentence><sentence id="1894">There was myself included, another guy from

id="1897">And what this was, they were hunting spies.</sentence><sentence id="1898">The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some of the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east, but were not refugees, they pretended to be.</sentence><sentence id="1899">They want to get into <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and spy for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1900">But they check everybody out then, including myself.</sentence><sentence id="1901">Anybody was fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1902">And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo -- among these 10 men, didn't have American citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="1903">The regulation at that time was that anybody who immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, who comes in, and is of draft age, will serve in the army first.</sentence><sentence

and say, "Under Hitler I was deprived of a German citizenship, I want it back."</sentence><sentence id="1907">I could have it.</sentence><sentence id="1908">I know somebody that did that here.</sentence><sentence id="1909">I have no interest in that.</sentence><sentence id="1910">They can keep their citizenship after all that.</sentence><sentence id="1911">So -- so we were held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmuk</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span

you may not do anything at all, because you're a coward, or you say this won't work, or -- anyway, so in the -- in these congressional investigations, like I said, I - - we had to go further than the

it, right in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, bury him.</sentence><sentence id="2542">So I said to this guy, "Do you have any unmarked <span class="DLF">graves</span> here, where you don't know whether they are Americans or German?"</sentence><sentence id="2543">He said yes, and that's the way we usually worked it.</sentence><sentence id="2544">If they said yes, if they were sometimes a

--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3971">Q: But the rest, it would be good to hear.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3972">A: But i-it's a long story, with a rabbi involved, and a general involved, and a -- the Germans, because of Communism, and because of Nazism too.</sentence><sentence id="3973">And also, not myself, I -- I wanted to make sure one thing, I'm not marrying to a big Nazi family, in respect to my parents, not that she would have had any guilt in this, her father, if he would have been a Nazi, but that would be a very odd thing.</sentence><sentence id="3974">But I did have a secretary, or a -- he was actually called in the army, a clerk, for -- he was a soldier, who could type up my classified stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3975">He was a Jewish guy, by the name of Ross Engle.</sentence><sentence id="3976">He was -- had a master's degree in political science, he was drafted.</sentence><sentence id="3977">Didn't have any desire to become an officer.</sentence><sentence id="3978">He would have made a good officer, but -- little guy like me, and he was going out with a German girl that I also knew, and I just talked to [indecipherable] in the <span class="BUILDING">finance office</span>, like a cashier, or something like that, <span class="BUILDING">military finance office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3979">And his case is interesting, it was just the opposite from mine.</sentence><sentence id="3980">He met this very nice, young girl, very lovely, and it turns out that she came from big Nazi family.</sentence><sentence id="3981">So big that it was a famous</sentence><sentence id="3983"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0065

party member.</sentence><sentence id="3985">And -- like the boy scouts, but they wore little knives, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="3986">I would have been one, I would have been Jewish, but -- the Hitler Youth.</sentence><sentence id="3987">That's what it -- what -- Hitler Youth Leader.</sentence><sentence id="3988">He was the Hitler Youth Leader of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3989">There were two during Hitler's reign, and he was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="3990">So the mother was the sister of this guy.</sentence><sentence id="3991">Well, that was during the war, and I figure well, after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished, that they don't keep their mouth shut, because they were Nazis, and anti-Semites, probably.</sentence><sentence id="3992">Well, you didn't have to be a Nazi to be an anti-Semite, necessarily.</sentence><sentence id="3993">You could have been Nazi, and have known some Jews that you liked, and still be a big Nazi, and -- and still like Jews secretly, or something.</sentence><sentence id="3994">But in his case it turned out, the poor guy, he was very smart -- like I said, he had a master's degree in political science.</sentence><sentence id="3995">He was only a company clerk, he was doing good work, and he -- he met this girl, and so it turned out her family's Nazi, and when he talked to me about this, he told me then that his father is a rabbi, and his grandfather was a rabbi, and here he was in -- marrying into a Nazi family.</sentence><sentence id="3996">H-He was in love with the girl.</sentence><sentence id="3997">Well, I said, "Well, I consider myself lucky, I also -- y- you know about my going out with Miss Dambotsios, and I found out from my wife only recently that he tried to date her too, one time, but she didn't want to go out with him.</sentence><sentence id="3998">And so, he came to my wedding, and he took all the pictures.</sentence><sentence id="3999">I have pictures of -- very nice guy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4028">Q: Do you want to go ahead and say something about your -- your wife, and -- and how that worked?</sentence></p></dialogue>

very much impressed with her ideas about Nazism, and how much she knew about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4035">Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn't have any Jews where she lived, in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="4036">All she did, she thinks one girl that she befriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn't sure, when she was a kid.</sentence><sentence id="4037">And so [indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the -- in the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn't want any bad elements to come into <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, girls who were prostitutes, or -- excuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something.</sentence><sentence id="4038">And so they tried to get the -- the army required two things .</sentence><sentence id="4039">In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer, your boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there's -- he had to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it.</sentence><sentence id="4040">In a case of an officer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only a performer thing.</sentence><sentence id="4041">I had the paper typed out, and I just said, "Would you please sign my permission to get married?"</sentence><sentence id="4042">Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let's say.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4043">And they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn't always true, had the common sense not to marry a prostitute, or -- but they did.</sentence><sentence id="4044">Some of the best looking girls were prostitutes there.</sentence><sentence id="4045">And they were [indecipherable] glad to get rid of them, send them to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4046">And there were guys who knew their wives were prostitute, and -- and still want to marry them.</sentence><sentence id="4047">But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of course signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no problem.</sentence><sentence id="4048">But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4051">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 137 chaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain signature on there.</sentence><sentence id="4052">If you're Jewish, you go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish chaplain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4053">That's the -- in the army they have chaplains who are catering - - catering wha -- providing the military with moral support, or religious support, who on Sundays have a mass, if they're Catholic, or they're Protestant, and on Friday night have a Jewish service in that <span class="BUILDING">army chapel</span>, which is -- in the army serves all faith.</sentence><sentence id="4054">So when the Jews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks from the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4055">In that time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> was about 200 people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4056">So we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="4057">So there is -- you never know what the chaplain, if he's Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative.</sentence><sentence id="4058">The army took them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn't have a job because every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don't have a congregation here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4059">And the army needed rabbis, and they went to [indecipherable] called the chaplain's board, or the chaplain -- they advised the army on who might make a good military chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="4060">And they only re-recommended Orthodox people, which was wrong, because the majority of Jews are not Orthodox in the United States of -- United States Army.</sentence><sentence id="4061">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> it's a different -- even there they're not -- they're not the majority.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4062">But the Orthodox chaplains are required not to s-say the prayers all in Hebrew, but to talk mainly English, and have the He-Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="4063">Whereas the -- the Reform rabbis have everything English, and I preferred that because w -- if I wanted to say a prayer or anything, I like to understand what I'm -- I could read Hebrew, but I didn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="4064">I studied for Bar Mitzvah, and never was.</sentence><sentence id="4065">Two weeks before my Bar Mitzvah, the war</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4069">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 138 started, in 1940, and I was not Bar Mitzvahed, so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew, and I knew the prayers, but I didn't understand it.</sentence><sentence id="4070">I was never much interested in it, but -- but when I did go to <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span>, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to understand it.</sentence><sentence id="4071">So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn't do what the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled, and they shugon, and they went through the motions like the Orthodox do, and I didn't do this at ho -- in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I didn't do this here, but [indecipherable] just went along, everybody chanted certain songs.</sentence><sentence id="4072">So, the one we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> that time was Orthodox, and I knew was going to face, going with my paper to have him sign it, he probably would say how about your wife converting before I sign the paper.</sentence><sentence id="4073">And exactly what happened.</sentence><sentence id="4074">But, before I went to the Jewish chaplain, I went to the cath -- no, to the Protestant chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="4075">There were three chaplains there, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4076">And the Protestant chaplain was the head chaplain, he had the highest rank.</sentence><sentence id="4077">He was a colonel, and the Jewish chaplain was a major.</sentence><sentence id="4078">And like I said, I was a lieutenant, so I was even lower.</sentence><sentence id="4079">They all had ranks.</sentence><sentence id="4080">I went to the chief chaplain, becau -- you see, it just said chaplain's signature, but what they meant was of your faith.</sentence><sentence id="4081">There wasn't -- we didn't have to do this, but I figure I'm going to get around this Orthodox chaplain, who is go -- not going to sign my paper, because he wants my wife to d -- to convert.</sentence><sentence id="4082">And I went to the Protestant chaplain, and he said, "Well," he said, "yes, I could sign your paper, but I have to respect the Jewish chaplain, he is [indecipherable] your faith here, and I would feel better if you get his signature."</sentence><sentence id="4083">And I said to the chaplain, "I tell you the truth,

let that happen, because although my wife probably would convert to marry me, but to me it doesn't mean a thing, and I don't approve of the Orthodox, I don't go around -- if we had a Reform rabbi, I would consider it, but we don't happen to have one."</sentence><sentence id="4089">And he said, "Try it anyway."</sentence><sentence id="4090">Okay, I went to see the Jewish chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="4091">I knew him already.</sentence><sentence id="4092">And he was a guy who was not -- not very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4093">He was very Yiddish, if you say, and from he -- like he ca -- he came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and he was telling me what to do, and that my wife or I should do this or that.</sentence><sentence

id="5860">I'm sorry, I have to drink some water first.</sentence><sentence id="5861">My voice is going out.</sentence><sentence id="5862">So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC, and he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular commission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three years, went to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one year.</sentence><sentence id="5863">Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies <span class="REGION">foreign areas</span>, they must know the language.</sentence><sentence id="5864">And then he didn't think that he should be just a soldier at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, he should be a combat soldier.</sentence><sentence id="5865">And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what happened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn't want my children to be in a position -- you don't know when it's -- could happen.</sentence><sentence id="5866">There are people who would -- don't like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have been criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep.</sentence><sentence id="5867">Well, nobody had a gun.</sentence><sentence id="5868">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> nobody owned a gun, my father didn't own one, although my uncle owned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very particular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time serving your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy.</sentence><sentence id="5869">And the army can be responsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders.</sentence><sentence id="5870">And Albert went in, and then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some -- somebody telling him, oh you're just a desk officer, he went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">attack helicopters</span>, and he was -- he was taught to fly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cobra attack helicopters</span>, which were very successful during</sentence><sentence id="5872">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 193 several wars.</sentence><sentence id="5873">And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit.</sentence><sentence id="5874">Then he got promoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the career today, must have a Master's degree in one <span class="DLF">field</span> or another.</sentence><sentence id="5875">So the army gave Albert 18 months to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Virginia</span>, and get a Master's degree within 18 months.</sentence><sentence id="5876">Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master's degree in foreign relations in nine months instead of 18 months.</sentence><sentence id="5877">So he -- one professor was Chinese, one of his three professors that he got close to.</sentence><sentence id="5878">He said, "Albert, you finished [indecipherable] what are you going to do now?" "</sentence><sentence id="5879">Well," he said, "go back to the army.</sentence><sentence id="5880">Take whatever job they give me." "</sentence><sentence id="5881">Well," he said, "you are Ph.D. material, you know that.</sentence><sentence id="5882">So," he said, "why don't you stay on and we'll be your sponsors."</sentence><sentence id="5883">But he had to make request to the army, and the army said -- no, first the professor wrote the army.</sentence><sentence id="5884">We have a young officer here, who finished in a -- in eight -- in -- in nine months, when most people have 18 months to finish it.</sentence><sentence id="5885">Can he stay here and go on to a Ph.D.?</sentence><sentence id="5886">Well nobody can finish a Ph.D. in nine months, they knew that.</sentence><sentence id="5887">So he was told then, if he studies on his own afterwards, they" 1l let him stay another nine months.</sentence><sentence id="5888">So he stayed another nine months at <span class="BUILDING">UVA</span>, and he didn't finish of course, but he studied very hard.</sentence><sentence id="5889">He was married already at that time, and his family left him alone at night when he was studying.</sentence><sentence id="5890">Well, make a -- he finished his Ph.D. in three years, and then the army send him to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>, like I said, and then he went again into hel-helicopters, and when he finished that job, he needed a job th -- for further promotion, he got that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for three years, and his -- then the next assignment was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5891">He was the war plants officer</sentence><sentence id="5893"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0065 194 for the

class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5895">That was the area of responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="5896">And he's now a lieutenant colonel, and two years ago he was interviewed for teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5897">And it's very difficult to get a <span class="BUILDING">professorship</span> there, and there are two ways.</sentence><sentence id="5898">You can stay just for two years, on a regular assign -- or you can be -- ask to make

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6031">Q: Wh-What about your other children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6033">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="6034">We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter.</sentence><sentence id="6035">Our oldest daughter was impressed by older son's beginnings in ROTC.</sentence><sentence id="6036">She didn't have ROTC when she started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> -- and by the way, I must explain about education.</sentence><sentence id="6037">I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that, coming from Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6038">German, and whether Jewish or not, most men were sh -- male chauvinists.</sentence><sentence id="6039">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> [indecipherable] start in having children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6040">Well very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in -- marriages sometimes don't last very long here.</sentence><sentence id="6041">The women have to have profession, too, so they can make their own living.</sentence><sentence id="6042">And I said, "Well, the money's not going to have me split three ways to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, it's going to be six ways from now on."</sentence><sentence id="6043">So how do I do that?</sentence><sentence id="6044">Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, because nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start.</sentence><sentence id="6045">So I said, "One thing Ill assure you of, the first year's assured, for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="6046">I -- I pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="6047">After that you're on your own."</sentence><sentence id="6048">So I want to put a taste in their mouths what <span class="BUILDING">college</span> is like, not to say I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6051">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 196 a year, and they make so much money, and they don't want to get a college degree.</sentence><sentence id="6052">You know, why should I go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, I can make more money not going?</sentence><sentence id="6053">So I didn't want that to happen, since I like -- like the education.</sentence><sentence id="6054">I picked some up in the army, picked up a degree in the army, but not like my oldest son.</sentence><sentence id="6055">Because my main interest was a family, not -- not studying.</sentence><sentence id="6056">So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I made sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later on will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, or from me, if -- if -- if nothing -- if you don't -- couldn't get the money, but you pay me back, because we have to get some money for your mother to be on her own someday.</sentence><sentence id="6057">I don't want her to be dependent on you.</sentence><sentence id="6058">| -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6059">So they all agreed.</sentence><sentence id="6060">And I said, "If you need any money at the end of your <span class="BUILDING">college</span> time, the fourth year, and the third year, and you can't get any loans because your dad makes too much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest.</sentence><sentence id="6061">And you pay me back when you can, when you start working."</sentence><sentence id="6062">And that's what happened every one of them.</sentence><sentence id="6063">The three last ones owed me each -- I don't know how much they owed me, but somewhere around 10,000 dollars each.</sentence><sentence id="6064">And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no interest.</sentence><sentence id="6065">If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month.</sentence><sentence id="6066">And if they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no interest.</sentence><sentence id="6067">I will let them off when I can afford to.</sentence><sentence id="6068">So as it turned out, the last three owed me about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good money with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="6072">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0065 197 and y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don't owe me any money any more.</sentence><sentence id="6073">Because I could afford, there was nobody else going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6074">So they all understood, and they all were helping, and they were -- and they continue to do so.</sentence><sentence id="6075">So we go to Nina.</sentence><sentence id="6076">Nina, or Nicole, who is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl.</sentence><sentence id="6077">After she saw her

the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not really, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander.</sentence><sentence id="6079">And she got also a commission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in uniform, to be at the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span>, or at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and pin the bars on my daughter.</sentence><sentence id="6080">And so one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was her brother, and the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on her.</sentence><sentence id="6081">So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411"

were not allowed to touch us, it was a very interesting experience.</sentence><sentence id="6086">But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her husband at the <span class="BUILDING">advanced
