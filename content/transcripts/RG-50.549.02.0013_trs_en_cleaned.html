<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is an interview with Regina Gelb, conducted by Regina Baier, on March 18th, 1998 in Mrs. Gelb's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">This is a follow-up interview to a USHMM videotaped interview conducted with Regina Gelb on September 30th, 1991.</sentence><sentence id="6">This is tape number one, side A. Let us begin with your name -- your birth name and your name now and also when you were born and where.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="12">Well, my name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, L-a-k-s. I am also known as Renia, R-e-n-i-a. So you could refer to me as Renia and Regina, but -- but for all practical -- for all official purposes, I really am Regina, so you can only find me under that, but everybody else knows me also as Renia.</sentence><sentence id="13">Gelb, obviously is my married name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: When you were born --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: Oh yes, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and I'll spell that for you because it's a very long name.</sentence><sentence id="19">S-t-a-r-a-c-h-o-w-i-c-e. That was, at the time of my birth, also known as Wierzbnik, W-i-e-1r-z-b-n-i-k. I was born on December 16, 1929.</sentence><sentence id="20">I just want to add that at time of my birth, I was really born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> was combined with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> into one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and now you would never probably -- you will not find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> on the map, but you will find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">So, I sort of refer to the fact that I</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="26">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 3 was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> because if you want to look me up, you will not find me otherwise, except in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: Whereabouts is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="31"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> is in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span>, about two and a half hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, directly south.</sentence><sentence id="32">It is an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> and it was -- if we go a li-little back in history, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, as you know, was divided up to 1918, between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">We were -- I was born in the very heart of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which was called in those days, Congress Poland, because when Napoleon went through <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, he carved up a piece of free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that was the -- the core of the -- the core -- the -- the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> is located.</sentence><sentence id="34">Now, th-the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, as I a-am fond of remembering -- reminding everybody -- the fact that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was an -- an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> played a great part in my surviving the war.</sentence><sentence id="35">The reason being that after the first war, when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became independent in 1918, the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of the Polish government -- it was decided that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> has to arm itself, so they carved up a -- an industrial complex within the heart of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they started -- there was ore to be smelted and big <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> went up.</sentence><sentence id="36">How this historic fact relates to my survival is probably a bit farfetched, but it isn't, for the reason that the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> di -- me -- the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which prior to the war, smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> and -- and meat grinders, from the big to the smallest, was converted to a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> as soon as the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="37">By virtue of which, the Germans decided that the entire <span class="REGION">area</span>, which contained these different <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, which</sentence><sentence id="39">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 4 were converted into <span class="BUILDING">munitions factories</span>, would need le -- slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="40">Therefore, people who were living within that <span class="REGION">area</span>, were first used as slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="41">Of course, in due time they would die out and they would be shipped, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="42">The numbers would always be supplemented by new people, who were either shipped out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or caught or whichever way.</sentence><sentence id="43">The number --eventually the number of slave labor people working for the -- in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, was constant, even though people were dying like flies.</sentence><sentence id="44">But of course we're -- are getting ahead of our story here, because this is only the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="45">I just meant to make the connection that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was -- before the war, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> proper.</sentence><sentence id="46">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> proper was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">That was basically a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where everything took place, commerce and so on and it was a very sizable Jewish community, about one third of the people living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="48">And they were generally, as they always were -- they were merchants and they were cobblers and carpenters and so on and they -- there also was such a thing as the Jewish intelligencia in those days.</sentence><sentence id="49">Of which my parents were part.</sentence><sentence id="50">But that was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> did not have Jews living in -- in it, because the Jews were not allowed to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, strange as it might seem.</sentence><sentence id="51">Before the war, the Jews were not allowed to live or work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">In -- and, as I said, eventually the two were combined so by then you couldn't do -- have these restrictions but that was the fact, before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: I just have one follow-up question on that story --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="83"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: -- before I would like to go to your -- your childhood and your family, actually.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: What were the reasons?</sentence><sentence id="88">Were they anti-Semitic reasons or were they different reasons?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: I could not tell you.</sentence><sentence id="92">You know, there are certain things which to this day remain a mystery to me, because I was a child.</sentence><sentence id="93">I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the fact -- in the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there.</sentence><sentence id="94">And I'll tell you, actually why -- I'll tell you, I -- I almost know now, because I've read some -- some books on the subjects about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> that were written actually the last 20 years.</sentence><sentence id="95"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> was at one time, built in colonies for people directly involved with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">In other words, after 1918, when that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> went up, they started building <span class="REGION">colonies</span>, one was called Roboneetcha, which is for the workers and another one was for the -- for the, I guess for the administration over there.</sentence><sentence id="97">But they had these <span class="REGION">colonies</span>, they were what you call now, you know in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, you have a lot of these developments.</sentence><sentence id="98">You know, you have <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and the -- the -- but the -- the basic commerce was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">The reason Jews did not live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, because to qualify, you had to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, you see?</sentence><sentence id="100">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="101">And that was true up to the very war.</sentence><sentence id="102">And when the war broke out, obviously things got totally changed because the resettlement of Jews came into being and all this, but this is a story that we'll probably continue later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: So maybe if you can tell us a little bit about your family now.</sentence><sentence id="116">About your early upbringing, your daily life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="121"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="123">Well, first of all, we were a family of five -- father, mother and the three of us.</sentence><sentence id="124">My oldest sister, Anna, who is also called Hanya.</sentence><sentence id="125">Her last name now is Wilson and she's a Canadian.</sentence><sentence id="126">My sec -- my middle sister, Krisha, who's also called Kris, but her true name is Rosalia Kristina Lehrman.</sentence><sentence id="127">And we call her Krisha for short.</sentence><sentence id="128">And my name, Regina, which also is Renia.</sentence><sentence id="129">We were a secular type of family.</sentence><sentence id="130">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very Jewish in the sense that it had a very sizable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orthodox Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">But my parents, of course were part of the Jewish community, but we were not Orthodox, we were not -- we were secular.</sentence><sentence id="132">And my parents were very much oriented to Zionism.</sentence><sentence id="133">But before we proceed that, let me just explain to you the other <span class="NPIP">background</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">The fact that we spoke Polish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we were brought up in the Polish language.</sentence><sentence id="135">Both my parents spoke Polish beautifully, even though my father's background was really German.</sentence><sentence id="136">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solsnoviets</span>, which is <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>, which -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salesia</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salesia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">And he was brought up in the German language, because obviously he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- he was an educated man -- he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> pri -- prior to the f -- end of the first war, prior to 1918, which means that, depending on which sphere of influence you lived in, that was the language in which you were taught.</sentence><sentence id="138">Well, my pa -- my father was a German, in that sense, because he -- he spoke German beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="139">To this day I talk about his encyclopedia because that played a big part in the war, also.</sentence><sentence id="140">He had his encyclopedia in German, he -- he was subscribing to magazines and other things and he spoke German beautifully, but of course his Polish was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="141">Mother, on the other ha -- hand, came from the so-called Russian part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so she spoke Russian in addition to her</sentence><sentence id="143"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 7 Polish.</sentence><sentence id="144">But we were brought up at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the Polish language.</sentence><sentence id="145">My parents knew Yiddish and spoke to each other only if they didn't want the kids to understand.</sentence><sentence id="146">Now my father was an engineer in the <span class="BUILDING">forestry business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">That was a very big business in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">They employed people who had good education, a good scientific, what's that to say?Science background, which my father had from his German education.</sentence><sentence id="149">Assessing forestry for lumber and such.</sentence><sentence id="150">And there was a big <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> -- belonged to Jewish people, I think they were Austrians.</sentence><sentence id="151">And they were -- that was their ownership.</sentence><sentence id="152">And they employed -- it -- it was a sizable type of operation because th-the lumber was -- the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> that were cut elsewhere, brought in, were -- were turned into lumber.</sentence><sentence id="153">And mother was -- as it was true in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, she was not what you call a working woman, not until 1938 or so and I -- P'll come to that.</sentence><sentence id="154">And we had a very good life.</sentence><sentence id="155">Of course we had a maid, as everybody else did and when I tell people how it was when -- we had a -- a seamstress come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you know and people used to buy goods and they used to sew it for you, the -- you know, the seamstress would come and she would sew the sheets and she would sew the skirts for the kids and the blouses and all that.</sentence><sentence id="156">And this was of course another totally other way of life.</sentence><sentence id="157">And then you had the <span class="BUILDING">laundress</span>, she came and she did the big laundry and -- and she took it to the mangle and I told somebody about the mangle and said, "What is that?"</sentence><sentence id="158">Well, the sheets were mangled.</sentence><sentence id="159">And there is such a thing and I know the machine.</sentence><sentence id="160">I could even describe it.</sentence><sentence id="161">But anyhow, we had a very good life, until the late 30's.</sentence><sentence id="162">We had a wonderful life, as you -- I'1l show you some pictures in my albums.</sentence><sentence id="163">My mother has arthri -- had arthritis, so</sentence><sentence id="165">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 8 she went for a cure to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busco</span> -- Busco's druey, which had <span class="INT_SPACE">sulfur baths</span> and she went regularly, ev -- every summer for six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="166">And after that, of course, we used to come -- she used to come back and we used to go so-called <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, somewhere in the -- on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to -- to recover.</sentence><sentence id="167">But sh -- this was a strenuous kind of treatment and she used to take us with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busco</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">Not all three at one time, but two, sometimes one and I remember -- I have even a picture from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busco</span> with my mother and my sister has a picture from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busco</span> that -- mother did that in the summertime, but other than that she was very involved with the Zionist movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">And she was instrumental in ope -- in opening a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarbud</span>, which was specifically designed for children like ourselves, who came from <span class="BUILDING">secular homes</span>, where Polish was spoken, for them to have the Jewish identity.</sentence><sentence id="170">We used to go after regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">After the Polish -- regular <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span>, we used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarbud</span>, it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarbud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarbud</span>, they taught us Hebrew and they taught us Jewish history and the Bible and such.</sentence><sentence id="173">But basically, we were too young to know Hebrew well enough to study the Bible, so that was in Polish and the language, to an extent to which a child could manage at that age.</sentence><sentence id="174">And mother was also very instrumental -- first of all, she was president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viso</span> the women's international Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="175">Whether she was president of -- of the <span class="REGION">area</span>, or whatever the <span class="REGION">area</span> encompassed, I couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="176">Whether it was a <span class="REGION">county</span>, or -- or <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> or <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> or -- I don't know, but she was president of Viso.</sentence><sentence id="177">And these wom-women Zionist movements supported very much the pioneering -- the preparation of young Jews for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">The pioneers for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And they used to be called <span class="BUILDING">Hag Sharah</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And Hag</sentence><sentence id="182">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 9 Sharah was the kind of a training center which was established even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> where these young fellows, that was mostly young men or very young women who were not married and had no children.</sentence><sentence id="183">Young people who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and be pioneers.</sentence><sentence id="184">And they were trained in farm work and in communal living and all that.</sentence><sentence id="185">And the women Zionist movement, of which my mother was president, not just -- didn't just support it, but was running that Hag Sharah.</sentence><sentence id="186">Father was also quite involved with it, but of course he had to earn a living.</sentence><sentence id="187">But mother, this was her full-time job.</sentence><sentence id="188">All this changed about 1938 because the Jewish people who owned the fac -- the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, sold it to Christians.</sentence><sentence id="189">And -- I think they were Austrian Jews, if I remember correctly.</sentence><sentence id="190">Anyhow, after they have given up the -- the operation -- the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span>, every single Jew was fired.</sentence><sentence id="191">From the top to the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="192">Whether he was an engineer or whether he was whatever.</sentence><sentence id="193">Pushed the tr -- the -- the -- the barrels or collected the -- whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="194">It was completely staffed by Polish Christians.</sentence><sentence id="195">And that was also the very hard time, there was lots of boycotting done of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> and Jewish enterprises.</sentence><sentence id="196">And of course, studying history, I know that this didn't come of itself, it was germane, but at the same time, the influences coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were also very much involved in this very open -- very open antagonism.</sentence><sentence id="197">You see, they wouldn't beat you, but they -- they, if you had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, they would march around and they would say -- they would march and they would yell, "Don't buy from Jews," and don't buy from Jews and such.</sentence><sentence id="198">Now, my father was without a job now -- yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="309">Well, we had a very wonderful life.</sentence><sentence id="310">That is not just in retrospect or nostalgic or in any way but to describe it, we really had a wonderful childhood.</sentence><sentence id="311">The parents were, as I told you, very progressive minded.</sentence><sentence id="312">And we were very, very close-knit, especially with my mother's side of the family, because they lived only within 20 miles or so of the -- or 20 kilometers, I don't know which, but very short distance from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">And personally, I never knew either grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="314">My father, as I told you, came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solsnoviets</span> and that's <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">I never knew that grandfather, he died before I was born.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I never knew my other grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="317">My mother's maiden name was Tannenblume, so I did not know my Tannenblume grandfather and I didn't know my Laks grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="318">However, I knew my grandmothers very well, both of them.</sentence><sentence id="319">The -- grandmother Laks used to come for -- you know like you, in the old days they used to come for a visit, was an extended visit, let's say for six weeks, so she lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="320">And then she would go to visit her other son, Alexander, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">And then she would make the rounds and then she would -- she lived in <span

trips.</sentence><sentence id="324">But that was the time when I saw her, but the other grandmother, we called Babcha, is a grandmother for -- in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="325">The other grandmother, I really -- not just adored, she had great influence over me and I remember her dearly and I'll never forget her because of my childhood, my orientation to the importance of things.</sentence><sentence id="326">For example, she was the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">I never tire of talking about it because she was -- she owned a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> with her two daughters.</sentence><sentence id="328">There were two daughters, unmarried daughters living with her.</sentence><sentence id="329">One of them was Regina, that's mother's sister, Regina Tannenblume and the other was Anja.</sentence><sentence id="330">Anja Tannenblume.</sentence><sentence id="331">Babcha was Sara Tannenblume.</sentence><sentence id="332">Babcha was officially, so to say, the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span> because it belonged to my grandfather, but the three of them -- actually the -- th-the daughters were running it.</sentence><sentence id="333">And I would be invited -- grandmother was fond of inviting one child at a time.</sentence><sentence id="334">She was

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="926">Q: When he said that, what did it mean to you?</sentence><sentence id="927">Did -- how did you interpret that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: L interpreted by the fact that he did not like Jews.</sentence><sentence id="931">He absolutely had it in him to -- to -- to belittle me.</sentence><sentence id="932">I mean, you know how it is in front of a class, to be -- I mean you are a seven, eight or nine year old child and somebody says something like this to you in front of

the Jewish girls.</sentence><sentence id="937">But that isn't what you call anti-Semitism in the true sense.</sentence><sentence id="938">This is just, well they're Jews, we don't have to bother with them and you can beat them up.</sentence><sentence id="939">So, however it was, I was afraid as a girl, of these Christian boys, but some of them were friendly and others us-used to beat us up coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so we used to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a group.</sentence><sentence id="940">But this was very specific, this calling me out in the class, very specific and even as a child, I could feel that he wanted to belittle me, that he wanted -- one way or another to belittle me in front of the class.</sentence><sentence id="941">You see?Because when I was beaten up by a Christian boy, that was just part of the way things were.</sentence><sentence id="942">You know, you beat up -- the boys were rambunctious and well

see?</sentence><sentence id="1183">Right away we were -- there was no food, they wouldn't allow us to buy food, we had to -- oh, no -- I -- lam really yet getting ahead of myself, because this is right after we came back.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And very soon -- this was a daily occurrence, that the Gestapo would come around with dogs, so you couldn't be <span

we're not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because this <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span>, you're not allowed -- it was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1195">We used

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1306">While we lived in that -- at that -- that stretch of time during the war, as I was saying before, we -- children, of course had to watch out because of the

more <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> before we ended up in the last one, which was our last <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, before the alseelung, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was cleared of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1310">What I meant to say is that that entire period -- that entire <span

and -- and feeling that there is this other world, with which we don't have for the time being, but eventually we'll still have it, type of attitude.</sentence><sentence id="1320">I also mentioned in the previous tape that some people decided that they would sign up for the work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, because the word got around that this might be a good thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="1321">My two sisters, very late -- I don't know whether it was -- could have been early 1942 or late in 1941, signed up -- they went and were signed up and they were -- they were sent to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, also in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, not in the major -- the <span class="BUILDING">munitions

when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was to be cleared -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was cleared in 1942, in October, my two sisters were on the night shift in that <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1324">They were not released, as none of the workers were allowed to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1325">They were kept back.</sentence><sentence id="1326">Whether it was the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, the workers were kept back, because meanwhile there was a round-up in what has now become -- is very small area of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, still not surrounded by wire or anything like the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that -- we know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1327">So that, by this time, there were only a few <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1368">A: A whip, yes -- with the whips.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And I -- I was used to the whips because whenever they marched by themselves, whenever

class="BUILDING">house</span> and the main square were the most horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="1377">That was the real brutal -- naked brutality, as I was forced to -- to -- to see en masse, the first time.</sentence><sentence id="1378">Because, you know, I saw shooting here and a shoot -- beating there and all kinds of things I did see, but I didn't see so many acts of brutality up to that

leave and the square where we had to line up, was one horrendous bloodbath.</sentence><sentence id="1387">The most brutal sight I have ever seen up to that point and of course, I've seen plenty.</sentence><sentence id="1388">I've seen all kinds of cruelty prior to that, but nothing in such concentrated form.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And we -- on the way we picked up -- my mother had to -- my mother didn't have to, we were walking, they were - - my parents were holding me by the hand and -- I was a skinny child.</sentence><sentence id="1390">My mother padded me up with all

was tall, so I could sort of make myself look older if I tried.</sentence><sentence id="1393">And on the way, mother noticed a friend of hers, an elderly lady, Miss -- Mrs. Kazimerzka, who couldn't move and so m-mother took her by the -- under the arm, like and my father took me by the hand and the four of us walked together to the square.</sentence><sentence id="1394">And of course when we came to the square, the acts of brutality has only -- had only in-intensified, because it was a real -- like a butchery.</sentence><sentence id="1395">You know, it was the killing and the kicking and the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1904">A: Yes, on the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1905">He saw us, we knew he saw us, because you know, we sort of communicated.</sentence><sentence id="1906">And -- you couldn't wave, obviously, but he saw us, because he was at the tail end of that group, that -- from which we were separated.</sentence><sentence id="1907">So he knew that the three of us were together and that was the last we saw him.</sentence><sentence id="1908">So, you see, my mother was -- my mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in October "42 and my father just lived two more years and -- if you call that life -- so he perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1914">Q: What -- what happened when you arrived there?</sentence><sentence id="1915">What -- what went forth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1918">A: Well, the first thing obviously was to be tattooed.</sentence><sentence id="1919">You know, they wouldn't let you anywhere without being tattooed.</sentence><sentence id="1920">So we decided that we were going to line up one next to the other, because we knew by then that, you know, numbers are in sequence and if you have numbers in sequence, you have a chance to -- to -- to be within that number -- group number.</sentence><sentence id="1921">So my oldest sister Hanya, Anna had the first num -- whatever the number was.</sentence><sentence id="1922">Kris, Krisha, the second, had the second number and I had the third.</sentence><sentence id="1923">So we had a sequence of numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1924">And it proved to be lifesaving because at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, as you know, there were no names any more, there were just numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1925">If they needed a contingent of people, they would call numbers, let say from 15 to 95.</sentence><sentence id="1926">You see?</sentence><sentence id="1927">So -- it so happens, whenever we were sent <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span>, we were called by that -- we were lucky enough -- of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1930">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 57 course sometimes you can be cut off at the num -- end of the number too, but it so happens that our numbers were always in that nu -- group number.</sentence><sentence id="1931">And after we were tattooed, we were told to disrobe and go into what was called <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1932">Nobody knew what that was and there was one <span class="DLF">chimney</span> going, you could see fire coming out.</sentence><sentence id="1933">One <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>, because by then, you know, this -- this is 1944, August and the war isn't going so well for the Germans, so I understand that they have destroyed some of the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">One was still belching fire when we came.</sentence><sentence id="1935">The smell was incredible, incredible.</sentence><sentence id="1936">And of course, at night, you could see the fire against the <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1937">And I don't know, I must have rationalized that fire somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1938">You know why?</sentence><sentence id="1939">Because in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, when they used to melt the ore -- smelt the ore, they used to -- my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> was sort of hilly.</sentence><sentence id="1940">They used to bring the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> with the hot s -- the leftover from the -- from the ve -- the ore that was smelted out of it.</sentence><sentence id="1941">The leftover was called jujer, lighting it's cauks or whatever it was called.</sentence><sentence id="1942">They used to pour it out from those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span>, over the -- over the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, so that you saw a -- like a long -- now what?</sentence><sentence id="1943">Like a belt, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1944">Pass, what is the word?</sentence><sentence id="1945">Just escaped me.</sentence><sentence id="1946">Anyhow, when you saw the -- the -- the -- this -- this -- this lava type of a fire pouring down and I knew this was just melting -- this was fire.</sentence><sentence id="1947">It looked like fire at night, you see, if you ever saw it.</sentence><sentence id="1948">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, maybe I -- I always thought of it.</sentence><sentence id="1949">Maybe I rationalized.</sentence><sentence id="1950">When I saw that flame going out of the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> -- they said to me, "You know they're burning people in there."</sentence><sentence id="1951">But I said to myself, "Maybe that's -- what is there is that what I saw as a child when I saw that flame in the dark.</sentence><sentence id="1952">The stuff that poured out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span>, you</sentence><sentence id="1954">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 58 know -- of the -- of the -- the byproduct of the smelting."</sentence><sentence id="1955">But of course was a big -- as they say a pipe dream, because this was the true burning flesh, which you could smell.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1956">You could almost touch it, that's how pervasive it was.</sentence><sentence id="1957">And we -- I don't know how much I knew, if anything, that the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the name or the -- the -- the whole -- what it was all about.</sentence><sentence id="1958">Except that now, having been shifted so many times, you know, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to another <span class="NPIP">holding place</span>, you know, this was just another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1959">And when we came in, we were held on what was called quarantine.</sentence><sentence id="1960">The situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was different too, you see, because by now, the -- some of the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> were -- were gone, but they were still burning and they were still eliminating people as fast as they could, but I don't know what the projection of time was with them, how they were going to do it all.</sentence><sentence id="1961">They put us on the -- what you -- what is called quarantine, which meant nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1962">It meant they give us wo-work to do that was meaningless.</sentence><sentence id="1963">There was a pile of rocks here on one end and there was a pile of rocks on the other end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1964">You had to -- very heavy -- you carried the rocks from this end to the e-end, to the other.</sentence><sentence id="1965">And then you went over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and carried them back.</sentence><sentence id="1966">In fact, in one of those rock carrying ex-expeditions, we saw my aunt, Uncle Alexander's wife with the Radom group.</sentence><sentence id="1967">They were -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom ghetto</span> was eli -- of course, as I told you before, all -- with the Russian offensive coming from the east, all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> w -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and whatever, were being shipped westward.</sentence><sentence id="1968">We didn't know that Uncle Alexander survived.</sentence><sentence id="1969">We just knew that his two sons ran away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at the beginning of the war, but we didn't know about Uncle or -- or his wife.</sentence><sentence id="1970">Sure</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1973">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 59 enough, there we saw her, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, going the other way with the rocks, and we were going this way.</sentence><sentence id="1974">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, nine people to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunk</span>, nine women.</sentence><sentence id="1975">We slept head to -- head to foot, because nine women is totally impossible to fit into this kind of an <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1976">It was just wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1977">As you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> stories -- we had to -- we were counted.</sentence><sentence id="1978">We had to line up for role call every morning.</sentence><sentence id="1979">During the quarantine, we had to do it more than twice a day.</sentence><sentence id="1980">Later on, when we worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, we had to once.</sentence><sentence id="1981">In the morning once, in the evening, but during quarantine, whenever you went <span class="NPIP">indoors</span>, they called you out again and you had to line up.</sentence><sentence

group.</sentence><sentence id="1984">Now, when we first arrived and we were -- you know, everybody's hair was cut -- I don't mean cut, you know, they grabbed alil hair and chopped it off.</sentence><sentence id="1985">My oldest sister Hanya spoke back to the women who was cutting her hair, who was a Czechoslovak woman.</sentence><sentence id="1986">For that, the Czechoslovak woman called her, "You Polish pig," and she shaved her head to zero.</sentence><sentence id="1987">Totally zero.</sentence><sentence id="1988">And they gave us clothes that of course didn't

Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2054">It was very supportive.</sentence><sentence id="2055">I'll tell you that -- as I told you, we are s -- we were traveling still with the same group.</sentence><sentence id="2056">We are still with the people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> or even if they weren't from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, they were sent in, but they were -- they were already in that group that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And the relationship was family like.</sentence><sentence id="2058">Each one was looking out for another.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And then I remember, that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> of ours received a shipment of people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaneeka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2060">Jew -- of course we couldn't -- Jewish women from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence

that.</sentence><sentence id="2064">I remember that we felt a kinship because we were a group, we were still a group, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2065">Even if -- if -- if you didn't sleep with the -- the nine people, or not all the people, you know, you still were a group.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And I -- you know and I analyze it, I always said because they knew you when, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2067">These people were still a connection to your old past and you knew them as these other people, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2068">Because the rest didn't seem human in any way.</sentence><sentence id="2069">And after this one month of quarantine, we finally were called on the job, what is called gainful employment, which was -- this could have been the end of us, that's for sure.</sentence><sentence id="2070">It was to cut twigs in the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2071">This is now August, Sept -- something like early October.</sentence><sentence id="2072">We had to march out so we would be counted.</sentence><sentence id="2073">Now it's strictly roll call twice a day.</sentence><sentence id="2074">They count us out, we had to stand -- whoever didn't look right got shot or got send out, because you couldn't go to work any more.</sentence><sentence id="2075">We would march through those <span

water, cut the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>, they would bring in cauldrons of -- of soup that's -- you know, the</sentence><sentence id="2078"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 63 Auschwitz soup.</sentence><sentence id="2079">We were fed that and then we would come back at night, count, go to -- to -- to sleep and get up in the morning and start again.</sentence><sentence id="2080">And we worked there I think for a month.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And this is also in my mind, you know -- sa -- th -- always there is -- always say a snippet of a remembrance that -- that comes out of every horrible experience that sticks in your mind.</sentence><sentence id="2082">Just like Aronka with the shoes -- why I should cry over having to -- to -- to be humiliated like this, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2083">But then there was another aspect of this kind or remembrance -- this kind of remembrance, the -- you know, from the general to the particular, we were marching to the march -- to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2084">And there were these private <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span>, private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> around it -- alon-along the <span class="DLF">route</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2085">And I think the German guards lived there or whoever.</sentence><sentence id="2086">Because it was so near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ausch</span> -- near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that you couldn't possibly have strangers.</sentence><sentence id="2087">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2088">Whoever lived there had to know everything that was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2089">So I don't know who lived there.</sentence><sentence id="2090">But anyhow, those were normal <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, they had geranium boxes in the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2091">They had pillows airing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And it broke my heart to see that people were actually living a life from which we were -- we came, too, but it was nothing in any way to compare to -- how to judge our own existence.</sentence><sentence id="2093">You see, there was this life, these people got up in the morning, it was a beautiful day, cold or hot, was beautiful, dry.</sentence><sentence id="2094">You put the <span class="DLF">windows</span> u -- put the <span class="DLF">windows</span> open, you put the pillows in the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2095">That's what people did in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And people had geranium boxes in the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2097">And of course our own assessment of who we were, wer -- was -- was already far away from what we really thought we were.</sentence><sentence id="2098">Because we were in -- so dehumanized in the process of all these particular humiliations</sentence><sentence id="2100">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 64 and the group humiliations and the murder and the -- and -- and watching.</sentence><sentence id="2101">Of course I -- I could go on and on forever to talk about all the -- the -- the -- the unnecessary brutality, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2102">Okay, sometimes you explain to yourself that you see a man si -- seeing a pair of boots and -- and running out of the <span class="DLF">line</span>-up and grabbing the pair of boots, well -- the g -- Nazi guard ha -- says to himself, "Well, I have to do it, because this is a criminal, right?"</sentence><sentence id="2103">But aside from that, when you saw the brutality and the cruelty of people to other people for no reason, it dehumanized you to the point that you yours -- your own assessment of yourself was -- is that other person that you were, is that pers -- is that you or is this, that you don't react the way you really should react to seeing those horrible things?</sentence><sentence id="2104">Of course when you are in it yourself, you are forever preoccupied with survival because that is a very strong instinct, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2105">The instinct of survival is so strong, no matter how old you are -- I don't know how it is when you're really older, but when you're a young child and you haven't lived yet and you -- and -- and then of course in the back of my mind, I always said to myself, "Gee whiz, I know my mother used to say not to say I was smart, I was good in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but I think maybe I am, you know, maybe I really, you know, I could -- I could beat this."</sentence><sentence id="2106">But then of course I realized that I was undernourished and all this and I didn't have the physical prospects of survival because I really -- I don't know how long it would have taken for me to -- to -- to just fall by the wayside there, because the jobs were -- the job was extremely, extremely hard.</sentence><sentence id="2107">And again, to talk in a historical perspective, I s-subsequently found out that there were some women who ran away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and that the Germans decided -- because you</sentence><sentence id="2109">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 65 know, the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> that were around the camp -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau camp</span>, were sort of protective.</sentence><sentence id="2110">They didn't show what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2111">But by the same token, they could hide people.</sentence><sentence id="2112">So some people made it out.</sentence><sentence id="2113">Some people were, as a matter of fact, did run away and they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="2114">You know, there were executions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that even I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2115">But the point was that when we were sent to cut the -- the brush from the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>, that was -- the reason was that the women who ran away hi-hid in there.</sentence><sentence id="2116">So they wanted now cleared.</sentence><sentence id="2117">So we had this specific idea in mind, that they really need us -- not -- not that we knew why they want to cut it, but if they wanted to cut it, that was a job and it was going to take a long time, because there was plenty of it.</sentence><sentence id="2118">So, by virtue of being needed, we had a chance to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2119">Now the question in my case was, wa -- did I have a chance to survive, physically?</sentence><sentence id="2120">Even if I outwitted myself and worked hard and ev -- would I be able to survive?</sentence><sentence id="2121">Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- life in -- up to that point -- it was no prospect of any kind of getting out of there.</sentence><sentence id="2122">We knew by then that they were burning people, because we inquired about the flesh -- the smell of the burning flesh and by then we knew.</sentence><sentence id="2123">There were other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> coming in.</sentence><sentence id="2124">The Gypsies -- lots of Gypsies were sent in.</sentence><sentence id="2125">The <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2285">A: The actual work was as follows.</sentence><sentence id="2286">You know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was an <span

Christians that were suspected of anything were called political prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2291">Some of them were political but not everybody was political, but they weren't Jews, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2292">So they had to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2296"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 68 be called something, they were called political prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2297">When they were sent into the ca -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I understand their clothes was put in a bag.</sentence><sentence id="2298">Like when we came in, we just dumped our clothes on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heap</span> and we were given whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2299">We

the <span class="BUILDING">school cafeteria</span>, you handed in that token that looked like a quarter and no child next to you or behind you, in front of you, could see that you were actually not

level of each child.</sentence><sentence id="5410">So, for example, my English was rather poor, so I was put into -- in addition to basic English, which of course we also used to -- not memorize, but

do when you want to ask a question in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="5412">That was from basic English.</sentence><sentence id="5413">But, to catch up with the English language itself, I, for example, used to take two English classes at one time.</sentence><sentence id="5414">Now, I was all -- by then I was already 17 and I was in a class with the 13 year

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5619">A: If lremember correctly, I don't think we did.</sentence><sentence id="5620">Because, you see, first of all we assumed that -- each one of us assumed -- one was Polish, one was Hungarian, one was French and whatever it was, we knew we re -- I personally was not interested in any other stories.</sentence><sentence id="5621">I knew everybody had a story to tell.</sentence><sentence id="5622">I had plenty of stories to tell.</sentence><sentence id="5623">I didn't want to live those stories, I didn't want to hear the other

English was a foreign</sentence><sentence id="5628">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 161 language to us and we had to study subjects such as history and others.</sentence><sentence id="5629">Economics, which was -- I never studied ec -- American economics, or economics at all in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5630">Or Civics.</sentence><sentence id="5631">And this required a lot of work.</sentence><sentence id="5632">Plus the fact that each one of us had some other obligation after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5633">You know, I think I mentioned it before, I lived with Miles and Kris, I kept <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I shopped for food and so on.</sentence><sentence id="5634">I also had a job in the ORT organization's office on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>, where I had to travel after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5635">And then I had to -- [-- I -- I did absolutely stupid things there, I did filing and you know, but again, this was a kind of a job that they gave me because Dr. Karpen's wife was the head of the <span

id="5638">And for me to earn this extra little money, I cannot imagine that I could do any more then than file.</sentence><sentence id="5639">But I was a filing clerk, I knew the alphabet.</sentence><sentence id="5640">So that was fine.</sentence><sentence id="5641">And all the other kids had obligations as well.</sentence><sentence id="5642">Don't forget they were more or less in my shoes, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="5643">They had either families and they also had to scramble around to do a little something to sustain themselves so that we basically compared notes pertaining to the education and to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5644">And also, we got to be friendly with the Jewish kids -- Jewish kids, a lot of Jewish kids from the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5645">That was a blue collar Jewish section in those days.</sentence><sentence id="5646">So we made wonderful friends among the Jewish kids who were normal, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="5647">Amer -- Jewish American kids.</sentence><sentence id="5648">So, all this really t-to just sum it up, didn't -- this life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jefferson</span> did not fit with sitting there comparing notes, "Did you go to Auschwitz?No, I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5649">That was past, that was water under the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="5650">Here we were, all these things were required of us, we were</sentence><sentence id="5652">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 162 all willing and as I also mentioned before, a lot of these kids became academicians.</sentence><sentence id="5653">They taught all over the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, professorship here and professor -- and everybody -- one wa -- most of these kids went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and graduated from <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5654">So that you see, we were more or less on that same level of -- of trying to get on with life in an -- this new way, excelling educationally.</sentence><sentence id="5655">Find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in this new <span class="NPIP">world</span> and who wants to talk about this old stuff?</sentence><sentence id="5656">You know, that was then and so this is basically -- for example, Miss Hay used to invite us to ca -- to tea.</sentence><sentence id="5657">She was a sort of former -- I think she was Irish by -- by -- from the fam -- anyhow, she used to invite us to tea, served beautifully, elegantly, with beautiful china

teachers went out of their way to -- to -- to -- to -- to do for us.</sentence><sentence id="5661">But also, I might add, since I was so friendly with Miss Hay for all those years after -- til af -- til the time she died, she told me, "You know, Regina, I never, ever had a class like yours after your class left -- after your class graduate."</sentence><sentence id="5662">She said it so many times and that is a fact, because this was a very special group and -- and I must tell you that -- that there must have been some kind of a spirit in these kids, for everybody to be so -- not just winning,

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5777">A: Well, you know, the idea of war, to me, when I -- when I -- when -- when second war first started, was that this was just a military engagement, you know, that soldiers fight and soldiers get killed.</sentence><sentence id="5778">And of course all this was based on the first war, not personal experience, but my knowledge of the first war, from books or from my parents, who lived through the first war.</sentence><sentence id="5779">Second war was a totally different thing, because it wasn't just that they were bombing civilians, but it was -- it came to pass that they were exterminating people for being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="5780">And that -- that was something that -- I mean, not only incomprehensible, but unbelievable and people wouldn't admit it and I don't know if I've mentioned it in the other tapes, but I always talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="5781">To this day, I had no idea what my parents knew, how much they knew, what they knew, but I do know that they did hide a lot from us.</sentence><sentence id="5782">In fact, they hid everything from us, because they nev -- I never knew</sentence><sentence id="5784">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 166 the truth of -- and I suspect that they knew a whole lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="5785">Of the atrocities that were going on.</sentence><sentence id="5786">You know, my parents perished in the Holocaust, but even during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> years and all this, I am sure they knew a lot, because there were people coming and going and reporting what's happening here and there -- never, ever was I let in on what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="5787">And of course I saw with my own eyes, plenty, so maybe they felt it's bad enough for a child to see and experience here, but not yet to live with the fear of what is really happening somewhere else, which is probably not true.</sentence><sentence id="5788">That was the attitude.</sentence><sentence id="5789">It couldn't be true, because such a thing couldn't be true, you know, that you take groups of people and you burn them or you gas them.</sentence><sentence id="5790">So that's just gossip and during the war, there's so much gossip, so why burden a child with this type of talk?</sentence><sentence id="5791">So you see, my idea of -- of war, after it was o -- after the second war was all over, was really that it brought out the beast in the human being.</sentence><sentence id="5792">It had nothing to do with <span class="REGION">land</span>, you know, reclaiming your <span class="REGION">land</span> one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="5793">It was nothing to do with fighting for the -- for your culture or for your moral standards.</sentence><sentence id="5794">It was just the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="5795">It was just a beastly expression of a human nature, which unfortunately fell within the new technology and it found it's expression in annihilating by the youth of new technology and not the armed conflict of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, but of just people being eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="5796">So this was basically my understanding of -- of -- you know, after all was said and done and I start -- started reading history, it go -- just confirmed what I have already experienced, that this was not a war like any other war.</sentence><sentence id="5797">That I knew Napoleonic wars and Franco -- the German war and this war and that war, that -- those were wars that th -- the Crimean war -- this war</sentence><sentence id="5799">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 167 was nothing like it and of course the -- having confirmed it by studies, further studies, it - - it just reinforced by so many more ho-horrendous details of things that I really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="5800">History f -- the -- that I got -- the history of the second war, that I got out of books, really built on my own understanding.</sentence><sentence id="5801">So it sort of rounded it out and I came away with - - precisely with the same concept as I had

elderly lady now.</sentence><sentence id="6929">We discussed it, she also was really v-v- very much on the -- on -- on my wavelength, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="6930">We're still around and we must do it.</sentence><sentence id="6931">If they -- whoever doesn't like it -- the Polish community will not do it.</sentence><sentence id="6932">A, they're poor, B, they're not interested, C, they would rather have <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> built there than have a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>, because who's here?</sentence><sentence id="6933">There's nobody around, nobody will know and such and such.</sentence><sentence id="6934">So we did this one thing that we accomplished, we registered the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, just before the list was closed for the Jewish cemeteries that were going to be given to the Polish government.</sentence><sentence id="6935">So we got that done.</sentence><sentence id="6936">After that, when they -- I have already spoken about it, when the idea of them -- collecti -- thing the money was -- came -- it was the easiest things, I just didn't call the other people and called those that gave and they gave and money went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, then the man was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and things were done and it's done.</sentence><sentence id="6937">And it's -- it's easier than -- th-than pie, as they say.</sentence><sentence id="6938">Had I known, I would have -- or maybe you know, on the other hand, maybe 1980 people weren't quite ready yet for that.</sentence><sentence id="6939">That's -- you know, you really have to be in a special frame of mind to undertake a certain -- a certain obligation.</sentence><sentence id="6940">I saw this in 1980 because I saw it with my own eyes.</sentence><sentence id="6941">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were being built, the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was neglected, it was overgrown, it was -- the -- the -- the monuments were knocked over.</sentence><sentence id="6942">The Germans took out a lot of the monuments and they paved <span class="DLF">streets</span> with it.</sentence><sentence id="6943">And I said, "If you allowed what's going on til now, another year or two, there'll be nothing there."</sentence><sentence

<span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6949">And through her, you see, after I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I was constant correspondence with her.</sentence><sentence id="6950">She went again and then she wrote me a letter, she said -- three years later, she says, "Whatever you and your husband saw, there is less of it now."</sentence><sentence id="6951">When I had that letter, I hit the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6952">And so this, I think, was the final -- the final push that I needed.</sentence><sentence id="6953">And I got in touch with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I got in touch with everybody else and I said, "We do it or we'll never have it and let's forget everybody else."</sentence><sentence id="6954">So this was a fulfillment, not -- to answer your question, it wasn't only because I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to grieve.</sentence><sentence id="6955">I have nobody in that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, we never did have anybody there.</sentence><sentence id="6956">This was to preserve a token, that this is a token, to preserve a little bit of sacred soil, so to say, to show that there was a vibrant community here at one time and is no more and -- and if it takes money to do it -- to perpetuate it, that could be done.</sentence><sentence id="6957">There are a lot of survivors whose children are interested and there's no reason why this cannot be perpetuated, to be -- to have a caretaker and to just keep that little bit of whatever was left.</sentence><sentence id="6958">I personally don't even need -- read Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="6959">I couldn't even read the -- the monuments.</sentence><sentence id="6960">Victor took close up pictures, I brought it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I asked some people to read the names.</sentence><sentence

There was some -- there is something else that is very -- or was very -- or is very important for you to talk about, and that has to do with your profession as an translator.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6969">You did work about Yannish Korchuk?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6970">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6972">Q: Who was a very important --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6973">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6974">Q: -- impressive figure.</sentence><sentence id="6975">Do you want to say a little bit more about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6978">A: Yes, well actually, my translation does not have much bearing with the Korchuk -- you see, I -- I used to write and publish articles and such and those are two separate issues, so maybe I will start with the Korchuk, okay?</sentence><sentence id="6979">And then with the translation, cause those are separate issues.</sentence><sentence id="6980">I was -- and still am, for many years, a member of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences.</sentence><sentence id="6981">It's an academic institution of -- i-it was organized by Polish Jewish -- Polish Christian -- Polish Jewish scholars during the war, when they ran away from Europe.</sentence><sentence id="6982">And this was an academic institution and it has always done things that pertain to Polish academic life.</sentence><sentence id="6983">And culture, too, but Koschushka Foundation, which is another organization, Polish organization, deals more with the cultural aspect, but the Polish Institute was always part of the academic world.</sentence><sentence id="6984">American fit into the academic world, cause a lot of the people there were the professors, professors in <span class="BUILDING">American universities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6985">Anyhow, in the early 80's, a dialog was started, a Polish Jewish dialog, you know.</sentence><sentence id="6986">There is a Polish Jewish dialog in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, there is one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6987">There -- there are Polish Jewish dialogs forever going on everywhere, but not much progress ha -- some</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="6991">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 202 progress has been made, but not as much as it could have.</sentence><sentence id="6992">Anyhow, there was an idea arose that because Ko-Korchuk was a humanitarian, who was a great educator, philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="6993">He was also, you know, a doctor who organized the famous <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span>, who had this new idea of child upbringing and he was an assimilated Polish Jew, who also suffered anti-Semitism while he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6994">He was a -- a 19th century man who lived under the Russian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="6995">Well, Korchuk was a humanist of men of the highest moral and ethical standards.</sentence><sentence id="6996">Of the highest devotion to -- to -- to humanity.</sentence><sentence id="6997">And because his considered himself a Polish Jew and a Jewish Pole, it was decided, whoever it was, Polish organizations and Jewish organizations decided to use Korchuk's name as a core, as a central piece of a Polish Jewish dialog.</sentence><sentence id="6998">I was nominated from the <span class="BUILDING">Polish Institute</span> to become -- to join the group of people who were organizing this dialog.</sentence><sentence id="6999">And this was in the nine -- early 1980's, "81, "82, "83, "84.</sentence><sentence id="7000">Anyhow, we would meet at the ADL, at the <span class="BUILDING">ameri</span> -- Anti-Defamation League.</sentence><sentence id="7001">The -- the whole idea was -- because he was also a great writer, he wrote books for children and about children.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="7002">Books on psychology about children, but fantastic books for children.</sentence><sentence id="7003">I -- he also had a radio program and every child -- he used to read books to children.</sentence><sentence id="7004">So every child who grew up in the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in the inter war years, would know Korchuk's stories.</sentence><sentence id="7005">Anyhow, he was used as a central figure for the dialog.</sentence><sentence id="7006">And in a competition -- international book competition was established, where books would be submitted for children -- books written for children, or about children -- two separate categories.</sentence><sentence id="7007">And, when the prizes were going to be given out, then it would be a gathering of Polish and Jewish -- Polish</sentence></p><p><sentence id="7010"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 203 Christian and -- and Jewish Polish group meet and we would have ceremonies and so.</sentence><sentence id="7011">I became a what you call reader, because I do book reviews a lot.</sentence><sentence id="7012">I ri -- I do book reviews for the American Translators Association and anyhow, since I wrote a lot of book reviews, too.</sentence><sentence id="7013">So I became a book reader and I -- because I also worked in the <span class="BUILDING">Children's Library</span> here for 11 years, I picked the children's books.</sentence><sentence id="7014">So I would have 20 - 25 books to read.</sentence><sentence id="7015">And I had an outline, how to mark that.</sentence><sentence id="7016">We would submit it, then the judges would decided and then there would be a ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="7017">Now I really am very much interested in reading you the names of the organizations which participated.</sentence><sentence id="7018">Unfortunately this is now all past tense, because this whole thing fell apart, this whole ca -- dialog.</sentence><sentence id="7019">We had it for about four or five years and then it didn't terminate, it petered out.</sentence><sentence id="7020">There was never an official notice, we no longer do it, we -- whatever.</sentence><sentence id="7021">All of a sudden -- I didn't get a notice, there will be a fo -- there will be -- I was never notified that they're going to send me a boo -- box of books.</sentence><sentence id="7022">I never heard from anybody, nobody ever heard from anybody and the thing just thinned out into the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7023">So I thought if I read you some of this -- these participating groups, which was a mixture of Polish Christian and Polish Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="7024">So there were the anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith, the American Council of Polish Cultural Clubs, the American Federation of Jewish Fighters, Camp inmates and Nazi victims, Federation of Polish Jews in the United States Holocaust Library.</sentence><sentence id="7025">The Koschushka Foundation, which I told you before is a cultural Polish organization.</sentence><sentence id="7026">The North American Study

of the <span class="BUILDING">institute</span>, not as a representative from his paper.</sentence><sentence id="7038">He cannot be a newspaperman and be listed, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="7039">Well anyhow, this, as you could see, was a very well integrated type of a group.</sentence><sentence id="7040">People on very high level of -- of achievement -- organizations and such.</sentence><sentence id="7041">One of -- we met -- a few of these award ceremonies took place in [indecipherable] here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7042">One took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, I remember traveling -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy Center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7043">One wa -- had the Cheswafmeewash, the Polish Nobel Prize winning poet, as keynote speaker.</sentence><sentence id="7044">Once they had Governor Keene from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- from <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, a -- he was the governor then, a keynote speaker.</sentence><sentence id="7045">They had very interesting keynote speakers -- was lovely get together, the prizes were handed out.</sentence><sentence id="7046">First prize I think was thousand dollars, second prize -- and there were two separate categories, as I told you.</sentence><sentence id="7047">One was books for children, one was books about children.</sentence><sentence id="7048">And the books actually were submitted internationally.</sentence><sentence id="7049">That means, the books from <span

RG-50.549.02*0013 205 like this go on and much as these -- this group was in agreement that Korchuk personified the very essence of what humanitarian d-deeds should be about, as much as he personified the Pole and the Jew, all one, as -- as the humanist, you see?</sentence><sentence id="7055">As the -- as the person of -- of the highest ethical standard.</sentence><sentence id="7056">He personified humanity, so he had to personify Polish Christians and Polish Jews all at once and because he was assimilated and he was a man of both worlds, you see?</sentence><sentence id="7057">Both the Christian and the Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="7058">He was not of the religious type of Jews, he -- they were -- there was an assimilated family.</sentence><sentence id="7059">His father I think was a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7132">A: Well, P'll tell you frankly, I am very much impressed by the work they're doing.</sentence><sentence id="7133">I think the <span

and the way it's run and the way they have it all, is so impressive.</sentence><sentence id="7138">I'll tell you, I went to the -- the -- the Holo -- not the Holocaust -- the <span

the Holocaust deals primarily with the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="7142">I was more impressed by the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> concept and I think it hits you much stronger than this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, because when you go to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, you feel that you've been to a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7143">When you go to the other <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, it's an experience that shakes you up.</sentence><sentence

not to forget what happened and to learn from that experience.</sentence><sentence id="7148">And I'll tell you, I told Miles about it.</sentence><sentence id="7149">This is -- | met somebody in <span

telling me.</sentence><sentence id="7159">So, he says, "You must go there."</sentence><sentence id="7160">He says, "You</sentence><sentence id="7162">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 209 know, it's all about the war and what the Germans did to the Jews, and," he says, "I can't get over it."</sentence><sentence id="7163">Well, I told him, "I'm so glad you saw it, because I do happen to know about

the way from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span>, they -- where they visited fa-family, who never had any intention of going, but somehow or other he heard something and he went to

to go there immediately.</sentence><sentence id="7170">And I told Miles, I said, "Spread the word in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, that whatever it's you're doing, you're doing it very

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7375">A: Well, you know that your -- your -- your group identity, so to say -- let's put it ina bigger framework, relates basically to your childhood.</sentence><sentence id="7376">This is the way I see it.</sentence><sentence id="7377">I do not -- excuse me -- I do not come from a very religious family, observant or strictly religious.</sentence><sentence id="7378">Our parents were Progressive Jews, very much interested in Zionism and also attached to Judaism through religion, but certainly not of the Hassidic type that was prevalent in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in between the wars.</sentence><sentence id="7379">And of course, this sort of rubbed off on us children, the idea, the -- the very strong idef -- identification with the Jewish people, but not through religion.</sentence><sentence id="7380">Not -- no, not through religion strict observance -- through religious observance, but rather on a -- on a -- on another level than the Hassidic, that the prevalent observance was -- was known for at that time.</sentence><sentence id="7381">Consequently, obviously, I had -- I did go to -- to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, as I told you, which was -- dealt with Jewish religion and it had dealt with the Bible and Jewish history, but that was sort of more secular, by nature and so was our life at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, even though my grandmother was very religious, which I also mentioned prior to this ex -- to this interview.</sentence><sentence id="7382">I seem to have continued in that <span class="DLF">vein</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7383">It</sentence><sentence id="7385">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 215 was lucky when I married Victor, that his family was affiliated with a <span class="BUILDING">Reform Temple</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> -- a rather well-known <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>, with -- Rabbi Steinback was his name, he was a poet and a writer and an army chaplain and he was also a very inspired type of clergyman, you know, he talked poetry and he -- even when he married us, it was, "What a -- what two beautiful names, Regina and Victor.</sentence><sentence id="7386">Can you imagine a combination of two names like --" you know, he made a whole to-do about it.</sentence><sentence id="7387">Those were his sermons, that was his approach.</sentence><sentence id="7388">That was Victor's background, this Rabbi Steinback.</sentence><sentence id="7389">When we got married, we discovered that we more a -- we are on the same level.</sentence><sentence id="7390">My identity -- Jewish identity was stronger than Victor's, because of the Zionist connection, number one and of course the fact that I was singled out during the war for being Jewish and nobody ever let me forget it.</sentence><sentence id="7391">You know, for the fact that I was going to be a victim any second, just because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="7392">So that most certainly, if nothing else, would remind me that that's what I am.</sentence><sentence id="7393">So that when we got married, we also joined a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Reform Temple</span>, in our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7394">And our -- both children were Bar Mitzvahed in that <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7395">We -- we don't have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, you know, we observe the Jewish holidays, we are members of the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> all these years, the same <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7396">That goes back 35 years at least and -- we are not active in the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>, even though they were trying to get us in, somehow or other, I don't know, we never got involved in the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>, but we are certainly very much interested in supporting the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> financially and seeing that it's viable then.</sentence><sentence id="7397">And we enjoy going there to <span class="BUILDING">services</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7398">We go -- th-they have a Kristallnacht observance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novembers</span>, we go to that all the time.</sentence><sentence id="7399">We go to the Shoah observances, we go to -- in between the Jewish</sentence><sentence id="7401"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0013 216 holidays, but we do not go regularly, like weekend services.</sentence><sentence id="7402">We don't go regularly, every now and then we do go, so that to this day my religious orientation is within those bounds of -- of an inner life that does not need the reinforcement, but it needs the connection, you see?</sentence><sentence id="7403">The connection to -- to -- to Reform Judaism is very fine with me.</sentence><sentence id="7404">It -- it keeps me within the frame that can accommodate my inner self, you see?</sentence><sentence id="7405">Whereas if you put me to be with the Lubavitches, I would probably be rebelling to the point where I would deny that I'm Jewish, because I probably could not accept it as part of who I am.</sentence><sentence id="7406">You see, there's too na -- th-th-th-th -- their -- their focus is too narrow and so on.</sentence><sentence id="7407">The <span class="BUILDING">Reform Temple</span> has a wider focus and -- and that suits us very well.</sentence><sentence id="7408">So, to that extent, we are good Jews, so to say, not religious.</sentence><sentence id="7409">And certainly, as far as identity is concerned, not only hundred percent identity of Judaism, but a million percent, if there is such a thing, you see?</sentence><sentence id="7410">So, I -- I -- I hope this answers your question.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7455">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="7456">You see, I -- since I did not come from a background where religion was the answer, I did not seek the answer in religion during the war, obviously, you know?And I don't know that I -- I -- I -- I ever followed this idea of everything being preordained or predetermined.</sentence><sentence id="7457">I -- I believe in -- in free will, you see, and -- and so when I bak -- was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I became old enough to appreciate the philosophical un- underpinnings of religion, I rather liked where I came from, you see, and I was happy with the way I was and I'm happy the way I am.</sentence><sentence id="7458">And obviously we would have -- we</sentence><sentence id="7460">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 217 would have changed one way or another, but obviously we carried on, in -- at the -- in the same vein, right through, so it has to sit well with us, otherwise we wouldn't do it, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="7495">My very best, dearest friend committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="7496">She was from that connection, but that's an whole other story, because she was very dependent on me for many years, so she was more like friend because she -- she was psychologically</sentence><sentence id="7498">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0013 218 damaged and she was part of my family as long as she lived, for the reason that she was a needy person.</sentence><sentence id="7499">I don't mean financially, you know, she had a Ph.D. and everything, but she was needy, very needy.</sentence><sentence
