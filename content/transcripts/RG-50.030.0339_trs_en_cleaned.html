<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Joseph, as we begin talking about the period after the liberation, I just want to make sure that we covered everything that you wanted to before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: There was one episode that I meant to cite and I will do it now.</sentence><sentence id="4">In those first few days of September of 1942, when the mass deportation started, my mother had been taken away.</sentence><sentence id="5">My father and my sister had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> because the Germans who were shrinking and shrinking the size of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">It was hot.</sentence><sentence id="7">It was summer and there was no <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their head anymore so we lived in the <span class="DLF">street</span> for about three days and three nights on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">When I finally obtained my father's permission to leave him for a few minutes because I wanted to look up my buddies from the resistance movement, something which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight of me in case we don't find each other again or that one of us will be swept up by yet another Razzia.</sentence><sentence id="9">I, walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I ran into one of the two fellows who a year and a half before recruited me for the resistance movement Hashomer Hatzair.</sentence><sentence id="10">This was Richard, we called him Rishak.</sentence><sentence id="11">He had the look of an insane person rushing about, and I asked him well where are the leaders and where is our <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and he finally gave me an address where I could find our company commander, a girl about 17.</sentence><sentence id="12">The word being Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, the taller of us three who also with him recruited me into the resistance movement, he told me that several days before the two of them were caught by the curfew.</sentence><sentence id="13">They had managed to work their way homesby a few minutes.</sentence><sentence id="14">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were deserted.</sentence><sentence id="15">The punishment for violating the curfew was often</sentence><sentence id="17">instant execution in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">So, the two of them darted into a store front and were flat against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> when the German gendarme went by.</sentence><sentence id="19">German gendarme, who paroled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> most of the time in addition to the SS who used to come in for forays, for selection, but mainly after 9:00 in the evening it was the gendarmes, you might call it the military policemen.</sentence><sentence id="20">They discovered them and as Richie had time to tell me in those few words with the commotion in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and throngs of hundreds of people milling about not knowing where to go what to do with themselves, waiting yet another selection.</sentence><sentence id="21">He said when the German gendarme approached them and asked them what they were doing in German, the gendarme turned to the taller Simon who was always the more combative one, the more bellicose one of us three.</sentence><sentence id="22">He always felt that when the time comes, the sooner the better that we should fight with whatever we had at our disposal.</sentence><sentence id="23">The German gendarme turned to him and called him "Du verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which means you Goddamn Jewish pig.</sentence><sentence id="24">Richard said Simon shot back and said you Goddamn German pig, at which point the gendarme shot him between the eyes.</sentence><sentence id="25">That's how we lost our closest friend, and at that point Richard, with his half insane look on his face said I got to go.</sentence><sentence id="26">I got to look for my father.</sentence><sentence id="27">I don't know where my father is.</sentence><sentence id="28">So, I went back to join my father and my sister in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Let me ask you one question.</sentence><sentence id="58">The years after that when hiding you were a catholic boy when you converted, did you have any information or contact with Jewish people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Since I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in the first few days of September of "42, other than sneaking into two more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span>, in the provincial small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, which</sentence><sentence id="63">lasted a few weeks before the deportations there started also.</sentence><sentence id="64">Once I was on my own again, and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants, as of November "43 going to <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span> with new Polish documents and Polish catholic until the end of the war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="65">I had no idea what became of them except that common talk had it that they were all either having been exterminated or they're in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and that there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="66">I did not know about the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> obviously at that point, but I had the foreboding based on tidbits that they're either all exterminated or about to be exterminated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: What about</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like.</sentence><sentence id="78">The entire focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that meant watching my facial expressions, my gesticulations, my "true story" where I came from, my identity obviously changed as to my background, my schooling, who my parents were, watching my speech.</sentence><sentence id="79">Because one could give one self away with one word.</sentence><sentence id="80">Even though we were quite Polanized, coming from a certain <span class="NPIP">environment</span> one accrues a lexicon of words that one doesn't even think about.</sentence><sentence id="81">Whether one be an Irishman or a Jew or an Italian, every now and then you use a certain word which under normal circumstances it is accepted and is part of the mosaic of life especially when there are some minorities in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">You don't think of that, but when you try to play another role as it were and pose for someone else, one could give one's self away with a word.</sentence><sentence id="83">I'll never forget by the time I got to <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> and my German was already</sentence><sentence id="85">so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke to a German and I used the word for bread Broit.</sentence><sentence id="86"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Broit</span> is the Yiddish, Brot is the German.</sentence><sentence id="87">Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to speak to the Germans, | used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot.</sentence><sentence id="88">And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word.</sentence><sentence id="89">Fortunately the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I was the "educated city boy."</sentence><sentence id="90">So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this word, not to use that word, and taught me a new melody of speech.</sentence><sentence id="92">In other words, a pygmaleon, he was remaking me right down to how to hold my lips together because he felt that Jews by and large were more sensuous people and their lips were by and large thicker.</sentence><sentence id="93">Many Poles so he felt had a thinner line of lips, so then he coached me that when I'm not actually speaking to hold my lips together like this.</sentence><sentence id="94">In order to project a thinner <span class="DLF">lip line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">So, I was -- ever since those days when he started remaking my identity as it were, for years and years after the war as I see it now, I have been groomed to play a role, and that lasted for years and years after the war, until not too long ago, maybe ten or fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own self.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: I want to get to that a little bit later.</sentence><sentence id="124">Let's pick up from when you were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="125">If you can remember that for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thuringen</span>, which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which I believe was April 13, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="130">A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy of my boss, where he found a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we would not have to stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span>, because that's where there were a lot of Americans.</sentence><sentence id="132">So, we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span>, there were a lot of G.I.s.</sentence><sentence id="133">In front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to describe how it felt.</sentence><sentence id="134">A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all around.</sentence><sentence id="135">It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground high school courses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="136">One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it.</sentence><sentence id="137">They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat.</sentence><sentence id="138">When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first lieutenant Preston.</sentence><sentence id="139">That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British</sentence><sentence id="141">stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, tall very presentable, asked me whether I knew German.</sentence><sentence id="142">I said Yes, I do.</sentence><sentence id="143">Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know some Russian.</sentence><sentence id="144">He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating apparently.</sentence><sentence id="145">So, I studied interpreting.</sentence><sentence id="146">I was then 17, for the American G.Ls.</sentence><sentence id="147">He asked me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier.</sentence><sentence id="148">My job there was ostensibly as an interpreter and all around helper.</sentence><sentence id="149">I suppose some people call guys like me in those days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops.</sentence><sentence id="150">Within about a week later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> simply because the Americans were there.</sentence><sentence id="151">Help me with this and help me with that.</sentence><sentence id="152">It was a whole movement of nations.</sentence><sentence id="153">Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out later some got pretty rough treatment.</sentence><sentence id="154">They were moving out.</sentence><sentence id="155">This American unit and they asked me if I wanted to go with them.</sentence><sentence id="156">Well, you might as well of put me on the moon of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them.</sentence><sentence id="157">By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet.</sentence><sentence id="158">There was candy and cigarettes and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="159">It wasn't until a few weeks later when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that unit what.</sentence><sentence id="160">To me they were just American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="161">They were CIC.</sentence><sentence id="162">Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's.</sentence><sentence id="163">So, I traveled with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">There were at the most</sentence><sentence id="166">ten of them in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detachment</span> headed by Major Lobb who I was told by one of the CIC men a New Yorker or a Jewish fellow said that son of a gun, he was the judge who once found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">Major Loeb who was a prince of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope with.</sentence><sentence id="168">In the best English I could offer him when he came into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the evening, because wherever we went they commandeered the <span class="BUILDING">German hotel</span>, I told him I was a catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these.</sentence><sentence id="169">Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with.</sentence><sentence id="170">A foreign national, Pole or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships with a German girl, which was unthinkable.</sentence><sentence id="171">Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or severely beaten by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="172">That was to preserve the purity of the German race.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, I had had absolutely no experience with a man or a woman.</sentence><sentence id="174">Within a few days after I was liberated and I was with these American G.Is in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where they were stationed.</sentence><sentence id="175">One of them asked me if I could play <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and I said yes a little bit and I sat down to play <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">I had short pants.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was April and he sidled up to me and he put his hand inside my pants and started fondling me as I was playing piano.</sentence><sentence id="178">This was a few days after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="179">That was before I found out that they were CIC.</sentence><sentence id="180">To me they were just normal American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="181">Within a couple of weeks two of them had made advances to me.</sentence><sentence id="182">That was part of my exposure to my great liberators and it wasn't until years, years later when I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> and acquired a little bit more street wisdom and exposure to the world that I</sentence><sentence id="184">learned that as the saying goes the intelligence community not to mention the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">diplomatic community</span> is disportionately staffed by homosexuals.</sentence><sentence id="185">My experience in the American counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17.</sentence><sentence id="186">As we drove with my liberators -- and the advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want them.</sentence><sentence id="187">The CIC detachment followed the front line troops throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> almost to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">As soon as the American troops occupied a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the CIC was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them.</sentence><sentence id="189">Once we were caught in the cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it turned out that that had not yet been freed by <span class="DLF">front line</span> troops.</sentence><sentence id="190">Wherever we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it went - - we had 13:25: gone through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> and a number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">southern German cities</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and I remember we were stationed for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ried</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innkreis</span> meaning the district of Inn and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was Reid.</sentence><sentence id="191">As soon as we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was liberated, we had four or five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis who had been on the list.</sentence><sentence id="192">So, this was basically the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could.</sentence><sentence id="193">I have not seen any bad treatment except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat them up very badly.</sentence><sentence id="194">Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I would hear from another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he would break <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> over their heads and so on and a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when they didn't want to answer questions.</sentence><sentence id="195">Eventually, by the time that our unit was commandeered back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, the CIC unit I believe was being</sentence><sentence id="197">transferred or sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so that I was taken by one of the officers to an MP unit, Military Police, and that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, with the recommendation that the MPs could use an interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="198">By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient.</sentence><sentence id="199">I was with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> of the MPs being <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and fed and of course living with them and having a GI uniform without insignia, for many weeks.</sentence><sentence id="200">This was when I gradually emboldened by my liberation began to confide in one or two soldiers about my true background.</sentence><sentence id="201">That I was Polish but I was also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="202">Although by and large the Gls and MPs with whom I was living and working were a magnificent lot of young people.</sentence><sentence id="203">They were mostly draftees.</sentence><sentence id="204">They couldn't wait to count their points to be repatriated and to be released from the army.</sentence><sentence id="205">To them I was a kid, 17 and Polish and anxious to help them and grateful.</sentence><sentence id="206">They treated me magnificently.</sentence><sentence id="207">But, as the word got out that I was also Jewish, I started experiencing a few incidents of anti- semitism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: It was a noticeable change?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Significantly, I remember standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for chow, the 14:04: army meal, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> where we were quartered.</sentence><sentence id="298">One MP sergeant with whom I only had a passing acquaintance was in the <span class="DLF">line</span> nearby and he started calling me the Jew boy.</sentence><sentence id="299">As it turned out he was of Polish ethnic background from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">Then, a time came soon after when I was ordered to undergo house arrest.</sentence><sentence id="301">The lieutenant Dempsey I remember his name a strapping, huge giant of a man from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> who behaved towards me like an older brother with no hint of homosexuality whatsoever, always protected me and liked me.</sentence><sentence id="302">He told me that the major of the MPs, the provost marshall of that division, didn't</sentence><sentence id="304">0 like Jews and ordered me house arrest for me.</sentence><sentence id="305">Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them abominably,sometimes would lock them up.</sentence><sentence id="306">I asked him why he would he do that and he said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for all?</sentence><sentence id="307">This was my dream of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, equality, justice from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looking in.</sentence><sentence id="308">He said, yes, except for the blacks.</sentence><sentence id="309">And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background.</sentence><sentence id="310">But his superior officer, Major, also from the deep south, hated the Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, because the major the provost marshall put me in a house arrest for as long as he would deliberate what to do with me next.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: What was the basis for house arrest?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his outrage but saying this was his superior officer.</sentence><sentence id="330">I can't do anything about.</sentence><sentence id="331">And strangely enough, a man who became a friend of mine for years later in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, an attorney in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watertown</span>, <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span>, an Irish man, John Corbot, who befriended me</sentence><sentence id="333">1 also because he was one of the MPs.</sentence><sentence id="334">Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and would bring me things to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> we became friends for years to come.</sentence><sentence id="335">So, that's another face of an American soldier.</sentence><sentence id="336">But, I never lost faith in the ideals of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I wanted to go there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American people as exemplified by some of the soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="337">Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> which was a Polish displaced persons camp.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: So, when I got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span>, at the time when the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to be registered, most had lost their i.d.</sentence><sentence id="354">cards and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="355">I then had a talk with myself because there was no one I could trust or knew what name I should use.</sentence><sentence id="356">My official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="357">When the time came to register at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish DP camp</span>, I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name.</sentence><sentence id="358">Pride in my family and my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the</sentence><sentence id="360">2 weeks went by into August, September of 1945 and as I lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with one of the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of anti-semitism among my fellow Poles.</sentence><sentence id="361">It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse.</sentence><sentence id="362">So, here I was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic comments, time and again, with most of them or all of them not knowing that I was also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="363">This is no <span class="NPIP">time and place</span>, and I'm not a historian in order to make a case where there was anti-semitism in almost any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and there was some anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, and the fact that there was six years of constant barrage on the average uneducated Pole by the German occupying authorities ridiculing Jews showing in the press caricatures of the Jew with the hook nose who is out to rob everybody and cheat everybody and for a case can be made, but this is no time and place for me to raise that.</sentence><sentence id="364">The fact is is that I began to experience almost daily anti-semitic conversations.</sentence><sentence id="365">That didn't make it easy, and when I was asked about the origin of the name of Fajwiszys which to those who know origin of names, might recognize that it is a Jewish name, I would say that it was a Lithuanian name, because a great many of Lithuanian names end is i-s.

be known as Polish guard, but we where in the service of the American army not armed because the soviets launched a huge propaganda that we were out to liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that the Americans and the British were cultivating this force in order to march on <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but we were guarding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American depots</span> and

moments that I resolved at the first opportunity I would have I would revert back to my assumed name, Polish name Kutrzeba, but how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="483">The best way to do it when I was about to join that Polish force even though I continued to study at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> whenever I could, attended lectures, and that 15:04: was the time to obtain a new

new story in order to as by that time I pledged to myself remain Polish and catholic and make an absolutely clean break with Jews, and eventually hoping to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> into yet another lions den and I say it advisedly just as went into <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> with fake Polish documents hoping that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I would be less apt to be found out a Jew than by fellow Polish nationals.</sentence><sentence id="489">This time I felt I would go to <span

class="COUNTRY">American</span> as long as you do your job well, nobody cares who you are.</sentence><sentence id="490">Well, we'll get to that.</sentence><sentence id="491">So, when I appeared 15:06: before the captain and told him that Fajwiszys was a name that I took on because I didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the event that I was forced to go under my original name Kutrzeba.</sentence><sentence id="492">The name Kutrzeba has produced two famous persons in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">One was a revered history professor

me.</sentence><sentence id="494">He asked me whether I was related, the captain that is, to General Kutrzeba, and I said no not really.</sentence><sentence id="495">Within one week I was accepted to enroll and I started within weeks as a corporal, later went to a sergeant and eventually became a second lieutenant with my main duties being teaching English to Polish troops as most of them were hoping to emigrate to an English speaking <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="496">But I also performed the duties of the officer of the day every sixth day or so.</sentence><sentence id="497">It was months later that I found out from one of the members of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">company</span> that Captain Voiski told him</sentence><sentence id="499">0 that he knew General Kutrzeba, that I looked like him.</sentence><sentence id="500">He was convinced that I was his son except that I was denying it preferring not to ask for extra favors and that was the reason that he hired me even though it was extremely difficult to be hired since the American Army put a quota on how many could be hired.</sentence><sentence id="501">So, then I spent two years as an officer for the Polish guard force working directly for the American

One day my number came up.</sentence><sentence id="649">I had no affidavit.</sentence><sentence id="650">I had no relatives that I knew of or wanted to contact.</sentence><sentence id="651">Eventually I learned that my father's brother lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for 40 some years, and eventually I got to him.</sentence><sentence id="652">But I put my name on the list and it turned out that this was a contingent provided with blank affidavits by the Connecticut Tobacco Growers.</sentence><sentence id="653"><span class="COUNTRY">Connecticut</span> had been growing cigar tobacco for years and years, shaded fields, very hard labor.</sentence><sentence id="654">Well, a Mr. McCormick from near <span class="REGION">Bradleyfield Connecticut</span> who wanted to get cheap labor, nothing wrong with that, American capitalist, you know, make money where 15:20: you can, had some Jamaican blacks but he wanted to have some nicer white boys from Europe.</sentence><sentence id="655">And through the NCWC, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Conference of American Bishops who were acting as the Jewish organizations were and others, to provide blank affidavits for young Polish refugees who had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn.</sentence><sentence id="656">So, I came under that quota with $10 in my pocket flown by the Flying Tiger Company in 1950 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Keflavik</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span>, New Foundland, because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> could not make the transatlantic trip yet, was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaGuardia</span>, and driven right to a <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> where we started the next morning at 6:00.</sentence><sentence id="657">I and some twenty other Polish young men with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go were grateful that we were able to obtain American visa and the time was April 1950.</sentence><sentence id="658">We came on the <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> and were shown our lodgings which were the former <span class="BUILDING">CCC barracks</span>, Civilian Conservation Corp under Roosevelt, clapped together with wooden boards, a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> of maybe 30, 40 persons double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> half of them black Jamaican negroes and</sentence><sentence id="660">5 half of us young Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="661">Work was back breaking under the shades, there were nets hung to protect the cigar tobacco in case of rain so that the leaves would not be destroyed by rain or hail.</sentence><sentence id="662">So, I was working 90 degrees in that heat under the nets which were back breaking and humid beyond description.</sentence><sentence id="663">75 cents an hour, half of the weekly income was deducted for our food and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> meaning <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the food was made by Jamaican cooks.</sentence><sentence id="664">To go to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span> over the weekend we would probably spend the entire weekly wage whatever was left of it after taxes and deductions for food.</sentence><sentence id="665">This was my beginning in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="666">War in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out six weeks after I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and when I weighed in my mind what to do next, am I going to finish university studies which were almost out of the land of fantasy, and income and job, I had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> in Hartford Connecticut to volunteer for the airforce.</sentence><sentence id="667">I was by that time 22.</sentence><sentence id="668">I was in reasonably good condition, and I wanted to become a pilot and when I think now what motivated me to volunteer for the U.S. air force, I think there are at least three elements and in what proportion I'm not able to say.</sentence><sentence id="669">One was that in my own view of romantic idealism still in all despite some individual incidents in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the liberation, I was alive because so many Americans died to conquer Hitler's machine.</sentence><sentence id="670">I was liberated by the American army.</sentence><sentence id="671">I was given entry into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="672">Now, as I saw it in my fairly naive romantic mind this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="673">It's being attacked by an enemy, that's the North Koreans, so I would volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="674">Secondly, I would feel proud to wear a legitimate American uniform.</sentence><sentence id="675">Now, I'm fully legitimate finally.</sentence><sentence id="676">Thirdly, I felt that I would not have to work on a --by that time I know longer worked on a <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> because I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Hartford</span> I believe.</sentence><sentence id="677">Very, very difficult job where I threw up many times because there was no <span class="DLF">air</span></sentence><sentence id="679">6 conditioning, hot in the summer, working on a machine having to do a quota, also 75 cents an hour and my stomach started acting up and I started throwing up because I was not used to the combination of milk shakes on one hand which I couldn't digest properly and the humidity on the other hand.</sentence><sentence id="680">So, by that time I already worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I realized that if I volunteer for the army I'll have rom and board after all and maybe, just maybe I'll be able to continue my studies because I knew by that time what the G.I. bill had been.</sentence><sentence id="681">What I didn't know was that it would take a long time before Congress would award the Korean veterans that same as World War II veterans because of political reasons the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was called police action and not war.</sentence><sentence id="682">But, in any event I then got caught in an incredible bureaucratic catch 22.</sentence><sentence id="683">The Air Force told me that I couldn't be accepted as a volunteer until I had my first papers.</sentence><sentence id="684">First papers meant the declaration of intention to become a U.S. citizen.</sentence><sentence id="685">It would take months before it would be processed bureaucratically and until then they couldn't accept me into the armed forces.</sentence><sentence id="686">So, I was willing to wait and one day when I came back -- I was renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for I think $6 a week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Hartford</span> in <span class="DLF">Beacon Street</span>, two elderly ladies who housed me.</sentence><sentence id="687">One day I came in and my land lady said you have "greetings" and I said from whom?And she said from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I found out that that meant a draft notice.</sentence><sentence id="688">It was called greetings.</sentence><sentence id="689">I said they can't draft me because I already volunteered to the air force and I ran to the captain and he then told me that was the catch 22.</sentence><sentence id="690">As a resident of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, one could be drafted at any time even a foreign student residing in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> could be drafted under the draft law, but to volunteer you have to have the declaration of intention to become a U.S. citizen which takes months.</sentence><sentence id="691">In any event, the army got me and I ended up in I think one of the most abominable divisions I think as far</sentence><sentence id="693">7 as treatment is concerned the 44th division part of Oklahoma National Guard where the cadre was what we called Oakies.</sentence><sentence id="694">There were policemen and all kinds of other men who felt that there would never be another war after World War II therefore they would get the income drink beer over the weekend and get some money for being in the National Guard.</sentence><sentence id="695">All of a sudden war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, they were federalized and there was something like 3,000 of them cadre and they had to find 10,000 cannon fodder meaning northern boys to become privates and all of them were upgraded and this as I found out they were taking out on us northerers still the vengefulness of the civil war.</sentence><sentence id="696">You know, the oakies finally have a chance to get Yankees and to tell them what to do.</sentence><sentence id="697">I went through some pretty hard times there.</sentence><sentence id="698">Once I was sent on shit detail for two weeks because I defended blacks in the division.</sentence><sentence id="699">When I was drafted into the U.S. Army in November of 1950, after very intensive basic training we had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to train on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hokaido</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">The Stars and Stripes wrote that in the entire history of the United States Army there hadn't been as intensive an infantry training as our division because in the wake of the initial American defeats when the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, when it turned out that the average American soldier was unprepared and unfit physically to negotiate all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> up and down, and up and down the terrain with backpacks, the Army was resolved on giving two divisions the 45th infantry Oklahoma National Guard and the 40th called the Sunburst of <span class="REGION">California</span> to give them the most intensive training.</sentence><sentence id="701">And it was one step from <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, the training.</sentence><sentence id="702">I then resolved that if I'm going to fight the war for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I might as well fight it and not get all the chicken feed from the tobacco chewing oakies as we called them and I volunteered for the front line service in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="703">Call it suicide instinct, whatever you wish, but I call it differently but that's for another</sentence><sentence id="705">8 time.</sentence><sentence id="706">Eventually in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> one year in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">battle zone</span>, there was some tough times.</sentence><sentence id="707">In fact there was a time with Oklahoma division on training where I seriously considered suicide because I just could not take the vicious handling by the southern non-coms who treated us northern gun fodder with utter contempt.</sentence><sentence id="708">This is also when I found out one more facet of true <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when in Oklahoma National Guard sergeant once came into our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and started -- drunken, started a whole tirade against blacks and there were some blacks that served in our divisions but troops were then still separated, and I opened my big mouth and I said well sergeant I'm serving this wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because I believe in it's principle of equality and justice and so on.</sentence><sentence id="709">Well, my punishment was two weeks on the shed detail, you know, <span class="DLF">digging ditches</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="710">So, I began to accumulate my treasury of the many facets of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> by that time.</sentence><sentence id="711">And when I served my time and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and applied for <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, I had to wait about nine months or so before the next school year, but I was accepted and eventually I had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">Yale Drama School</span> on three scholarships, the G.I. bill, small scholarship from the <span class="BUILDING">Polish National Home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span>, and after the first semester, a half tuition scholarship from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="712">Plus, waiting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>, the likes of Bill Lincoln and George Bush [?]</sentence><sentence id="713">had gone there probably just before me or certainly after me.</sentence><sentence id="714">Two hours a day to earn my three meals.</sentence><sentence id="715"><span class="DLF">Washing windows</span> during Easter vacation when my rich friends went off snowboarding or skiing or whatever, and driving a Good Humor ice cream truck in the summer to earn my keep for the next academic year.</sentence><sentence id="716">Eventually I married a local New Haven woman, with whom I have a grown daughter, Karen.</sentence><sentence id="717">I lived with her for three years, and she still didn't know my background.</sentence><sentence id="718">She thought I was Polish catholic, because everything else I was suppressing.</sentence><sentence id="719">Nobody at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yale</span> knew who I really was.</sentence><sentence id="722">9 Once I almost had a nervous breakdown because it seems that when I got close to someone I couldn't take even a small rejection.</sentence><sentence id="723">I thought I fell in love with a fellow student, but I think it was like a puppy love, and things functioned all right as long as I was like someone compared to driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, as long as you're moving and you work and you strive, you're okay.</sentence><sentence id="724">The minute the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> stops, you fall off.</sentence><sentence id="725">So, that when some feelings started developing toward the young woman I felt that if she didn't respond as much as I would want to emotionally, my whole world collapsed because I could not take what I thought was emotional rejection.</sentence><sentence id="726">No family, no friends, no one close, so that became very difficult to handle and it became a recurring pattern later on as well.</sentence><sentence id="727">In any event, when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after graduation something like A minus I guess, you call it with honors, I tried to get a job with CBS because the stage jobs that were available to me were not enough to support a wife and a young child.</sentence><sentence id="728">Among others I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> because at that time <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> was developing a lot of good drama, which is now almost gone practically gone.</sentence><sentence id="729"><span class="BUILDING">Studio One</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="730">The following incident I think is rather poignant.</sentence><sentence id="731">There was one man in the <span class="BUILDING">CBS television</span> by the name of Jim Levinthal who interviewed me.</sentence><sentence id="732">As I was hoping to get an entry while being a page at <span class="BUILDING">NBC</span> working the Steve Allen, the Tonight Show and so on, I think $44 a week as a uniform paid for by <span class="BUILDING">NBC</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">I had gone tosee Jim Levinthal at <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> two more times and at one point he said to me-- and he was in charge of hiring production assistants to become stage managers and directors, like John Frankheimer for example who had gone through that route.</sentence><sentence id="734">He asked me where did you say you came from and I said I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">He burst out and he said to me, "I'll be goddamn if I'm going to hire for the CBS program department, someone who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>."</sentence><sentence id="736">And that was that.</sentence><sentence id="737">Jim Levinthal obviously an</sentence><sentence id="739">0 American Jew and I was a Polish Jew and he turned me down because I had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">In this sense I suppose he reaffirmed his glorious American Jewish identity where he wouldn't hire someone who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="741">So much for that scene, and that <span class="DLF">route</span> was cut off.</sentence><sentence id="742">Eventually I got in through another <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">While I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">CBS</span> the first few years of course everybody knew me as a Polish catholic and that as that.</sentence><sentence id="744">My marriage was breaking up, and in "59 I was divorced and I was still with <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span>.</sentence><sentence id="745">About the time before the marriage was broke up after three years, I was driving from <span class="REGION">Hartford Connecticut</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mt. Vernon</span> New York, where I lived with my then family, and a passenger was a middle aged woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="746">She impressed me as having being made of an entirely different cloth.</sentence><sentence id="747">Tough and hard nosed and courageous and speaking of the new Israeli pioneer spirit although she introduced herself Polish Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="748">At one point she sat in the back, my wife next to me she fired a point blank question.</sentence><sentence id="749">Are you Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="750">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="751">Then I surprised myself.</sentence><sentence id="752">It was something in her demeanor, in her deportment that apparently got through to me.</sentence><sentence id="753">She then spent the night with us and one word led to another and it opened up a whole past life for my then wife who knew nothing about it.</sentence><sentence id="754">It was that woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who began to insist whether I had any relatives in the world, and I said that I understood that my father's brother who had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the 20s that he was here somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="755">She wanted to know why I wouldn't look him up and I said of course not.</sentence><sentence id="756">First of all, he wouldn't understand me.</sentence><sentence id="757">He would condemn me.</sentence><sentence id="758">Secondly, I have nothing to do with him.</sentence><sentence id="759">I never met him, and I have some questions to him if I met him which I don't want to, what was he doing when we were being "geharget" as they say in Yiddish, or exterminated and I don't want to go through the whole war time history with him because he would want it.</sentence><sentence id="760">She had</sentence><sentence id="762">1 undertaken upon herself to try to trace my uncle, my father's younger brother, and when she had made contact, she prevailed on me to meet him using every kind of appeal for me to consent.</sentence><sentence id="763">When I finally did, we made a date because my uncle lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mt. Vernon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">We made a date to meet at <span class="BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</span>, <span class="DLF">30 Rock Plaza</span>, as you walk in through the main <span class="DLF">door</span>, I remember, in the main <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span>, he described how he would look and Mrs. Bergman, the woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> accompanied me.</sentence><sentence id="765">At once we saw a little man, slim with an elderly woman apparently his wife.</sentence><sentence id="766">She approached him and confirmed his identity.</sentence><sentence id="767">He walked up to me -- that is my uncle, my closest living relative, 1959, which is 14 years after the war.</sentence><sentence id="768">He pulled me to the side, walked over toward the very corner of the <span class="DLF">marble wall</span> there, and said to me are you Joe, Yossl?</sentence><sentence id="769">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="770">He looked to me turned towards the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and started crying like a little baby.</sentence><sentence id="771">He couldn't say another word.</sentence><sentence id="772">It was I who had to gently pat him on the back and say Uncle Sam, all right, calm down now.</sentence><sentence id="773">I had to calm him down.</sentence><sentence id="774">Well, eventually I started visiting him and my marriage broke up, but shortly before it did, my wife started to persuade me to try to find out who I really am because I was between and betwixt.</sentence><sentence id="775">All of a sudden when that Pandora's box had been tapped I had no idea of who I was anymore, how I should act, what I should aim for and what my identity was etc.</sentence><sentence id="776">So, that my uncle -- through a ruse I found later, but through a ruse, made an appointment with me and a 16:14: Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span>, who then was the presiding Rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="777">It's a rotating function.</sentence><sentence id="778">Rabbi David Golemvenski, now deceased.</sentence><sentence id="779">Through a ruse because if my uncle would have asked me to see a Rabbi I would have turned him down.</sentence><sentence id="780">I would say I have nothing to do with a Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="781">I didn't even know one before the war in a Jewish family which was traditional but not very religious.</sentence><sentence id="782">But he used a rouse together with a</sentence><sentence id="784">2 rabbi I was told that the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center</span> needed a director to direct a play.</sentence><sentence id="785">That was the rouse.</sentence><sentence id="786">I said sure, okay.</sentence><sentence id="787">When I went there little by little, he was a rabbi in the U.S.Marine Corp and advisor in Jewish Affairs among others to President Roosevelt.</sentence><sentence id="788">A man very accomplished and very bright.</sentence><sentence id="789">Well, one word led to another and he started a series of conversations with me and once | opened up I started letting him have it.</sentence><sentence id="790">I said where were all the rabbis when we were being surrounded.</sentence><sentence id="791">Where were the rabbis when we had to reaffirm our national identity in the spirit of resistance they instead urged us not to offer any resistance because a good Jew doesn't she blood and so on.</sentence><sentence id="792">Where were all the rabbis that for two thousand years taught us passivity instead of reaffirmation of human dignity through resistance and so on.</sentence><sentence id="793">By the time that I started these conversations after I had met the rabbi once only I decided to seek out Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a national figure, like Reverend Robertson today or Billy Graham.</sentence><sentence id="794">Fulton Sheen as a bishop had a half hour show on t.v.</sentence><sentence id="795">nationwide and was an incredible speaker.</sentence><sentence id="796">So, I thought I would repair to him and seek his advice.</sentence><sentence id="797">I was in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on <span class="DLF">Muray Hill</span> a number of times, and we had many conversations and it was then that my uncle Sam said to me well, you're a rational man.</sentence><sentence id="798">You went to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>.</sentence><sentence id="799">Certainly why shouldn't you listen to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="800">I said sure it makes sense.</sentence><sentence id="801">And I started seeing Rabbi Golovensky.</sentence><sentence id="802">In the final analysis it didn't solve many of my problems of identity and the really point of explosion occurred when my uncle in about 1960 or so finally one day laid it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and said to honor my parents and to honor Jewish people in my heritage and so on, he says I had been baptized under duress as he called it and I called it not.</sentence><sentence id="803">I said it was of my own volition.</sentence><sentence id="804">He said well, what did you know you were 15 years old.</sentence><sentence id="805">You were frightened, you were terrified to death and the man was kind to you and told you there is</sentence><sentence id="807">3 another god who is more valid and so on and in the name of that god Jews had been murdered for centuries and in the name of Christ allegedly as Christ killers, the biggest lie in history.</sentence><sentence id="808">So, my uncle made me an ultimatum, in fact wrote me a letter which I believe I have to this day saying that I ought to publicly renounce catholicism and reconvert to be a Jew, possibly some kind of a mumbo jumbo ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="809">I said absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="810">Whatever happened, happened, and it happened because a magnificent young man, a priest, in the name of his god, but his god must be our god if we believe in unideism, or else nothing makes sense.</sentence><sentence id="811">In the name of the higher postulates of religion and human morality he risked his life because he 16:19: believes that love thy neighbor is the basic tenet.</sentence><sentence id="812">A man who did that for me in the name of his religion or call it is liturgy cannot be wrong, must be a worthy person and I am not going to spit him in the face and walk out on everything he taught me only because you who did nothing to save me want me to.</sentence><sentence id="813">We had a few very explosive conversations and it sent me into a long bout of depression.</sentence><sentence id="814">I believe at that point <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> has layoffs so the people with least seniority had to be laid off.</sentence><sentence id="815">As it turned out several months later they rehired me, but I already had a job with the U.N. then, and I was in the most abysmal state of depression.</sentence><sentence id="816">Again deserted, again alienated from everybody, again feeling myself deserted by my next of kin who said that if I don't reconvert he will condemn me and doesn't want to have anything to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="817">In one of the conversations I remember was rather explosive in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I asked him point blank, telling him that a decent Pole, a Christian with the help of a few other priests saved my life, risking it every minute of the day and I asked him at one point, what did you do Uncle Sam to save your own family at the time when strangers were saving Jews lives?</sentence><sentence id="818">What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="819">And he started</sentence><sentence id="821">4 giving me what I call etcha petcha metcha, which means well you know there was some anti-semitism and there were the German Bund here and it wasn't so easy, and I said did you chain yourself to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> as a protest because your brother and you family was being exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="822">If you didn't you have no right to tell me how to live my life, and what friend to honor, and whom to be loyal to.</sentence><sentence id="823">So, the following period, if I remember, about two years where I had nothing to do with him or his wife.</sentence><sentence id="824">And I was told in retrospect that he couldn't sleep nights.</sentence><sentence id="825">That he was crying and so on, but what I felt all along would happen that sooner or later if not my uncle then someone else would condemn me a traitor to the Jewish race because I was baptized.</sentence><sentence id="826">Along in about 1962, by pure chance I had walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yivo</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Historical Institute</span> because Rabbi Golvensky felt and insisted that I ought to go.</sentence><sentence id="827">There may be a photograph or maybe something of my family of my past because I had nothing to reestablish the link with my past and to his credit he insisted and pressed me.</sentence><sentence id="828">So, I did, and when I walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yivo</span>, and said who I was, my original name, there still was on the staff the few survivors who of course knew music and culture in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and a man by the name of Finklestein immediately popped and said of course I knew your father.</sentence><sentence id="829">I said to myself, yes, a lot of people say they know my father like a lot of people know the pope, or Lenny Bernstein but does he know everyone.</sentence><sentence id="830">I was used to that by the way.</sentence><sentence id="831">When I was a child everybody said I know your father and it turned out my father didn't even know the man.</sentence><sentence id="832">So, within minutes he called from upstairs, as it turned out a revered, gentleman by the name of Jonas Turkow, a famous Polish actor and director before World War II, who as it turned out was a friend a my father was with my father in the committee for underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="833">His wife was the famous Diana Blumenthal, a chanteuse for</sentence><sentence id="835">5 whom my father wrote songs at one time, and he came down when I was introduced.</sentence><sentence id="836">Finklestein said this is Joseph Fajwiszys, he said you are little Joe?</sentence><sentence id="837">I said, yes I guess so.</sentence><sentence id="838">Well, that's when the next chapter in my long track to reestablish my roots so to speak had begun.</sentence><sentence id="839">Because Ilu Turkow then had me in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and with his wife Diana Blumenthal showed me a handwritten song my father wrote once for his wife which he buried in a can in the Warsaw Ghetto ruins before he managed to scale the <span class="DLF">wall</span> posing as a Polish railroad man and found it after the war.</sentence><sentence id="840">He gave me and I still have it, anda long, long conversation started with a man whose daughter, herself, had been given over to Christians and when he survived the war his daughter who by then was eight or nine was saying oh those goddamn Jews, was inbued with anti-semitism by the very people to whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter.</sentence><sentence id="841">So, his daughter also had a very difficult <span class="DLF">road</span> back but at least had the original father and mother and so on, and still I understand as of a few years ago, she's not in very good shape mentally.</sentence><sentence id="842">Well, Turkoff as if he had found his own son.</sentence><sentence id="843">This went on for a number of months.</sentence><sentence id="844">I came to respect him and regard him highly because he had no religious ax to grind.</sentence><sentence id="845">He was just a man of culture.</sentence><sentence id="846">A man of tradition but progressive and so on.</sentence><sentence id="847">And one day, he told me that a man had visited him who was in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and that he would like to start an organization that had something to do with those who were in the resistance movement in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and wanted me to be part of it.</sentence><sentence id="848">I had grave scruples.</sentence><sentence id="849">I didn't want to do anything about it, but more and more he appealed to my conscience and the rest is history, because the few of us that's Jack Eisner, Jonas Stutkoff, Bob Bjorn and Joe Tulesky, Latka Meed and myself, formed an organization that we didn't know for weeks how to call it.</sentence><sentence id="850">Finally I came up with the acronym WAGRO, Warsaw Ghetto Resistance</sentence><sentence id="852">6 Organization and I threw myself into that work, even though I was with <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="853">We wanted to among other things, the objectives we discussed but then I wrote them the final version and they're still everyday at <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> it's all there, it's all my language among other things is to build a memorial to Warsaw Ghetto heroes in <span

roots which goes back to "59 and "62, it's been now over 30 years of intermittent, at time tortuous, inner life, except that I no longer am hiding -- parts of me are still hiding, but by and large I'm not.</sentence><sentence id="1139">A cynic might say it comes with age because the closer we are to the end of our life we care less about when it might start all over again and from history we know that the ways of persecution of Jews and we see in the world today where other minorities are occasionally being exterminated by others.</sentence><sentence id="1140">You don't have to be Jewish to be a Biafran, Nigerian, Bosnian and Serbian, and so on and so on, but you begin to care less and less about survival at any cost.</sentence><sentence id="1141">Now it matters, survival with integrity.</sentence><sentence id="1142">As I was construing my integrity way back then, I felt that and I've been throughout my childhood that any Jew who would convert is a traitor to the nation, and I believed it because what else was I to believe except everything I was taught.</sentence><sentence id="1143">Eventually through the shock of the selections and the extermination phase when I was desperate and destitute and a young priest put his life on the line for me, but also taught me a great many things which I had not been taught in my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1144">I was taught a few prayers, just mumbling them in order to satisfy one class in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and that was the end of it.</sentence><sentence id="1145">I had been to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> maybe two three times a year on the high holidays because my father felt that he ought to put in an appearance and occasionally he conducted a 12 voice choir or played the philharmonia which was sort of like an organ.</sentence><sentence id="1146">But it had been inbuted in me that throughout that a Jew who is baptized and is converted is a traitor to his nation.</sentence><sentence id="1147">He does it only for self advancement or for other commercial reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1148">That is why I felt that when I was baptized by the priest and I remember once he</sentence><sentence id="1150">9 told me that it would be interesting to know if I would hold faith with the truth as he taught me in addition to love thy neighbor of which he was the best exemplified tenet, but also about Christ and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1151">He said at one point it would be interesting to know that when the war was over if I would keep faith, because he says throughout centuries Jews converted in order to survive when it was more convenient and when the threat was no longer there they reconverted as he said a Jew will always be a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1152">I was determined to prove to him as I construed my integrity that that was not so, that I would be faithful to the faith as he taught me.</sentence><sentence id="1153">That I would not change 180 degrees the minute it was convenient to me and the minute that was over that I could get help from Jewish organizations.</sentence><sentence id="1154">In fact I had never gone to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish organization</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on my own, worked on a <span class="DLF">tobacco

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1182">Q: Is religion a contract or is simply a belief?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1184">A: Being in contact with Father Furkosksy for the last 50 years, I was guilty of not answering his letters sometimes for a year or longer, but he never got angry.</sentence><sentence id="1185">He always wrote again and again with love and compassion and understanding until we had our first</sentence><sentence id="1187">0 reunion and second and then later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when he was decorated and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1188">But there were long periods when I didn't see contact with him because I felt I would have to live up to what he expected me, and I found that I progressively could not.</sentence><sentence id="1189">I could not live a chaste life.</sentence><sentence id="1190">As I told him once that without a love of a woman, I don't want to live in this world.</sentence><sentence id="1191">He said he could understand that, that I had to get to the bottom of the few reasons for the persecution of Jews as he had implanted in me.</sentence><sentence id="1192">That resulted eventually in a film that I was prevailed upon to do, namely Children in the Holocaust that nearly devastated me.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I just couldn't sleep nights and so on and going to ten <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and listening to stories of some of the survivors that I couldn't even imagine that such plight existed in other cases.</sentence><sentence id="1194">And throughout it all I had to find myself.</sentence><sentence id="1195">Myself meaning that at one point I read all the four epistles from beginning to end and I immersed myself in books on the sources of anti-semitism and by omission and commission and by hiding by running away by struggling over many years, I have finally reached what I believe is going to stay with me and stick with me and that's me.</sentence><sentence id="1196">That's only in the last few recent years.</sentence><sentence id="1197">What is me, first of all.</sentence><sentence id="1198">I am who I am in terms of my birth, my roots, my heritage.</sentence><sentence id="1199">There's no getting away from that.</sentence><sentence id="1200">I am proud of it as much as an Irishman is proud to be Irish and a Pole is proud to be Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1201">No more and no less.</sentence><sentence id="1202">I condemn and have so done in articles and speeches that I have made.</sentence><sentence id="1203">People no matter what their ethnic grouping is, Jews or non Jews who look for a scape goat.</sentence><sentence id="1204">Anti-semites look for Jews as scapegoats when the economy is down and they say it's all the faults of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1205">Jews when they feel empowered find a scapegoat in others.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Whether they be certain degrees of second citizenship among Palestinians, and I'm not a utopian and I know the reality and self preservation, or for many years claiming that all Poles are</sentence><sentence id="1208">1 anti-semites, which is equally untrue.</sentence><sentence id="1209">Because according to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad va Shem</span> 37 percent of all righteous Christians honored were Poles.</sentence><sentence id="1210">There are Jewish circles who condemn Poles for anti- semitism simply because it is now more convenient because there are now until at least recently they were more helpless than the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1211">The same Jews who go to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or receive pension checks from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> do not attack Germans en bloc but they do attack Poles en bloc, meaning that there are some absolutely undeniable facts.</sentence><sentence id="1212">The undeniable facts are the holocaust, the Nazi extermination and their collaborators.</sentence><sentence id="1213">That is absolutely undeniable.</sentence><sentence id="1214">It is also undeniable that among other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> there were victims who were tortured because of the nationalism, because they saved others, a few hundred Polish priests and nuns were executed because they sheltered the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1215">That cannot be shoved under the rug either.</sentence><sentence id="1216">We Jews do not have the license to righteousness only or to suffering.</sentence><sentence id="1217">We must continuously also honor those who were tortured by dictatorship and Nazism and continuously uphold as role models those who risked their lives to save many of us.</sentence><sentence id="1218">So, who am I?</sentence><sentence id="1219">I'ma Jew and a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="1220">I'm also an American citizen and I hope a very loyal one.</sentence><sentence id="1221">But anybody who would want to press further be they a scientist or a common Yente would want the question between diverse would always be no, so who are you?</sentence><sentence id="1222">So, do you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or do you believe in Jesus Christ?</sentence><sentence id="1223">My first answer is non of your goddamn business.</sentence><sentence id="1224">What I do in private is my own self -- my own business as long as I don't deny who I am and whether I am more comfortable to walk into <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, that's my own business.</sentence><sentence id="1225">Now, for posterity and for the sake of bearing witness and making a record, do I believe in Jesus Christ because it all comes down to that right, sooner or later, right.</sentence><sentence id="1226">Either you do or you don't.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Either you go right or you go left, said Mengele, right?</sentence><sentence id="1228">First of all, I don't agree</sentence><sentence id="1230">2 with that kind of a Nazi theory that I owe it to anybody, to anybody in the world, to publicly identify myself with this or with that.</sentence><sentence id="1231">Having said that, my personal belief to this day is do I believe in God?</sentence><sentence id="1232">Sometimes yes, sometimes not.</sentence><sentence id="1233">I believe that if he's omnipotent, he must have been on vacation for a very long time.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I think I'm familiar with almost every dogmatic or <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, dogmatic possible answer to the 17:15: question.</sentence><sentence id="1235">Well, God had simply set these things in mechanism but he gave us free will and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1236">I am familiar with every one of these postulates because I've been taught and I discussed it with my priest and with others.</sentence><sentence id="1237">Recently with a father professor of the <span class="BUILDING">catholic university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> who was here.</sentence><sentence id="1238">We had hours of conversation.</sentence><sentence id="1239">So, do I believe in God?Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't.</sentence><sentence id="1240">Do I believe in Jesus Christ?</sentence><sentence id="1241">From every historical bit if evidence, there was such a man who lived and such man must have been a role model along with several others throughout the ages for humanity to pursue possibly never to attain, because who's willing to just abscond everything and just put on a sack and eschew all the riches of the world etc, etc.</sentence><sentence id="1242">Since such men lived, and expounded all the goodness and all the mercy, this to me along with some other somewhat antiquated wise sayings from the bible and the koran and whatever constitutes the essence of human ethics and morality but advanced one or two steps more.</sentence><sentence id="1243">Meaning, that goodness and love they neighbor is no longer the province of Jews toward fellow Jews but anyone is my neighbor, anyone is.</sentence><sentence id="1244">If that had not been taken seriously by my savior, my priest, and thousands of others like him, I wouldn't be here to talk to you, and the last vestiges of morality and ethics expounded by the three major religions would be gone, even though they collapsed long ago in Europe which has fought catholic and protestant one another.</sentence><sentence id="1245">So, that if Jesus Christ expounded these ideals in the name of which people are willing</sentence><sentence id="1247">3 risk their lives to serve their neighbor, a stranger, these are some of the highest ideals in the world.</sentence><sentence id="1248">Now, to go to one step further to the ultimate level, do you believe he was a god?</sentence><sentence id="1249">Well, there are theologians to this day who are not sure, protestant and catholic.</sentence><sentence id="1250">I read all 17:18: four epistles cover to cover to this day, and I don't see anywhere Christ saying I am God.</sentence><sentence id="1251">He said I am the son of God, but in the next chapter, another evangelist or he himself says, we are all children of God, so to claim the deity of God, the immaculate conception of Virgin Mary which some protestant reject also can go on and go on.</sentence><sentence id="1252">In the final analysis who do I pray to?</sentence><sentence id="1253">None of your goddamn business.</sentence><sentence id="1254">I pray when I pray to God whenever I have hopes that he exists and not that he owes me a lot, but I think he owes all of us a lot in order to justify the innocent slaughter of children, millions of them in the world, to this day.</sentence><sentence id="1255">But if there is some kind of a mechanism that I don't understand, then I'm willing to say well I don't understand that and in times when I must clutch onto something, and if I believe that there is a god, yes, sometimes I pray to him.</sentence><sentence id="1256">What I say to him is between him and me.</sentence><sentence id="1257">I own no accounting to anyone else, possibly to the man who saved my life, but then he and I we have our own way of communicating.</sentence><sentence id="1258">We understand each other.</sentence></p></dialogue>

neighbor, murdering Jews which is the most advanced lie and bigotry in the world.</sentence><sentence id="1444">But I do believe</sentence><sentence id="1446">7 that the way of making ethics and

question as to what have been the after effects and the consequences of all these experiences, well it's like trying to reduce Homer's odyssey down to one paragraph.</sentence><sentence id="1449">One can do it only with sufficient distance, and I think now after some 50 years I think I have achieved sufficient distance.</sentence><sentence id="1450">In my case first of all for many years I had to play many roles.</sentence><sentence id="1451">It's like the seven ages of man from Shakespeare.</sentence><sentence id="1452">Until and only recently I stopped playing roles.</sentence><sentence id="1453">In other words, I would bend my behavior to what I felt I should sound like, speak like, behave and what my attitudes should be to one person versus another person depending on who they were, Americans, Poles, Jews, etc.</sentence><sentence id="1454">So, I played various roles.</sentence><sentence id="1455">That eventually resulted in not only dichotomy, but in some self loathing as to who I am.</sentence><sentence id="1456">That has been the easier part.</sentence><sentence id="1457">More difficult part that caused me incessant inner torture and suffering and 18:03: struggling has been the alienation for most of my life from most people.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So, with the result that I don't trust most people anyway, and the few instances that someone appeals to me, I tend to go overboard, meaning that I try to make up for what I lost in growing up, in the love of father, mother, sister, relatives, teachers, peers and so on, and become periodically over enthusiastic and overtrusting until I get disappointed but that began to level itself off with age.</sentence><sentence id="1459">So, I am absolutely convinced that my one great regret is that if I didn't have these crippling problems of running away, of alienation of avoiding deeper relationships, that I could have achieved much more than I have, and to some degree I have achieved what I was able to do, but in spite of my problems and difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Three university diplomas and a stint on broadway, starting my own <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="1461">etc, the rest is in Who's Who in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but I'm still extremely</sentence><sentence id="1463">8 dissatisfied with myself because I think I could have and should have achieved more.</sentence><sentence id="1464">When I would go on vacation for example with my second wife who told me that I was the biggest pain in the neck when I was on vacation because within a day or two I was already restless and wanting to get back to start another project or get back to work.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I simply could not enjoy vacation because I think deep down I felt that I had no right to just be merry and mirthful and enjoy myself while all my people had been exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="1466">It's a sense of guilt that every day that I get up that I don't further the cause of either bearing witness or creating yet another project and justify my survival.</sentence><sentence id="1467">Whatever I have accomplished which by some measure is little, and by other point of view may be I suppose of note, has happened despite great many personal problems in relating to people.</sentence><sentence id="1468">For example, when I was with <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> and case in point when I worked with Don Hewitt who is now a big celebrity, creator of 60 minutes etc.,</sentence><sentence id="1469">this is just a case in point, not to appear on Entertainment Tonight, but I know that I could have easily been one of the producers or directors on 60 minutes or soap operas or whatever and I have worked against myself a critic might say in that when I felt for example that on a soap opera that the values were trite, that they were mundane, that they were exploitive, I had such contempt for the people who in view of everything that has happened to this world and to me personally and to holocaust and all of that, that these people could still deal with these trite and superficial problems instead of delving deeper into the human conditions for the edification of themselves and others, that I literally had contempt for those values and I'm sure that I've shown it and said so a number of times.</sentence><sentence id="1470">Well, that's why I'm not a producer or a director on a soap opera making a quarter million dollars a year today, but it doesn't</sentence><sentence id="1472">9 matter to me because I would spitting in my face if I build my life around these trite values.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1509">Q: Do you have the right to enjoy yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1511">A: To me enjoyment is even with no holocaust but simply responding to my education in the European condition in my <span class="DLF">field</span> which has been theater and lately expanded into television maybe film, that simply is being faithful to my profession.</sentence><sentence id="1512">A doctor considers his calling, if he's a good doctor, to treat others and prevent suffering and pain.</sentence><sentence id="1513">Well, being in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> from which I have emerged professionally, my calling is to examine the human condition, sometimes through laughter, often seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1514">But 18:09: the triteness and the superficiality that I find in the <span class="DLF">commercial field</span> to me is repugnant.</sentence><sentence id="1515">It's a violation of every - - it's the same way that a doctor would work only to push as much penicillin or aspirin as he possibly can only to enrich himself, you know just push prescriptions.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1527">Q: Simple pleasures?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1533">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1534">But to go off on vacation for more than a few days, I feel guilty and I feel that I am not doing something worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="1535">You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy Jewish rights.</sentence><sentence id="1536">You don't have to live through the Holocaust to be committed to some deeper values and the calling of the profession.</sentence><sentence id="1537">But I think it's only been exacerbated by my experiences because I think that I ought to do something meaningful all the time to justify my survival and in that sense I'm not the ideal person to live with and only think of what fun to dedicate myself to after working hours.</sentence><sentence id="1538">And for many, many years having lost my family, having lived in so much fear and terror, having felt myself abandoned by my family, by Jews, by the rest of the world, it was probably inevitable that in personal relationships for many years, I would construe a small slight as a rejection and then respond in kind by either more forceful repartee or by running away.</sentence><sentence id="1539">In other words, terminating a relationship, and this has haunted me for many, many years.</sentence><sentence id="1540">Until by the time I was able to gain an insightful look into it, I was getting older.</sentence><sentence id="1541">So, that's been the other after affect but it's like saying someone what is it like giving birth to a child.</sentence><sentence id="1542">You can understand it intellectually, but unless you've gone through all the trepidations and the enormous pain, you don't really understand it.</sentence><sentence id="1543">So, you can talk 18:12: about these things, but to have lived through the constant terror first to survive, and then to protect what you construed was your integrity but in fact was a false identity and live in terror of being unmasked.</sentence><sentence id="1544">Because if I was unmasked then I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn.</sentence><sentence id="1545">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn.</sentence><sentence id="1546">There was no going back and thee was no going forward, so I had to protect that carefully constructed false identity and I think this has been the greatest curse of the after affects. [</sentence><sentence id="1547">PAUSE] Well, there is, as you probably know a film made by a Kibbutz Lokhamei Hagettaoth in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> some 20 years ago called the 29th blow or 49th Blow or</sentence><sentence id="1549">1 something.</sentence><sentence id="1550">That is somewhat a dramatic of my approach, the conclusion of that film.</sentence><sentence id="1551">In other words, there was a survivor who somehow lived through some 27 blows being whipped by SS or by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1552">But the worst, the 28th blow was after the war when he had found out that the world was so little interested in what he had to say.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I remember when we established the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization in 1962 and wanted to come out with the first commemoration ever of the Warsaw Ghetto heroes that we couldn't find one Jewish community group or one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the greater <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> would give us a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> free of charge in which to hold the commemoration.</sentence><sentence id="1554">This was before it became fashionable to attache yourself in more ways than one, socially, economically, financially, status wise to the word holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1555">And sooner or later of course it is fall into the hands of the establishment or people who have either economic ax to grind or want to enrich themselves by publishing this or that.</sentence><sentence id="1556">And that hurts but I suppose that is inevitable, and so we are the last dying breed because when the war broke out I was 11 which means I was old enough to remember what was going and young enough to attain my present age and talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1557">But with my generation when we begin dying out that is the end of those who will bear witness, and then what hurts is that it will fall into the 18:16: hands of the interpreters, the revisionists, even the honest revisionists who are going to place this or that emphasis because they will have their own ax to grind.</sentence><sentence id="1558">When you watch a play or a film called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rashomon</span> when a woman was violated and there were three or four different versions of those who were present.</sentence><sentence id="1559">Each had a different version, then you begin to take the so called holy scriptures, including the epistles, with a grain of salt because unless every word had been guided by the spirit of God and that has to be proven as I know the scientific formula for approving the spirits.</sentence><sentence id="1560">Whether to what</sentence><sentence id="1562">2 degree we can trust what will be the witness that will be borne, we have fortunately ways of recording testimonies which we didn't have 2,000 years ago or more, and maybe for that reason it will be somewhat better preserved.</sentence><sentence id="1563">But what hurts more than anything is that what happened to our generation will not be properly understood or acted upon and what hurts even more so is that from what I see the world has not learned and the same thing 18:18: is liable to occur again and again.</sentence><sentence id="1564">I don't know what else to say.</sentence><sentence id="1565">I don't want to say empty phrases.</sentence><sentence id="1566">This is a picture about six months old 1927 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> of Joseph Kutrzeba born as Josef Arye Fajwiszys about six months old on a bear skin as was then a habit of placing infants on.</sentence><sentence id="1567">This is my father Professor Israel Fajwiszys approximately 1921 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> pre- war Poland, now <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, born in 1887 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yampol</span> which was <span class="REGION">extreme eastern Poland</span> prior to 1939 but at the time of his birth was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">Well, left to right, a chart whose identity I don't know because I got these pictures after the war, next to him I believe is my father's mother or my grandmother whom I never met.</sentence><sentence id="1569">Standing next to her is my mother Malka Fajwiszys, maiden name Hakman, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czer</span>.....?</sentence><sentence id="1570"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, I believe it was 1902.</sentence><sentence id="1572">Standing next to her is my father Professor Israel Fajwiszys and then in the woman's lap is my sister Perla age two which was about two years before I was planned and next to her I believe was my mother's sister or cousin, I'm not sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>

hour prior to the picture being taken I remember, and finally my father had to quiet me down because prior to going to the photographer I had been saving money in my little savings box for about a
