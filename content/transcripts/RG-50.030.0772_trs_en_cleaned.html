<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1962">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1964">A: They have a very won -- they had a wonderful -- well, they still have a wonderful annual event where they have the old <span

got -- both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a--a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, really.</sentence><sentence id="1971">But we -- none of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> came up for sale that we could -- could ha -- could handle.</sentence><sentence id="1972">So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back -- I started making designs for <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1973">And, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span> they had all -- had all kinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1974">So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the -- the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build.</sentence><sentence id="1975">Showed it to him, he said, oh, that's a nice little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> Bill, but that -- that's -- that would look beautiful in <span class="REGION">Lancaster County</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, but that's not for Waterford.</sentence><sentence id="1976">So I went back, and I designed a brick

house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1979">Not for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1980">So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the "Washington Post," and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for sale.</sentence><sentence id="1981">They were tearing down a <span class="BUILDING">log house</span> because they built -- had new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> all around it, they -- they couldn't do anything except tear -- tear down and move it.</sentence><sentence id="1982">So we went over -- she said, let's go over and take a look at it.</sentence><sentence id="1983">Well, that was the first week in May, 1970.</sentence><sentence id="1984">And I said, oh, I'm too busy, I can't take -- make it.</sentence><sentence id="1985">So next week she tried again.</sentence><sentence id="1986">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was still for sale.</sentence><sentence id="1987">Third</sentence><sentence id="1989">"a February 21, 2014 week, still for sale, tried again.</sentence><sentence id="1990">The fourth week, Sunday -- Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out.</sentence><sentence id="1991">Said okay, let's take the kids over, we'll go look at it.</sentence><sentence id="1992">So we went over and there's this <span

everything.</sentence><sentence id="1994">We opened the <span class="DLF">back door</span>, and the inside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had been lone -- had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board?</sentence><sentence id="1995">And when we opened the <span class="DLF">back door</span> there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down.</sentence><sentence id="1996">But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs.</sentence><sentence id="1997">And it was in good shape.</sentence><sentence id="1998">Only two logs needed some -- some moderate repairs.</sentence><sentence id="1999">So right there we bought the <span class="BUILDING">log house</span>, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our <span class="DLF">lot</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span> so we could rebuild it.</sentence><sentence id="2000">And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father's got a <span class="BUILDING">log house</span> three miles over there, that he hasn't used for 10 years, he'd probably sell that to you, if you wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="2001">So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waterford</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2002">And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975.</sentence><sentence id="2003">And we had -- still had <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> missing, and no <span class="DLF">doors</span> or <span class="DLF">windows</span> installed, things like that, but we moved in in time for the kids to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the</sentence><sentence id="2005">6s February 21, 2014 fall, and then I built it up from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2006">So that's how -- that's how we got into
