<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="890">Q: What was it like going in with no lights?</sentence><sentence id="891">How did you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: Scared.</sentence><sentence id="895">But uh send a prayer upwards.</sentence><sentence id="896">At that time that was one of the last uh chance for the Jewish refugees but we were so used to uh this procedure that normally it was calm and it choose to be the same thing now.</sentence><sentence id="897">There was no problem at all.</sentence><sentence id="898">Only that one had forgotten to do what he had to do.</sentence><sentence id="899">But. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: How did your captain find his way in without lights?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: Well, we have in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> uh pilots of course, but then we had people which we called "men who knows" and that's people who know that exactly part of the the <span class="DLF">border</span>, of the of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and uh it's so in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in the straits that the sand reefs, there are some <span class="DLF">sand reefs</span>, that they are shifting every year.</sentence><sentence id="909">But if you know them you can go from one <span class="DLF">reef</span> through a <span class="DLF">hole</span> into another and then you should be a man who knows the way to do it all as people they would drown.</sentence><sentence id="910">And uh the captain knew the thing.</sentence><sentence id="911">He knew every inch of the uh <span class="DLF">beach</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> outside.</sentence><sentence id="912">It's interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="918">Q: You're going in.</sentence><sentence id="919">Your lights had failed.</sentence><sentence id="920">Your signals had failed.</sentence><sentence id="921">If you were caught, did you have guns to defend yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="927">We never had a gun.</sentence><sentence id="928">We don't think it could help anything.</sentence><sentence id="929">Uh we couldn't resist uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German patrol</span> and we had also the security of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> to think of.</sentence><sentence id="930">So we never had a gun.</sentence><sentence id="931">It was a gunless army. .</sentence><sentence id="932">I think that that shows that sometimes you can win victory without arms.</sentence><sentence id="933">I think that's important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: You mentioned earlier too that being without guns, that would get you a different sentence than if you had guns if you were caught?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="944">A: Yes, in that time there would be, if you were caught with a gun, you had the risk to have the death penalty.</sentence><sentence id="945">Otherwise you will shot, maybe shot at sight, but uh if you were caught without guns and then you'll get a long term death penalty, be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> but OK, there was a very much better chance, and at that time uh we, the most of the Danish uh resistance movement caught would be sent uh to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> just north of the German<span class="DLF">-Danish border</span> where the conditions were some better, oh no, much 5 better than in a, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">So there was really difference if you were taken with guns, explosives - then that would be a death penalty, but we had no use of them.</sentence><sentence id="947">We shouldn't catch fish with the guns.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: When you were going in, and the signals had failed, did your passengers know about this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="954">A: No, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="955">We were alone.</sentence><sentence id="956">We were on the way in after coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="957">No, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="966">Describe for me the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, how they reacted.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: Well, I really think they reacted what everybody can expect.</sentence><sentence id="968">Somebody are calm.</sentence><sentence id="969">Somebody are very uneasy.</sentence><sentence id="970">Some have children with them and they had a double responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="971">They are much more afraid and but normally, and I know it from uh and Thormod Larson who have done it many many times, they said that it was remarkable peace, remarkable calm on the most, of the, from the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> most time.</sentence><sentence id="972">There was very seldom that some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> would do anything.</sentence><sentence id="973">Because they understand that's their last chance.</sentence><sentence id="974">And that was the last attempt in their uh way from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="975">And I really think they were very calm in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> also when we started.</sentence><sentence id="976">And very much joy there too when when we said now we're on the right side of the strait.</sentence><sentence id="977">That was a relief and that, that was in my -I understood it.</sentence><sentence id="978">I understood it.</sentence><sentence id="979">But uh there was never the disorder or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="980">No.</sentence><sentence id="981">But some of them, they had I suppose a out.</sentence><sentence id="982">And maybe also to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
