were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and for the winter months, sometimes we were allowed to...uh...g0 <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we lived there.</sentence><sentence id="905">Now what happened for instance, I can tell you one interesting thing about 1941 if we have time.</sentence><sentence id="906">In 1941, my sister-in-law who lived in <span

told you before, the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> was a very narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> and because people were pouring out and would have been in danger, endangered each other, so he was...he and other 10 people were there and he was in charge of that group of policeman.</sentence><sentence id="942">So he knew me very well.</sentence><sentence id="943">And this while he was running back and forth, and at the third or fourth try, the lieutenant told him, "Put him aside.</sentence><sentence id="944">Stand him...let him stand aside."</sentence><sentence id="945">This saved our lives because Hortee (pause - drinking water) Hortee then called off the killing, and this is when it stopped at our .</sentence><sentence id="946">So if anyone will tell me this story, I wouldn't
