<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="654">Q: Can you describe...tell me what that <span class="INT_SPACE">underground bunker</span> looked like.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="656">A: (Chuckle) It was...it was...uh...under these...these workshop.</sentence><sentence id="657">And they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> there to make papers, you know, government papers like...like...like...uh...like false... uh...uh...false papers.</sentence><sentence id="658">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="659">Identifications and... and even passports we made there.</sentence><sentence id="660">But..uh...uh...all kind of papers, everything we were...made there.</sentence><sentence id="661">And we had draftsmen who were...who

partisans and to people who were hiding, ...these papers.</sentence><sentence id="664">Now one day there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="665">So one friend with me, we knew from our experience of working there on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> that there was a old <span class="DLF">water reservoir</span>...uh...that was not used.</sentence><sentence id="666">So that had a <span class="DLF">manhole</span> on top.</sentence><sentence id="667">That's all what it was.</sentence><sentence id="668">A <span class="DLF">manhole</span>, so we could open the <span class="DLF">manhole</span> and climb into that <span class="DLF">water reservoir</span> and we were hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="669">And we had a...uh...I had a cousin, a girl cousin, Gerty Schweigger, she was bringing us the food every night.</sentence><sentence id="670">Only by night we could get out.</sentence><sentence id="671">Because what happened that <span class="NPIP">place</span> had a...had a...uh...whole unit of German army there during that time already located.</sentence><sentence id="672">They confiscated...that was a...a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span>...a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> from a old lady, a countess.</sentence><sentence id="673">They confiscated it for the German

took...took that...uh...<span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">But that was a ideal hiding place, this whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> because everybody knew that

id="679"><span class="BUILDING">Hiding</span>.</sentence><sentence id="680">They didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="681">They didn't care about nothing.</sentence><sentence id="682">Only like army, you know.</sentence><sentence id="683">So that was for awhile we could do that.</sentence><sentence id="684">And afterwards...uh...I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="685">My...my parents...there was...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> already going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="686">My

awhile safe.</sentence><sentence id="691">And then it started...uh...that these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and I told them, "You better hide somewhere because that will not go forever like this.</sentence><sentence id="692">You will not be able to keep it."</sentence><sentence id="693">We were all concentrated already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">Yah.</sentence><sentence id="695">A long time we had to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, all the Jews, so they had us already concentrated there.</sentence><sentence id="696">Uh...My mother didn't want to hide.</sentence><sentence id="697">My father wanted to hide in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="698">He had friends between the peasants and they would have hidden us, but my...my mother didn't want to go because the relatives were very prominent Jews in <span

to hiding.</sentence><sentence id="700">They will know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="701">They will protect us.</sentence><sentence id="702">But it didn't come out so.</sentence><sentence id="703">They were not protecting nobody.</sentence><sentence id="704">Nobody was protected.</sentence><sentence id="705">So I was hiding already.</sentence><sentence id="706">I was underground on the...in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">It was a fancy, fancy one, a old fancy one, like a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span>.</sentence><sentence

uh ... if they would know.</sentence><sentence id="715">So we were hiding there...about three or four Jewish boys with...with false papers.</sentence><sentence id="716">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="717">But I couldn't sit all day long <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="718">So one day I was going out.</sentence><sentence id="719">I was always going where big crowds were.</sentence><sentence id="720">There was a <span class="DLF">road</span> not far from us... uh... uh... uh... <span class="DLF">street</span>, the <span class="DLF">shopping street</span> where all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were and <span class="DLF">windows</span> so there would always be crowd so I always blended there in...in the crowds, hopeful that nobody is going

id="726">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="727">And I go to him, and that was my downfall because what I found out later...I didn't know at that time.</sentence><sentence id="728">But later I found out that he was caught by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="729">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="730">And to get out from the Gestapo to be still alive, they told him they can do it only if he brings

get better food because when you work you have to get food.</sentence><sentence id="1321">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="1322">So really they took us out one...but first of all the <span

id="1347">And they had maybe a opportunity to go even out from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1348">That was really privileged people.</sentence><sentence id="1349">A handful.</sentence><sentence id="1350">It was a small Lager with families and so on, and very, very prominent people and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1351">But I was just a plain schnook

terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1357">The food just to survive that.</sentence><sentence id="1358">A lot of people were dying there because they were already weak anyway and they didn't have food.</sentence><sentence id="1359">So a lot of people there dying there already.</sentence><sentence id="1360">I discovered there a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="1361">He was already on the

anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1371">He wanted to die.</sentence><sentence id="1372">He wanted to die.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And so...but I didn't want to die.</sentence><sentence id="1374">I had the survival instinct.</sentence><sentence id="1375">No matter what, I had to live.</sentence><sentence id="1376">So what happened?</sentence><sentence id="1377">They were bringing

a vegetable soup.</sentence><sentence id="1384">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="1385">But better than nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1386">What...what they did, on the way to...to where... where they were supposed to hand out the food, they stole one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span>, so there were one container less and they knew...knew that will not be enough.</sentence><sentence id="1387">They stole it and they sold it for money or...or...or gold to some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, some...some other prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1388">I don't know where.</sentence><sentence id="1389">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="1390">And so what they did, they put down these...these two container and told...told everybody, "Get it

because everybody was fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1393">So they tipped over the whole container on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and who is going to eat it from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, cold and everything?</sentence><sentence id="1394">Yah?</sentence><sentence id="1395">And that was the only food what we got!</sentence><sentence id="1396">So what I did, just thinking for survival.</sentence><sentence id="1397">What I did, I picked up the vegetable, the cold vegetables from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">barrack room</span> and washed the whole vegetables and everything under the water pipe and ate it cold, whatever, just to survive.</sentence><sentence
