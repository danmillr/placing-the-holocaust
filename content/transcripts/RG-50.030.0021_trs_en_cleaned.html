at the end of September, beginning of October, finally the aktion took place in It was preceded by a request from the Gestapo to Max Glickstern, the Judenrateltester, to furnish two hundred fifty Jews.</sentence><sentence id="611">The rumors said that the two hundred fifty Jews were meant to go for schmeltz (ph) what that means ?.</sentence><sentence id="612">That means for

after the aktion, I had decided to form for myself a boivka (ph), a fighting group, and I recruited for it a woman and her husband by the name of Padover.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Why did I...it was an energetic woman in her late thirties or beginning forties who was, who grew up in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1039">She knew every <span class="NPIP">area

class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> at our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, it turned out to be a complete fiasco.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Mr. Padover had decided meantime...he showed up at our <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> with an eighteen year old kid.</sentence><sentence id="1047">I said where is your wife, because the reason why I had recruited him was his wife, not he.</sentence><sentence id="1048">And he said ah she's too old for me.</sentence><sentence id="1049">The young man who had said he's going to bring a brother brought a fourteen year old kid...thin...I don't know if he was uh maybe ninety-five pounds...thin...you know, every uh wind uh draft would would...my whole fighting group turned out to be really nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1050">Anyway we found...we had made an appointment with the Ukrainian fellow who took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh where he fed us really and uh hid us and two weeks or ten days later, there was an

id="1054">We lost each other and Gusti and I ended up together out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Meantime it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1056">We didn't have where to go.</sentence><sentence id="1057">I'm reminded now the promise which Mr. Zarevski, the husband that Pole had told me...it took me one and a haLf days to get.</sentence><sentence id="1058">He was in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smikow</span> (ph), I don't remember exactly.</sentence><sentence id="1059">He lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> outside...I knew where he lived because he had brought me to see his wife there and uh was hard to get there.</sentence><sentence id="1060">It was <span class="NPIP">outside</span>...he he tried to keep a very low profile, being Polish and I...then later I understood why.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Because it turned out he was a member of the underground, the Polish underground.</sentence><sentence id="1062">When I knocked on his <span class="DLF">window</span> it must have been four o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh I heard somebody moving <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Finally he opened and then I told through the <span class="DLF">window</span> who it is.</sentence><sentence id="1065">I uh...he opened and let us in.</sentence><sentence id="1066">We were exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="1067">He gave us some food.</sentence><sentence id="1068">He let us sleep there and then he said, look, uh uh this is a bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I didn't understand why.</sentence><sentence id="1070">To me it looked like a very good <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1071">But he said this is... have to find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for you.</sentence><sentence id="1072">A week later or six days later, he said I found somebody.</sentence><sentence id="1073">He took us on a tour which lasted probably three hours, way into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and he, on the way there, he said the furster (ph)...furster is a a uh uh Polanization or Ukrainization of the German word .</sentence><sentence id="1074">It means a man who takes care of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, of uh uh...he's a representative of the of the <span class="REGION">county</span>, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1075">He

id="1078">We met him there and he again said...we came there.</sentence><sentence id="1079">The first thing we ate something after these three and a half hours of walk and uh he was very respectful toward Mr. Zaresvki, as if he would be his superior.</sentence><sentence id="1080">I didn't understand why.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Whatever he...and that he knew about us already and he said yes, I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you, but not here where he lived...he he was with his wife there.</sentence><sentence id="1082">He was a rep...he spoke Polish with Mr.

id="1084">He was an employee of the State, not of the county, and...but he was very respectful toward Mr. Zarevski, and they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> some four kilometers far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, an empty <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - hay with an at...so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>, you know, and uh we...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> there was something which looked like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> as if somebody had slept.</sentence><sentence id="1085">I understood why he brought us there.</sentence><sentence id="1086">That means if somebody would find out that Jews are there, he could say he didn't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1087">He said he will visit us every week.</sentence><sentence id="1088">He gave us a couple of uh blankets and he gave us some food.</sentence><sentence id="1091">4 he said he's going once a week to visit us, night time, and really uh it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1092">For three weeks he came every week, brought us food.</sentence><sentence id="1093">One day I saw around six o'clock...it was already slightly

a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Now...he told me now about his plan.</sentence><sentence id="1130">He said I'm going to be a courier for them (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1131">He said the contacts of the army of takes place only through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and it is very hard because they have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> to smuggle, to...by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and from there to...and from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> they have no problem getting to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> but because the Polish government in exile is direct organization from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the contacts through through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> is bad.</sentence><sentence id="1132">He still is waiting but his immediate superior in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamberg</span> (ph), in

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">receptacle</span>, you know, so I was trying to drink directly.</sentence><sentence id="1168">You know, when you are hungry you do many things.</sentence><sentence id="1169">But this was the built-in uh milk supply of that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1170">The couple were under apparently Pole-friendly, Polish uh friendly to

one and a half days working eight to ten hours and there was nothing else to do.</sentence><sentence id="1187">You know, we could go out only in the...and so it happens that in the spring or April or May, walking around by myself to <span class="DLF">air</span>, to get a little fresh air and to get rid of that smell, that I happened and probably having strayed a little too far because I had

impression while I walked...this must have been in April...it was already, or May uh that uh...oh yes...meantime because of that knitting business, the attitude of our hosts had had started to improve.</sentence><sentence id="1191">It was only bad when they got drunk or had a fight, and usually then they uh then they had uh...they drank and they got a little high.</sentence><sentence id="1192">They started to have a fight.</sentence><sentence id="1193">It had to do with Polish-Ukrainian or I don't know because I didn't hear but there were times when he hit her and then she was

back, walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I had the impression somebody is following me, and I went in circles, walking a little farther than usually, and I heard uh...really I was sure now
