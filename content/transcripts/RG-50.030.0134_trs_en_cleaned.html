<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: At the end of December of 1937 we were only two Jewish boys left in my class and very few other Jews in the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I decided it made no sense to stay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</sentence><sentence id="108">I -- I knew I would never go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">It became more and more difficult, so I told my parents, "Enough is enough.</sentence><sentence id="110">I want out."</sentence><sentence id="111">And I started -- then we compromised and in the " Liberal arts high school (German) &gt; The sixth grade level in <span class="BUILDING">German Gymnasiums</span> (German) 3 High school graduation examination (German) "Hermann Goring beginning of 19-- immediately at the first few days of 1938, I went into a private, <span class="BUILDING">commercial language school</span> where I had French and I had English.</sentence><sentence id="112">I learned German, steno", just to keep me busy.</sentence><sentence id="113">After all, in 1930 -- at the beginning of "38, I was just 17 years old -- not -- no -- 16 years old.</sentence><sentence id="114">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there until the famous Crystal Night(r) of 1938 which was the end of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and basically for all German-Jewish children.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: We were not observant Jews in the -- in the sense that there was a <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span> or any such thing.</sentence><sentence id="138">My father belonged to a Gesangsverien", which is a singing organization which is very customary in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">This one happened to be the Jewish one.</sentence><sentence id="140">And my father was a member of that Board of Directors since almost immediately after World War I.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="141">Incidentally, my father was a soldier in World War I and was a veteran of front service, which permitted me actually to stay -- to stay in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> as long as did, because I believe in 1936 or 1935 already, the children of non-veterans were legislated out of <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="142">So, no we -- I mean we never -- my father also was a member of the legislative body of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> so there was never a question of where we belonged or where we were, but we did not per se be practicing Jews that we went regularly to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">I mean I was Bar Mitzvah, of course, my father would make an appearance as a member of the legislative counsel at least once a year in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on, on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="144">I went a few -- I went a number of times on Saturday morning more for social reasons than any other reasons -- we would meet with our friends.</sentence><sentence id="145">And, of course, we had every Friday night, there were -- a different meal with the German version of challah which is called Berches*.</sentence><sentence id="146">And so we were, of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="147">We were Jews, but there was no practice -- practicing Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="148">We would not light a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> candles for Hanukkah or would have a Seder, not withstanding the fact that for -- for these days, I always went to my uncle and my aunt, my -- the sister of my mother had no children of her own and until they immigrated in 1930 -- early in "34 to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, I was there on all these holidays like Pesach, etceteras, etceteras.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="149">5 stenography</sentence></p><p><sentence id="150">deg Kristallnacht</sentence></p><p><sentence id="151">7 glee club (German)</sentence></p><p><sentence id="152">* German-Jewish braided holiday bread.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="154">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="155">Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="156">By November, then, of 1938, you were a young 17 year old.</sentence><sentence id="157">You were going into this special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> waiting for something.</sentence><sentence id="158">What happened as we -- I am sorry -- as we approach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="160">No, that is okay.</sentence><sentence id="161">Since my father was very active in -- in this what originally started out for 80 or 90 years as a singing organization, was converted in 1933 or 1934, into what was referred to as a Jewish cultural organization.</sentence><sentence id="162">And since we were excluded from everything which had to do with culture, we had our own.</sentence><sentence id="163">In addition to the cause which was a mixed choir, there was an orchestra added, and by the time I was 14 or 15, I was in the orchestra and we did all kinds of opera, opera performances, oratorios.</sentence><sentence id="164">And all this, of course, stopped with the event in of -- at Crystal Night.</sentence><sentence id="165">Incidentally my father at the time of Crystal Night was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">His -- one of his <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> where he was always the number one salesman, suggested to him since they couldn't employ him anymore in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, if he wouldn't want to try to build an existence in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">We'll come back to this a little later.</sentence><sentence id="168">Let's do it chron--chronologically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: Just a point of confusion.</sentence><sentence id="180">You used the word "converted" to a Jewish cultural organization.</sentence><sentence id="181">I wonder if that's what you meant or if you where thinking of the Jewish ethical society.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="186">No.</sentence><sentence id="187">No.</sentence><sentence id="188">I didn't mean the conversion as a -- in a religious sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: I meant it, it used to be a it used to be simply an organization where an orchestra was -- the local orchestra was hired and they would sing concerts.</sentence><sentence id="196">Now we added on a an orchestra and it became a self-sustaining, Jewish cultural organization, where culture was continued parallel to whatever we were able to do with restrictions obviously.</sentence><sentence id="197">We were not permitted to do German composers.</sentence><sentence id="198">We had to restrict ourselves to either foreign composers or Jewish composers so we could not perform after 1934, I think, or "35 -- Bach was out.</sentence><sentence id="199">But we did do Orpheus and Eurydice, by Gluck".</sentence><sentence id="200">We were permitted to do an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span>"?</sentence><sentence id="201">opera -- operetta.</sentence><sentence id="202">We did Judas, Judas Maccabaeus, by Handel"!</sentence><sentence id="203">and things like this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: What happened as we moved toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Crystal Night, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">This is a <span class="BUILDING">commercial school</span> where I went like on every day, and it seems to be I walked on that day.</sentence><sentence id="217">Why I walked and didn't use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, I cannot remember.</sentence><sentence id="218">But I walked.</sentence><sentence id="219">And I did not really see much of mobs because I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at eight o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="220">I saw something which struck me funny.</sentence><sentence id="221">I didn't give it a second thought.</sentence><sentence id="222">I deg Christoph Willibald Gluck wy acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach u George Frideric Handel went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and around nine or nine-thirty, the telephone I was called by the directress and was told, "Your mother has called.</sentence><sentence id="223">You should leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> immediately, and you should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and you should wait in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> for your cousin who will come separately and you will spend the day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">When I called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to find out what was going on, I was told, "Don't ask so many stupid questions.</sentence><sentence id="225">Just go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and call me tonight."</sentence><sentence id="226">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> being only 10 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span>, I walked myself over from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to the. .</sentence><sentence id="227"><span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> which was only a 10 minute walk.</sentence><sentence id="228">And on the way I started to realize what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> being thrown out of <span class="DLF">windows</span> and people being arrested, but since I didn't look Jewish in their sense, nobody bothered me.</sentence><sentence id="230">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, bought a ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, and 15 minutes later was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> where I met my cousin and we spent the day in the famous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Heidelberg woods</span>, walking and there seems to be a -- a faint memory that we were supposed to touch base with a -- I don't know if it was a far relative of my grandmother or just friends.</sentence><sentence id="231">In any case they were of Czech nationality and we were supposed to touch base there to see what was going on and I arranged -- we agreed with my cousin that this would take place around -- after four o'clock in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="232">So we walked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and my cousin got very nervous and wanted to come down much earlier.</sentence><sentence id="233">However, I said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="234">We, we said -- we agreed it was four o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="235">We are not going to change the date."</sentence><sentence id="236">Which was very fortunate because by the time I -- we got there or shortly after four o'clock, the man had been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="237">If we would have gotten there earlier, we would have probably been arrested to.</sentence><sentence id="238">So we continued walking around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and when I called my mother at seven o'clock, she said she thinks the worst is over.</sentence><sentence id="239">We should come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">Now let me add there that in the beginning of 1938, since nobody knew how long we would have to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, my father was gone and there was no income coming we had given up our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and had moved in with my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="241">My grandmother happened to be a French citizen which is a story in itself which came about shortly after the war.</sentence><sentence id="242">She wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span>'s twin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigshafen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: You mean after World War I?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: After World War I. And when she came -- she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and when she came to the rail to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugwigshafen</span>, the French had blocked passage for the day.</sentence><sentence id="277">They did this on occasion.</sentence><sentence id="278">And so my Grandmother descended from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and was trying to force her way across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">She called the watch commander and explained to him that she is born before the Franco-Prussian War in 1970"?</sentence><sentence id="280">in the <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="281">" The interviewee later corrects this date to 1870.</sentence><sentence id="282">therefore, by rights, she is French.</sentence><sentence id="283">And the man happened to be a lawyer and explained to her that in order to become a French citizen again, she would simply have to apply for what was called reinstatement of some kind -- I forgot the French word right now -- which she did .</sentence><sentence id="284">Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or "21 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I, there were no political discussion in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because my grandmother, not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot.</sentence><sentence id="285">So my Grandmother then applied for reinstatement and became a French citizen.</sentence><sentence id="286">So in 1938, on Crystal Night day, which was November 10th, when the destruction took place, my mother called the <span class="BUILDING">French consulate</span> when the sa" started to smash in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back loft</span> where my grandmother had <span class="INT_SPACE">commercial space</span> rented out to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span> who sold glass -- glass fixtures, electrical glass fixtures.</sentence><sentence id="287">And this was smashed to millions of bits and when my mother called -- my mother called the <span class="BUILDING">French Consulate</span> because after all the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in the name of my grandmother -- was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- in order to protect the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from destruction.</sentence><sentence id="288">And within five or 10 minutes an SA man in uniform came, stopped the carnage in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back loft</span> and was posted there all day long in order to protect my grandfather's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> who was after all a French citizen.</sentence><sentence id="289">So I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in, in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="290">Without a doubt the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was destroyed, but I do remember that one or two days after the 10th of November, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ludwigshafen</span> to help a former member of the orchestra straighten out her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was in, in pitiful shape.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="291">After Crystal Night 1938, I spent 1939 basically doing nothing.</sentence><sentence id="292">There was nothing I could do.</sentence><sentence id="293">I was reading a book a day and then war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="294">Now I think we should come back to my father.</sentence><sentence id="295">In March of 1938, my father went to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and after a few months was able to start selling his company's goods again which did not sit too well with the German competition.</sentence><sentence id="296">And when they figured out in 1939 who was behind their loss of business which went to another <span class="BUILDING">firm</span>, they managed to get my father expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">My father went, I think in May, from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">In fact, my mother visited him in August of 1939 in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">She had a passport.</sentence><sentence id="300">We all had passports.</sentence><sentence id="301">And at that time was so convinced that nobody would be insane enough to start another war -- this was in August of 1939 -- that she came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and instead of calling me who also had a passport to join her in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, so the family would have been reunited.</sentence><sentence id="302">So my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> second my father illegally went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ventimiglia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>, across <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> -- on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> around the <span class="DLF">border</span> and, of course, did all the things other people did who came in illegally.</sentence><sentence id="303">He was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a few weeks, and then he lived precariously in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> until he was accidentally until he ran into a German patrol accidentally in, in 1944, and was deported.</sentence><sentence id="304">My mother came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and on first of September 1939, World War Two broke out.</sentence><sentence id="305">The first thing which happened was that we were called to a <span class="BUILDING">Wehrmacht" office</span> where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="306">In other words, we could not serve.</sentence><sentence id="307">We were not -- it was, it was not dignified for Jews to serve in the German, army.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="308">8 Sturmabteilung [storm troopers] (German)</sentence></p><p><sentence id="309">"4 Armed forces (German)</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Had he been admitted to the German army.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="312">We had not been admitted to the German army, but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course, we, we were not mobilized.</sentence><sentence id="313">Then in -- that was in the middle of September.</sentence><sentence id="314">Shortly after that, I was required to perform how would you call this, harvesting service in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">That was east of Frank--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">It was very far away in those days, it was a trip overnight through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oder</span>, and I was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">We were quartered in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where you normally would have <span class="BUILDING">weddings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">There were they installed <span class="DLF">platforms</span> where we could sleep on.</sentence><sentence

which the Spanish refugees had made for us for money with barbed wire where the barbs were taken out and the wire was used as, as a mattress support.</sentence><sentence id="633">So there I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">We could light a fire in the evening during the day and I shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a man who was really responsible for -- he was really the, the block chief for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to the extent that this was necessary.</sentence><sentence id="635">This was basically the

id="647">The one problem we had with the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was neither he nor I were Orthodox and this was not an <span class="DLF">Orthodox farm</span>, but an ultra<span class="DLF">-Orthodox farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="648">They didn't let us work too much because they knew we were so skinny, we couldn't have worked anyway.</sentence><sentence id="649">And around the end of July, the very end of July, my girlfriend came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> having obtained permission to visit her mother and I saw her then for the first time after about a year.</sentence><sentence id="650">And when she came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, she came again to tell me that her mother was deported.</sentence><sentence id="651">She could not enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="652">She will tell you that herself.</sentence><sentence id="653">And we arranged then and there that if there would be problems for me that I should try to make my way to where she was because she felt certain that there would be help for anybody who is up there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="654">Now, you must remember this was -- she was, of course, in 1942, she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on, it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help.</sentence><sentence id="655">What we didn't know was that about a week or two after she had left we -- an announcement was made by the management of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> that they were notified that in about two weeks or two and a half weeks, there would be raids on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and all the foreign Jews would be arrested, which meant all of us, of course.</sentence><sentence id="656">But not to worry, that we would be helped by hiding.</sentence><sentence id="657">But when the time came to disperse everybody, help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="658">What was interesting is that these people who were running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> who are mentioned by name in, in -- as being very helpful while they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> -- in a book by Schramm" about her experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> and but there was no help for us.</sentence><sentence id="659">We were told, "Do what you feel is right.</sentence><sentence id="660">Go wherever you want to go."</sentence><sentence id="661">And that was the end for that.</sentence><sentence id="662">So my friend and I from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span>, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, which wasn't so far away from there, because all we knew Hanne had explained to us, we leave to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Etienne</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Etienne</span> I believe there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going up to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="780">Q: These are the two rabbis who had refused to help you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="782">A: These are the two rabbis who did, did nothing to help.</sentence><sentence id="783">And their reaction was actually very interesting because if they could have sunk into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> to disappear when they saw us and we started to talk with them for a minute or two, they would have really disappeared because they visibly had a bad conscience when they saw us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="786">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="787">Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="788">Alright.</sentence><sentence id="789">So you left the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="794">A: So, we left the <span class="DLF">farm</span> early in the morning and by 10 o'clock at night, we were in the Le Chambon.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="804">Q: What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="806">A: Well, it was 10 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="807">Where I am going to find Hanne at 10 o'clock at night?</sentence><sentence id="808">I don't even know where she is.</sentence><sentence id="809">So, we decided we're going to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="810">There was a little <span class="DLF">wooded opening</span> in the middle of nowhere, and we decided that we are going to put our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bags</span> down and we're going to sleep there.</sentence><sentence id="811">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="812">Around four-thirty, five o'clock, five-fifteen in the morning, we hear -- we had just woken up and we had just folded up our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bags</span> when we hear girls" voices passing on the <span class="DLF">path</span> where we were in the in the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and who walked by?</sentence><sentence id="813">Hanne!</sentence><sentence id="814">With a few of the teenage girls who were with her in the little 6 children's home in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="815">And so I whistled after her because I had to run first to, to catch her and she absolutely refused to turn around.</sentence><sentence id="816">Her girlfriend, who knew me, saw me and tried to stop Hanne walking on and so eventually she physically turned her around.</sentence><sentence id="817">There was I was.</sentence><sentence id="818">So Hanne took us to Madame Andre Philip" , who she apparently -- she knew her, and she figured she would be a logical person to, to help.</sentence><sentence id="819">So Mireille asked her only one</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="820">Q: Can she trust me?</sentence><sentence id="821">Hanne said, "Yes.</sentence><sentence id="822">He's my boyfriend."</sentence><sentence id="823">And so Madame Phillip took me to a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> where I stayed overnight and in the meantime, obviously, she had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to stay.</sentence><sentence id="824">And so the next night I walked about an hour and a half at night to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> like the <span class="DLF">farms</span> which are -- were shown on the movie by Pierre Sauvage, typical <span class="DLF">farm</span> like this to a farmer whose name I don't know to this day.</sentence><sentence id="825">If I knew it, I forgot it but I don't know the name.</sentence><sentence id="826">Was aman, maybe in his late 40s.</sentence><sentence id="827">He looked old to me because he had a gray beard already, and his wife, and a teenage daughter and since <span class="DLF">farms</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">living spaces</span> very restricted because most is given over to animals and to hay he put me into the <span class="DLF">hayloft</span>, and I must say the man was very practical.</sentence><sentence id="828">The first thing he did, he cut a <span class="DLF">hole</span> at the end of the <span class="DLF">hayloft</span> into the where you would normally put a, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="829">He put a <span class="DLF">hole</span> there which led right down to the -- where the animals were so that I have -- would have my, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="830">It was the first thing he did, took a saw and cut out the <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="831">And I spent three and a half weeks in the <span class="BUILDING">hayloft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">I got my breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="833">I got my lunch, which I ate in the hayloft.</sentence><sentence id="834">They brought it.</sentence><sentence id="835">And I came down for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="836">I ate dinner with them in their <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">You know every night was a wonderful dinner for the times -- was potato soup with lard and milk poured into the soup and some vegetable.</sentence><sentence id="838">And what really these three and a half weeks with this farmer permitted me eventually to gain enough physical strength to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> which wasn't so easy, was a physical, great physical exercise.</sentence><sentence id="839">In fact, the only literature I had in, in this <span class="DLF">hayloft</span> for three and half was a New Testament.</sentence><sentence id="840">That's all he had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so he gave it to me and I read it.</sentence><sentence id="841">And I thought already, "They must have forgotten I am here."</sentence><sentence id="842">I didn't hear from anybody.</sentence><sentence id="843">I didn't see anybody.</sentence><sentence id="844">I was totally alone with these farm people for three and a half weeks.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="870">Q: You didn't see Hanne?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="871">Q: No, Hanne was -- in fact, Hanne during this period was hiding herself most of the time with another farmer because there were raids going on all over the so-called unoccupied zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the people were being arrested and deported.</sentence><sentence id="872">So one day the farmer brought me a little note from Hanne so at least I knew, aside from hearing from Hanne, I knew that people knew where I was.</sentence><sentence id="873">And lo and behold a few days later at right somebody came to pick me up to bring me back to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">I slept in the same <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> where I was -- when I was</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="879">*!</sentence><sentence id="880">Mireille Philip 7 brought.</sentence><sentence id="881">The next day Madame Philip, and I saw Hanne, of course, who had come back at the same time too apparently, and Madame Philip explained to me that they are going to make photograph of me, giving me false papers and will help me to get across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to the French Alps and from there I would be helped into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="882">So they had -- the papers were made.</sentence><sentence id="883">I got them at night.</sentence><sentence id="884">And the next morning I set off with three other young fellows from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">In a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, we went across that portion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into the <span class="REGION">French Alps</span> and we stopped -- I don't remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="886">One - - I believe it was one stop before Saint Gervais -- in the <span class="REGION">French Alps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="887">There a 10 year old boy picked us up, brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of his father.</sentence><sentence id="888">We met there a, a young Protestant minister who was supposed to go with us when we would cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to learn the <span class="DLF">route</span> so that he would help people later on go the same route.</sentence><sentence id="889">So the next morning we set off.</sentence><sentence id="890">Our guide was this 10 year old boy who knew these, these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> like his back pocket.</sentence><sentence id="891">The priest and the four of us, the minister and the four of us and we climbed all day until it was night.</sentence><sentence id="892">We stayed -- it was raining at night -- we stayed under an <span class="DLF">overhang</span> under a rock so we were dry and we -- I was even able to sleep even.</sentence><sentence id="893">And we continued the next day and sometimes maybe at eight o'clock, we started very early, and sometimes during the morning the boy said, "Now, from here on, you are on your own."</sentence><sentence id="894">He explained to us where we had to go.</sentence><sentence id="895">He told us we would have to go down this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="896">We were about -- I don't now -- .somewhere around the 9,000 foot level probably, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, well above the <span class="DLF">tree line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">He explained to us where we should go and said we would come into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="898">They also told us -- the minister told us, we should get rid of our false identification cards because they were afraid that if the Swiss find false papers on us, they might suspect an organized effort behind this and would immediately return us.</sentence><sentence id="899">Well we, we climbed most of the day down, eventually ended up on a <span class="DLF">highway</span> which was totally deserted, and walked on this <span class="DLF">highway</span> further down, descended through a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> we were stopped by a patrol who had -- as they told us when they brought us back to the -- to a <span class="BUILDING">mountain hut</span> where we found another 30 or 40 people which were gone during the day.</sentence><sentence id="900">They told us that they had watched for hours with their glasses coming down.</sentence><sentence id="901">The next morning we were, we were able to buy -- I had one or two Francs.</sentence><sentence id="902">It was enough to buy some breakfast in this <span class="BUILDING">mountain hut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="903">All of us were told that we would be returned to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="904">We would not be kept.</sentence><sentence id="905">A detachment of soldiers started to bring us back up into what is -- what they called no man's land, from where we would descend again to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="906">Now we came into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, in the valley not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="907">I was able to determine this later where I was.</sentence><sentence id="908">And I managed also in the morning during breakfast to look at the map and I had somebody show me from the Swiss where we were.</sentence><sentence id="909">So I knew exactly where I was.</sentence><sentence id="910">So a detachment of soldier--soldiers took us back up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, well above the <span class="DLF">tree line</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="911">And then something very extraordinary happened during this hike up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">All of a sudden, a non-commissioned Swiss soldier started 8 to scream at me and tiraded me for about 15 minutes, screamed at me what I'm not permitted to do: I'm not permitted to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, I'm not permitted to do this, I am not permitted to do that.</sentence><sentence id="913">What the man really did in these 15 minutes, he laid out for me but exactly how to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="914">All I had to do is subtract the word "not."</sentence><sentence id="915">The tragedy was that everybody in our group heard this.</sentence><sentence id="916">Nobody understood what this man was trying to do.</sentence><sentence id="917">So eventually the captain of -- of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detachment</span> stopped and told us that they would stay here and we should go on.</sentence><sentence id="918">So the first thing I did was -- we went on.</sentence><sentence id="919">We went across a <span class="DLF">bend</span>, around the bend, where I was sure the Swiss couldn't see us anymore.</sentence><sentence id="920">Then I stopped the whole group and I explained to them what just had transpired, and they had all heard it.</sentence><sentence id="921">And we argued this out for an hour and nobody understood -- had understood what this was all about and these people were so shaken that after an hour of talking with them, I finally found one person who was willing to see the -- my logic and my reasoning that we know what's down there and all we do is possibly waste another day, but we also may -- might save our lives.</sentence><sentence id="922">So this one fellow and I separated from the group, and the rest went down and I went back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="923">We crossed a little icy stream coming down, which was a <span class="DLF">glacier border</span>, you know, but not further than a few like this.</sentence><sentence id="924">Was very narrow because it had only started a little further up, and we climbed further up and all of a sudden we were on a very, very narrow <span class="DLF">path</span> and the fellow who was with me who didn't know really where he was -- an Austrian, I never saw him again after, after we separated in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- wanted to go to the right and I wanted to go down to the left.</sentence><sentence id="925">And I said, "When -- look when you go to the right, you're going nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="926">You're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> possibly."</sentence><sentence id="927">But in order to convince him, I said, "Alright.</sentence><sentence id="928">Let's walk to the right the way you want to walk because I am sure you will, will end up nowhere."</sentence><sentence id="929">And lo and behold, after five minutes, we were abruptly at the <span class="DLF">precipice</span> down 1,000 or 3,000 feet, was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="930">So, he finally believed me and we turned around and we walked the same <span class="DLF">path</span>.</sentence><sentence id="931">We came back and eventually this very narrow little <span class="DLF">path</span> became wider and became wider, became a little <span class="DLF">road</span> and we eventually came into a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">Now I had no Swiss money.</sentence><sentence id="933">He still had some.</sentence><sentence id="934">And we had been told in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> already that if we need help we should look for a Protestant minister.</sentence><sentence id="935">If there's no Protestant minister, go to the Catholic priest.</sentence><sentence id="936">They probably will help you.</sentence><sentence id="937">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="938">There was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="939">Yeah, but the priest wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="940">He was -- had gone into the valley for the day.</sentence><sentence id="941">So we went on and it became dusk.</sentence><sentence id="942">I didn't want to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Finhaut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="943">It was too big for me.</sentence><sentence id="944">So it became eventually dark and we walked and we came through another few -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of maybe 10 or 15 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and I looked around and I said, "I don't want to sleep in the open again tonight."</sentence><sentence id="945">I had slept two nights before in the open -- in the rain.</sentence><sentence id="946">So I picked a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which I thought looked friendly and just knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a man peers out.</sentence><sentence id="947">I explained to him, "We are <span class="BUILDING">refuges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="948">Could we stay over for the night?"</sentence><sentence id="949">And he said, Well, he's newly-wed.</sentence><sentence id="950">It's not his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">It's a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of his brother-in-law, but why don't we wait.</sentence><sentence id="952">"T'll, I'll ask him."</sentence><sentence id="953">Well, after five minutes, he came back, "Come on in."</sentence><sentence id="954">They gave us food.</sentence><sentence id="955">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="956">They gave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where we were and where we should go, so we walked most of the day and, and he also told 9 us not to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martigny</span> -- which was the next larger <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martigny</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">garrison city</span> with military police all over.</sentence><sentence id="957">So -- and military all over.</sentence><sentence id="958">We would probably get, get stopped.</sentence><sentence id="959">So we went to -- he showed us a way how to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="960">I don't remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="961">And by then it was already two or three o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="962">Here we had walked all day to come down and then I went again to the Catholic priest's house.</sentence><sentence id="963">He gave us two eggs to eat, which was something because there was strict rationing in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he gave me five francs which was enough to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span>, the next bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, where I wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="964">And he also told me, "Don't go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="965">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express train</span> is checked by military police.</sentence><sentence id="966">Go with the local <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="967">And lo and behold, we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">Nobody had bothered us.</sentence><sentence id="969">Then I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and I really, for a moment, didn't know what to do with myself until about 15 or 20 -- we were wondering aimlessly around this -- this <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> until I realized, "You are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="970">God, why don't you look in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> for the Jewish community?"</sentence><sentence id="971">I went to the telephone book.</sentence><sentence id="972">The other guy wasn't much help.</sentence><sentence id="973">He followed.</sentence><sentence id="974">And lo and behold, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Community</span> was Rue de la Gare -- it's the <span class="DLF">railroad street</span>, the <span class="DLF">station street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="975">So we went out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and within one or two minutes, we were -- we walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, who welcomed us and told us, "Now look, we have to turn you over to the Swiss authorities, but don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="976">You will not be returned."</sentence><sentence id="977">These people had not known, of course.</sentence><sentence id="978">I had never told anybody that I had been arrested and, and the Swiss who were up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> did not take apparently our names down, did not report it, so nobody knew apparently, as it turned out, that I had been 48 hours or 24 hours before already in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and was returned.</sentence><sentence id="979">So we were turned over to the military.</sentence><sentence id="980">We were kept for a few days in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ouchy</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lausanne</span>, where we had to fill out long questionnaires and were interrogated by some investigators who fortunately did not speak German and my Austrian friend with whom I had come did not speak French or very little French, so I was translating the way it suited me from what he said, to what I told the guy, so he never knew anything what I didn't want him to know.</sentence><sentence id="981">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ouchy</span>, we were taken to a quarantine, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="982">You can't call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="983">It was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> of a local <span class="BUILDING">inn</span>, where they had made matt-- you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platforms</span> to sleep on.</sentence><sentence id="984">And they fed us, and the food was good.</sentence><sentence id="985">There was nothing wrong.</sentence><sentence id="986">It wasn't, wasn't French food.</sentence><sentence id="987">It was at least -- and we were there from September after -- oh yeah, end of September, October first maybe until about four weeks and then four weeks later, we were transferred to another identical facility on the other end of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and there I was for another four weeks probably.</sentence><sentence id="988">And on December 22nd, 1942 I was given papers to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> again in the French part of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="989">And when I came there in the early afternoon, the only person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was the camp director.</sentence><sentence id="990">It was then a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span> -- was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> with <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">The 0 only person there was a director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who had -- with his wife and his small child at the time, who not that small -- the daughter was maybe 12 or 13.</sentence><sentence id="992">Everybody else was on leave somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="993">So the first question was, "What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="994">I said, "I was assigned here" "You have any family somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="995">I said, "Yes.</sentence><sentence id="996">I have a cousin here." "</sentence><sentence id="997">Let's call him.</sentence><sentence id="998">Maybe you can go there."</sentence><sentence id="999">So I came from, from almost the <span class="DLF">border</span> of, of the Swiss<span class="DLF">-German border</span> and I went practically back to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> because my cousin lived very close by.</sentence><sentence id="1000">And I spent three days or four days with my cousin during the Christmas holidays and then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I started camp life in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1207">A: Well, Hanne came in February of -- February 28, 1943.</sentence><sentence id="1208">She will tell you she came a different way.</sentence><sentence id="1209">The difference between her and me was that I came and remained an illegal alien in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for the entire five and a half years we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> while the moment Hanne set foot on <span class="REGION">Swiss soil</span>, she was legal because her relatives had procured a Swiss visa.</sentence><sentence id="1210">We managed to get permission after I was married.</sentence><sentence id="1211">After all, I knew the ropes, how to do these things.</sentence><sentence id="1212">I was in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> all this time.</sentence><sentence id="1213">I got permission to bring her .with me, to live with me.</sentence><sentence id="1214">Then eventually they decided since she is really not an internee, and a -- but a legal foreigner, she could not live with me.</sentence><sentence id="1215">Then we had to go through the charade of having a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreux</span> would cost a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="1216">We had to pay for the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, which she didn't use once.</sentence><sentence id="1217">She stayed with me in, in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I was.</sentence><sentence id="1218">Eventually, we were able to give up the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And after the social services course we came -- I went back to a <span class="BUILDING">refuge home</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1220">I was assigned again to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, to run an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she came along.</sentence><sentence id="1221">By the way, while I was, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and Hanne was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> -- and the circumstances of Hanne staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> she will tell you herself -- we, all of a sudden, we are approached by -- now I can't think of the name of the man -- by a German Gentile.</sentence><sentence id="1222">I believe he was Gentile.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And we were not married at the time yet.</sentence><sentence id="1224">Hanne will probably supply the name.</sentence><sentence id="1225">I can't think of it right now.</sentence><sentence id="1226">He invited us for tea twice, and he was really trying to recruit us.</sentence><sentence id="1227">The war would end soon.</sentence><sentence id="1228">It was in 1944 or early 1945, and why wouldn't we come to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> where the Russians were to help build up <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1229">And we got into a rather lengthy discussion twice about the merits of going into an authoritarian dictatorship.</sentence><sentence id="1230">I pointed out to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> which the man tried not to play down, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1231">And eventually, I made -- we made it clear to him that we are not interested.</sentence><sentence id="1232">What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later, we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandt"", who was German Prime Minister, and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war, he came back to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>, eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities, was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, somehow when he was released managed to get to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt.</sentence><sentence id="1233">So, 22 Willy Brandt (nee Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm) 2 Hanne and I got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in -- on April 14, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1234">Our daughter was born in March of 1946, and in 1948 in -- after we had obtained our visas for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, we came here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1265">Q: Where did you go once you came here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1267">A: We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1268">In the beginning, you know, I was told, "Go to HIAS(tm), Maybe they can help you."</sentence><sentence id="1269">And we went, and the suggestion was made, "Why don't you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pritoria</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peoria</span> ?"</sentence><sentence id="1270"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peoria</span>, <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Well, first, of course, no <span class="NPIP">where</span> -- I didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="1272">For the first two weeks so I permitted myself the question, "Who's going to pay for all of this?"

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="1345">Continue.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: It shows that there were always periods given in which we are permitted to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1349">It was always a year or so and then it had to be renewed, which was a formality because they know, they know we couldn't go anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1350">It shows here, for instance, that we were interned by order of the police -- the federal police really.</sentence><sentence id="1351">This is the record of all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where I was in from.</sentence><sentence id="1352">And it finally has pages which shows what rationing cards were issued to me.</sentence><sentence id="1353">Because after all, the Swiss are worse bureaucrats than the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1354">Now finally, on this page are three numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1355">One is a number which -- under which I went while I was interned in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1356">Actually I was more in formal <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed.</sentence><sentence id="1357">One of those numbers is a police department number from the federal police.</sentence><sentence id="1358">My -- I had an aunt who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, who was married in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, who gave on the occasion of one of her visits a passport application where we had tried for me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> to study at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory of music</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And as we discovered, this was a number which was given to me by the Swiss when I became -- when I came into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1360">Not only this, but when Hanne married me, all of sudden she -- this same number turned up on her refugee pass.</sentence><sentence id="1361">We never were told anything about it, but you know the Swiss are very subtle.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And since we had to fill out when we came a questionnaire of maybe 30 pages, they were able to trace back who we were and they matched my passport application from 1939 to my arrival in 1942 in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Now, the other thing I wanted to show yet is the passport I used or we were issued in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> since we refused to accept German papers.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I did not want a German passport.</sentence><sentence id="1365">I wanted no part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1366">So this is the Swiss travel document which was used for us to obtain our American visa which is in here.</sentence><sentence id="1367">It's just like a regular passport.</sentence><sentence id="1368">It had our transit visa and our immigration visa.</sentence><sentence id="1369">This is the immigration visa into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> signed by the same man who had been promoted from Vice Consul to Consul who in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gave untold people untold trouble.</sentence><sentence id="1370">I don't know if this ever was mentioned in an interview, but to obtain a immigration visa in those days in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was an extremely harrowing experience.</sentence><sentence id="1371">Any pretext would be used to deny a visa.</sentence><sentence id="1372">People would come with their children.</sentence><sentence id="1373">The child might have bumped her arm or his leg and there would be a blue mark.</sentence><sentence id="1374">This was enough, during the physical examination which was given in the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.776443" long="9.179887">Stuttgart</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, to reject an application or to postpone an application for three, or four, or five months.</sentence></p></dialogue>
