the [indecipherable] all the exercise, and so on, but in -- in spare time, day time, lunch time, evening, you do the -- the office work.</sentence><sentence id="66">No -- experienced I was, so they very fast decided that I can do the ho -- the payroll for the <span class="BUILDING">company</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="67">Order was I get involved in many thing -- the -- the company payroll for the officers and all kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="68">And this way I get the contact with -- the battalion commander at this time, if I recall, was a majer -- Major Sheemak, in

class="BUILDING">casino</span>, and I start to drink, you come with me and take away my gun."</sentence><sentence id="74">Order is order, I did it.</sentence><sentence id="75">And when I came in, he didn't say anything, just took out the gun and gave it to me.</sentence><sentence id="76">This was -- this was not nice.</sentence><sentence id="77">And this way was on -- I was in the army until I went to the -- exercise the records there and so on, so on.</sentence><sentence id="78">This part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> belong to the division per -- General Halla was in charge of the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="79">And when it came to the examination after the -- the three months, and the commander of the infantry for the division came for the -- for the high ranking general -- came down, then naturally they -- they have the bas -- the exercises.</sentence><sentence id="80">So when they start to ask question atfil, whatever he asked me to do, and he right away picked on me.</sentence><sentence id="81">And whatever he</sentence><sentence id="83">asked me to do, I did.</sentence><sentence id="84">I considered myself a pretty good soldier, and I knew what I am doing.</sentence><sentence id="85">And finally at the afternoon exams in the class, asking question again, and the professional -- one the officers didn't know all the answers always, so he picked on me.</sentence><sentence id="86">One of the question was, who did more for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, General Halla, or Pilsudski?</sentence><sentence id="87">And behind him, there was standing officers, and he which showed me to mark on the picture where -- where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halla</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="88">I said, "No, in mine opinion Pilsudski did

there and swear it in.</sentence><sentence id="92">And then, in the meantime, waiting for the rabbi to come and so on, the officers made jokes.</sentence><sentence id="93">Naturally, anti-Semitic jokes were no problem there, so they -- they had fun.</sentence><sentence id="94">Finally there came the news that the rabbi arrived.</sentence><sentence id="95">So they had to send a -- a horse and
