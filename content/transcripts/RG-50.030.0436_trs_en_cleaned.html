<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: My most distinct memories are that I was much closer to my father than to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="21">He was a very well-educated man who was very interested in education and since I was an only child, he gave me a lot of attention in this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">He had returned from the first World War with a shrapnel in his hip which was not properly removed, so he was not well, he didn't walk easily and was very sedentary and his greatest joy was to teach me.</sentence><sentence id="23">Geography, history, languages.</sentence><sentence id="24">This is how he instilled in me a great love for education.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: Did you identify as a Jewish person or Jewish girl?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Not at all.</sentence><sentence id="41">It was, I don't know how to explain it, but it was just not very important.</sentence><sentence id="42">Although I do remember that my parents contributed to, to Zionism.</sentence><sentence id="43">We had in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a certain, I don't know how you call it, <span class="BUILDING">piggy bank</span>, where we always put money in and this was with, in the shape of, I don't know if it was apart, but it was white and blue.</sentence><sentence id="44">And we always put money in there and I</sentence><sentence id="46">have no idea where that money went but it was explained to me as a child that this is for, for Jewish people who needed it.</sentence><sentence id="47">That's all I know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: I guess I assume that your friendships were very mixed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Very mixed, our neighbors left and right were not Jews, but there were also quite a few Jews among them.</sentence><sentence id="60">It was, until 1937, I was not at all aware.</sentence><sentence id="61">I shouldn't say that because I do remember now that on Memorial Day, which is a holiday for everywhere in the world and schoolchildren went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> but the Jewish schoolchildren were separated from the others and went to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">That is when I became aware that, that there was a difference between the other children and me.</sentence><sentence id="63">That's all I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: But nothing that made you feel terribly different?</sentence><sentence id="70">Were you, were you ever aware of anti- Semitism, early in...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes, yes, at that time I became aware of anti-Semitism and particularly in 1937, there were times where in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, soldiers, Romanian soldiers and particularly Romanian officers, who probably often got drunk, were roaming the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with guns, with the revolvers in their hands and yelling loud words against Jews.</sentence><sentence id="74">Yes, I was, that was when I began to be very much afraid.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Did, did that attitude affect the, your Christian friends?</sentence><sentence id="78">I mean, did they pick up the spirit of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: No, not particularly, as a matter of fact, I remember one incident where this one Romanian officer was running through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and yelling, "I'm going to kill all the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="82">A couple of friends of my father's, my stepfather, this was in 1937,"38, a couple of friends who were not Jews, tried to approach this officer and to talk reason to him and they were, I had completely the feeling that they were on our side, that they were not against us and they were two of the leading people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">So I didn't have a complete feeling of being betrayed by every Christian, you know.</sentence><sentence id="84">But, I can't describe it too well, this is how it began.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: And then at what point did it get worse?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Well we heard then the speeches that Hitler gave on the radio and we kept thinking, well it's not going to last too long, because sane people would not accept this and all, and anyway it's not here,</sentence><sentence id="93">it's somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, but and then it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was pretty close to where we lived, but we still couldn't believe it, we still didn't think that it would find us.</sentence><sentence id="94">I can't, when I think of this now, I just can't understand how my parents did not accept my uncle's offer to leave.</sentence><sentence id="95">They, they simply didn't think that anything could happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="96">And we saw a number of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we made <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we lived for them to sleep and we saw how it happened, but we still didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="97">And then in 1940, when Hitler and Stalin made this pact, we had not very much of a choice.</sentence><sentence id="98">We thought, since we knew what happened under Hitler to people, that we would in fact be better off to stay where we are and very many people were glad that the Soviets came.</sentence><sentence id="99">Of course, we didn't know what would happen.</sentence><sentence id="100">It was hard.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about life under the Soviets?</sentence><sentence id="113">I know that you've told me before that your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was taken away from you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: What else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: The interesting part was that their propaganda was so efficient, they, there were concerts, the people danced in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">There were speeches that there is no better quality of life than in the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="122">The children got their education for free.</sentence><sentence id="123">The older people got their medical help for free.</sentence><sentence id="124">People were taken care of from their birth to their day they died.</sentence><sentence id="125">They never had to worry.</sentence><sentence id="126">And all of this wonderful thing happened because the Communist government knew how to take care of it's people.</sentence><sentence id="127">And in the meantime, during the night, people disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="128">And this, this was very, very difficult, because it hit us almost immediately and then one of the Soviets, who moved into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, told me, first of all he said to me, "You know that there is no God."</sentence><sentence id="129">And you know this, for me, even though I was not brought up in a strict religious sense, it was awful thing for me to hear.</sentence><sentence id="130">And then when my father was taken away, this man, whose name I do not know, I don't think I even knew it then, this man said to me, "Look, you are a young person, you have the best chance for a wonderful life in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, but you have to put an ad in the paper that you want to have nothing to do with your father, who is an enemy of the people."</sentence><sentence id="131">And of course I didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="134">This is how life was under the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="135">We saw a big poster, said, was seen in many <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">Stalin was holding on his lap a child and giving the child a wristwatch, because that child had informed the teacher that the parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had spoken against the government.</sentence><sentence id="137">And what the parents had said was, "No eggs today for breakfast."</sentence><sentence id="138">And the father had said, "Again no eggs?"</sentence><sentence id="139">And this was regarded as counter-revolutionary talk.</sentence><sentence id="140">The parents were arrested and the child got a watch.</sentence><sentence id="141">The parents disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="142">That was how life was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Did, were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> taken away, were people allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, did sort of every day life change?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: People went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> were taken away, all businesses were taken away but the difference was that the Christians who had businesses could, under the pack that Hitler and Stalin had, could say that they are false Germans, which means that their ancestors were of German background and therefore they were not arrested.</sentence><sentence id="170">They had the right to be resettled into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and while the Soviets took away their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sattagura(ph</span>) or in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, when they were resettled, they got an, an equivalent <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And I even know about one man who was taken the same night as my father, who was a Christian and who was a merchant, a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="172">He, he dealt with, he sold ham and, and kielbasa and had pigs and made them, made, made these foods at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then sold them.</sentence><sentence id="173">Well he was regarded a Capitalist.</sentence><sentence id="174">He was taken the same night, but he said that he was a false Deutschner(ph), he was not, he was actually a half Polish, half-Ukrainian Christian.</sentence><sentence id="175">Well he was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And he escaped, my father didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Just for the clarification here, we're talking about your stepfather?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Was there fear on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, was it better or worse than the Romanians who were hunting down people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Yes and no.</sentence><sentence id="192">A very difficult thing to answer.</sentence><sentence id="193">The people who were not arrested and who were friendly towards the Soviet Union, didn't feel that they had anything to fear.</sentence><sentence id="194">They thought that it would be just the very rich people who, who should be treated that way, because they, they really</sentence><sentence id="196">shouldn't be so rich.</sentence><sentence id="197">But very slowly, it became clear to everybody that you couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="198">Even though they said you had freedom to say anything, you knew that you couldn't, you couldn't even think against them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: It was a good life there, huh?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Yes, I think it was.</sentence><sentence id="245">The parents and grandparents kept talking about the good old time of Kaiser Francioseph(ph).</sentence><sentence id="246">They loved that Kaiser.</sentence><sentence id="247">And they were very assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="248">They, in fact, didn't believe that anything could happen to them because they, in the first World War they served as Austrians, they got medals and awards and they were proud of that, they, they just couldn't believe that this could happen.</sentence><sentence id="249">They also couldn't believe that a civilized <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could do any harm to people.</sentence><sentence id="250">It was strange.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="274">And it's interesting that we had, when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> many, many years later, somewhere, we had found in a, an old issue of the New York Times, that a very small article that said that people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchavina(ph</span>) had asked Comrade Stalin, had requested to be resettled into the interior of <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span>, for fear of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="275">And that Comrade Stalin had agreed to it.</sentence><sentence id="276">And this was the deportations that happened in the middle of the night against, nobody was asked, nobody asked to be resettled.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2217">A: I don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="2218">Because when it happened, when it began to happen to me, let's call it since 1937 it began, because the anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was already rampant at that time, this was the</sentence><sentence id="2220">3 ___ time.</sentence><sentence id="2221">And I was 16.</sentence><sentence id="2222">That's when, that's when it began.</sentence><sentence id="2223">To be, it, when it became conscious.</sentence><sentence id="2224">It happened at the time when, I don't how I would have turned out had this not happened, I have no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2289">A: Yeah, yes, exactly, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="2290">I think a personal experience of someone controlling my life like that, I, I can't think.</sentence><sentence id="2291">But I also thought that, because of Sam, who protected me, I think that I was only too willing to be protected and too grateful and to this day I'm grateful to him.</sentence><sentence id="2292">But I have no idea, I think I, I think that in some ways we were also fortunate with the way things came, were.</sentence><sentence id="2293">But, whether we were fortunate or smart, I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2299">Q: You know, it's interesting to me that you refer, you've referred several times to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and how awful it was and yet as I understand it, you really were only there a few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2300">And this seems to be such a...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2313">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2314">We didn't call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2315">Only the fact that Sam was used in a certain profession and I was used as his assistant and that we were taken every morning and brought back every evening, maybe it made it a little easier, you know, but it also</sentence><sentence id="2317">5 made it a little more dangerous, because every time Sam would have made a mistake on one of the soldiers or officers, that would have been the end of him.</sentence><sentence id="2318">So, so he was in very big danger and I call that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, even though it was called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
