<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">-- ended up her life the way it eventually did.</sentence><sentence id="2">And that I find probably the most unforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3">And let me say now, at the outset, that what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, while it was unique in the history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great battles and great suffering among other peoples of the world, I have come to the conclusions after many, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could happen anyplace, given certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly inappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, this is -- these are the people that were able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4">I think all peoples are capable of doing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: What were your parents" names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My mother's name was Anna Rosenthal Greenberg.</sentence><sentence id="12">She was born Irena Bayata, but they called her Anna.</sentence><sentence id="13">My father was Benjamin Greenberg and they called him Benno Greenberg.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: And -- and your brother's name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: My -- my brother's name was Heinz and he was my twin and he now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and he's a grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="20">So I mean, you know, it's wonderful, when you think about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: And tell me a little bit about your late sister.</sentence><sentence id="24">What was her name and what did she die of?</sentence><sentence id="25">Interview with Margitta Cooper , January 4, 2002</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: My -- my sister's name was Margot and she was absolutely exquisite, I have a picture of her.</sentence><sentence id="27">She was angelic.</sentence><sentence id="28">Not only because she died, because people become angelic after they're dead, but from -- everybody said that she was just a sweet and gentle child.</sentence><sentence id="29">And her death not only devastated my parents, but I think my mother's brothers, her uncles and my -- my grandmother, and I think that -- she was really beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="30">I mean, she looked like the Rosenthals.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Wha-What did she die of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diphtheria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">She was fine.</sentence><sentence id="35">They had sent her to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to reco -- recuperate, and I think from what now that -- I was in the <span class="DLF">medical field</span> a little bit for -- for a long time, she -- I think they must have given her digitalis to strengthen the heart, and I think they o -- overdosed and I think it killed her.</sentence><sentence id="36">She was only 10 years old.</sentence><sentence id="37">So I think that's precisely what happened, although, you know, it was so long ago, I mean, was 1928, so it's difficult to -- but they did bring back the body from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- it had to be a -- a frightful event for my parents.</sentence><sentence id="38">And -- but as I said, you know, my childhood was pretty normal.</sentence><sentence id="39">I was -- after the -- do you want to hear this?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: Oh yeah, yeah, | -- it was, but again, it was much worse after Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="348">After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> it became flagrant.</sentence><sentence id="349">And then -- let me say that at the time, you a -- also -- after -- even after Kristallnacht, there were still people who did not, in any way, react to us in a negative way, who became overtly anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="350">The people who were really anti-Semitic were always anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="351">Now the children were the surprise.</sentence><sentence id="352">The children who became so -- who became, you know, really taunted us and began -- made life so difficult for us.</sentence><sentence id="353">Those are the ones -- the mu -- most of the u -- most of the Christians ignored it, ignored us.</sentence><sentence id="354">They might not have been friendly, but they were not overtly -- they were not overtly cruel or anything.</sentence><sentence id="355">It was the children more than anything else, and some of the teachers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: When you and your brother were walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you said in some [indecipherable] can you describe that in more detail what your -- what thoughts were going through your head as a young child, when that was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
