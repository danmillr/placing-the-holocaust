<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Maybe, or did -- what -- what -- how did you feel when -- ho-how did you feel about yourself at that time, and how did you -- did -- did you have anger?</sentence><sentence id="349">Did you have --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Thad --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: -- compassion, did you have --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: How about your father?</sentence><sentence id="383">He was fantasy, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: He was fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="385">My mother didn't yell and scream a lot, but she would keep a grudge.</sentence><sentence id="386">She would keep it in her.</sentence><sentence id="387">My father, you can just spark him and he'll scream and rant, but on the most part, it's done and over with, you know?</sentence><sentence id="388">And you want to hide sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="389">I remember going into it -- he would -- he would pick fights, even when there were fights not even there.</sentence><sentence id="390">We'd go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and he would pick a fight with a salesman, or if he didn't like something a woman said, he would pick a fight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="398">But it would be done.</sentence><sentence id="399">It would fester with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="400">We had a neighbor who was</sentence><sentence id="402">German, and they would always have fights, always have fights.</sentence><sentence id="403">My father would take him to <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, or they would -- screaming at each other.</sentence><sentence id="404">But the odd thing is that his oldest daughter was my babysitter.</sentence><sentence id="405">So it was an interesting relationship.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: No, no, there was a feud in my family.</sentence><sentence id="418">Okay, I don't know the feud very well.</sentence><sentence id="419">The feud started, I heard, when I was born.</sentence><sentence id="420">From one of my cousins, a first cousin, I heard that my father would -- and my father still is a very generous and giving man.</sentence><sentence id="421">And he was probably very generous and giving to them.</sentence><sentence id="422">And when I was born -- cause they had waited 10 years for me and they were going to adopt, I guess they realized that the fortune, or whatever my father had amassed wasn't going to go to them, and it was going to go to me.</sentence><sentence id="423">This is what I was told.</sentence><sentence id="424">And there were conflicts and jealousy because my father made it in life and the brothers really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="425">So I didn't meet them, at all.</sentence><sentence id="426">I mean, I never met Leibush at all.</sentence><sentence id="427">I met -- I met David, oh, maybe a couple years before his death.</sentence><sentence id="428">Al I met only once.</sentence><sentence id="429">When I was very small he gave me a book by Edgar Allen Poe.</sentence><sentence id="430">Why I remember this I don't even know.</sentence><sentence id="431">But -- and he was very tall, and I don't really have any other memories of him.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: To the brothers, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="454">Absolutely no relationship whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="455">There was a cousin named Benny, who was my first cousin, who -- maybe when I got married, came to my father and said, I'm not -- I'm not my father's son, I want to start having a relationship back with you.</sentence><sentence id="456">And we became very friendly with him, and I liked him, and -- but they moved to <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> and distance has its, you know, way of cutting into family ties, so I don't see him any more.</sentence><sentence id="457">But I have good memories of him later on in life.</sentence><sentence id="458">My father has a first cousin name -- a nephew named Eddie, who I have not a re -- really a relationship with at all, but he is friendly to my parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1042">A: They were silent.</sentence><sentence id="1043">They gave him an amazing amount of respect.</sentence><sentence id="1044">Probably admiration that he -- he survived and he was a soldier and that he made it, and oh, he fought the Germans, or the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1045">So they respected him, cause a lot of these kids were street kids, and they have a re -- respect of the pecking order.</sentence><sentence id="1046">And he was, you know, lieutenant governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span>, and that was pe -- you know, prestigious position.</sentence><sentence id="1047">And I hope they walked away from that with some knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="1048">We also did a trial where -- we did a rape trial and I made the boys the victim, and had the women of the class on the jury and the judge.</sentence><sentence id="1049">I reversed entire roles.</sentence><sentence id="1050">And that was interesting because I'm very attuned to victims.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1080">so much now, but -- I used to be the one to help them, lead them around, or take care of them, or be assigned to them.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Cause I understood what the underdog was, because I never put myself as saying that I was going through the Holocaust, but I wa -- could always associate myself still close to my parents that it could happen to me, and that I had to protect other people because of that.</sentence><sentence id="1082">That's very strong, I try to make sure that my kids are survivors, so that if ever it should happen to them, that they could survive.</sentence><sentence id="1083">But I -- and I make them very attuned to that -- or I try, and also very proud of who they are, and respect others.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Very important to me.</sentence><sentence id="1085">But I still keep food downstairs, a little extra food, in case something should happen, my husband laughs every snowstorm, you know, why you stock up like for years?</sentence><sentence id="1086">And he doesn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1087">I mean, I can explain it to him, but he doesn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1088">Just this mentality that if anything should happen, I am prepared.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: In -- only in hi -- only in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, but no, not in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, this just not spoken.</sentence><sentence id="1111">I was probably looked at as a very odd person that my parents were survivors.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: Did they know of -- di-did you talk about that at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1116">A: I personally, I talk probably more about it now than I did when I grew up, but no.</sentence><sentence id="1117">But my parents always talked about it, I didn't have to, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1118">And it's also -- and if you have an accent, somebody's gonna go, where are you from?</sentence><sentence id="1119">Even to my parents, it's the first thing out of their mouth.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And they'll say, I'm from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and my father jokes, I'm from, you know, the south -- south Poland. [</sentence><sentence id="1121">indecipherable] a little -- and they'II -- he'll say then they're survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1122">So it comes out very, very quickly, where they're from.</sentence><sentence id="1123">I went back during my <span class="BUILDING">college</span> years to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1124">I went with my mother on a trip.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And that was an interesting experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1136">Q: Because you wanted to go, or because she wanted to go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1138">A: She wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="1139">Well, she wanted to go because there was a man who helped save her life, his name was Mundek, and I -- he was very ill at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And my mother said that he was always in love with her.</sentence><sentence id="1141">He never married.</sentence><sentence id="1142">He'd saved 12 girls.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And she wanted me to meet him.</sentence><sentence id="1144">And so my sophomore year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and at that time you couldn't go as a Jewish group to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Didn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="1146">You had to go with a Roman Catholic group, led by a priest to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">And that's how we went, and that's -- it was very interesting because I never told them in</sentence><sentence id="1149">the group that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1150">I mean, I never brought it up.</sentence><sentence id="1151">My mother didn't bring it up either.</sentence><sentence id="1152">She basically said, you know, let us blend in right now.</sentence><sentence id="1153">And I remember the priest took a liking to me, and he always tried to make me go to confession to all these different <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1154">And I kind of bowed out.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And we had one week that we were spending with our friends, with the people that helped save my father, and the people who helped save my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1156">But while we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tour group</span>, there was also a -- a group, they were the fir -- there was a group of first Christians or something like that, they were from <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, and they don't cross themselves either, and they don't go into confession.</sentence><sentence id="1157">So I kind of said I -- I can't do that, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1158">And he had no clue that I was Jewish, none.</sentence><sentence id="1159">And there was a woman there who right away everybody knew she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1160">She also had a -- she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, so she had the symbol.</sentence><sentence id="1161">But even before, they kind of knew.</sentence><sentence id="1162">They used to tell Jewish jokes on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and they still made fun of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1163">Hardly any Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time and they still made fun of us.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And I -- and I knew then how my mother felt.</sentence><sentence id="1165">I used to wear a Moses holding the 10 commandments.</sentence><sentence id="1166">I wore it on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">It was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1168">Then we spent a week with the families.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And I met Mundek, but we couldn't talk to each other.</sentence><sentence id="1170">But he was if -- there was like a light in his eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1171">He was a very interesting, very nice man.</sentence><sentence id="1172">But I spent -- we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that -- of the woman who saved my father, because she had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And she had two children my age.</sentence><sentence id="1174">We couldn't speak very well, but they all kind of -- if they knew that</sentence><sentence id="1176">I was Jewish, it was just never brought up.</sentence><sentence id="1177">Holocaust was never brought up, never discussed it.</sentence><sentence id="1178">There was a <span class="DLF">language barrier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1179">But there was one boy who came over who did bring it up.</sentence><sentence id="1180">And -- and we liked each other.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And I said to him, by the way, do you know that I was Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="1182">I had to tell him, I don't know, it's -- something compelled me that I had to tell him who I was.</sentence><sentence id="1183">And he said to me, we're all children of Moses.</sentence><sentence id="1184">But he was the only one of the group who went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1185">So it was very different, but I felt very strange there.</sentence><sentence id="1186">You know, you would 0 -- go with other pe -- I would not -- I mean, he knew I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And of course, I thought the other children knew because of what their parents told them.</sentence><sentence id="1188">But it's just not -- I was told in some parties not to bring it up.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And then we went, you know, to see my father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1190">And I felt -- then I felt anger, because I couldn't -- here was my father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, that didn't belong to him any more, that was taken from him, and I wanted to go up to these people and say, this is my heritage.</sentence><sentence id="1191">My mother told me, you know, obviously, not to do that, not to bring it up, not even to mention we went to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> to have tea.</sentence><sentence id="1192">No one questioned my mother, whether she was Jewish, no one thought about it, and I guess I don't look that Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1193">It was not imprinted across my forehead.</sentence><sentence id="1194">But at the end of the trip was the most interesting part because I sat next to the priest on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1195">And I showed -- he said, where do you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I said I went to <span class="BUILDING">BU</span>, and on my I.D. was the Jewish star.</sentence><sentence id="1196">And he looked at that, and you could see his eyes were widening, and he turned around, and he said,</sentence><sentence id="1198">Interview with Esther Dezube * December 7, 2000 "That -- that looks like a Jewish star."</sentence><sentence id="1199">I said, "It is."</sentence><sentence id="1200">He said, "Are you Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="1201">And I said, "I am."</sentence><sentence id="1202">And he said, "Well, I like you anyway."</sentence><sentence id="1203">And I think to him, he thought he was giving me a compliment.</sentence><sentence id="1204">But, you know, there are two ways to approach those kind of people, yell and screaming, butt your heads, not get anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1205">Shake your head, and be polite.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Show them that you can be better than they.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And then other ways, press your point.</sentence><sentence id="1208">And I -- and I think that's the way that I usually do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1282">Q: When was that trip, roughly?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1296">A: No, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> then, too.</sentence><sentence id="1297">The trip was -- that was also very strange.</sentence><sentence id="1298">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but again remember, we went with a Catholic group.</sentence><sentence id="1299">And now they have tours and say Jews died there.</sentence><sentence id="1300">When we went there, they didn't tell us Jews died there.</sentence><sentence id="1301">The official tour was that many people died there, period.</sentence><sentence id="1302">Not one word that Jews died there.</sentence><sentence id="1303">But you could see that -- the fingernails in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> -- in the <span class="DLF">cement walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1304">You can see imbedded lines that match fingernails in -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1305">And you just have a chill.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I mean, you know, there's just a silence and a chill.</sentence><sentence id="1307">And that's -- you know, you realize that it will never hap -- you're not going to</sentence><sentence id="1309">Interview with Esther Dezube % December 7, 2000 let it happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1310">But that's something for the perspective, versus dwelling on the past.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1327">Q: What was your mother's response to that -- da -- ha -- and what -- what was your relationship to each other at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1329">A: We were close.</sentence><sentence id="1330">That was probably one trip that we were quite close.</sentence><sentence id="1331">I probably was not a very warm child.</sentence><sentence id="1332">My mother wasn't that warm either, I mean, she would hold my hand, and -- and stuff like that, and I didn't want her to hold my hand cause I thought that was not the right thing to do, you know, women holding hands together.</sentence><sentence id="1333">But she would never come and hug and cuddle and kiss me.</sentence><sentence id="1334">And I in turn was not a huggy, cuddly person either.</sentence><sentence id="1335">I'm much more with my children.</sentence><sentence id="1336">But we were close.</sentence><sentence id="1337">I think that we did hold hands then.</sentence><sentence id="1338">It was almost like the world against us, except for these people that we stayed with.</sentence><sentence id="1339">It tends to bind you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1351">Q: Did past become a little concreter in some ways then, because so much -- I imagine [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1352">A: Well, I saw all the pictures, my parents would always show them to me.</sentence><sentence id="1353">So they became affirmed, but not concrete -- any more concrete, because I think they were already concrete.</sentence><sentence id="1354">You know, if you're in a ca -- you can see pictures of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, and be in a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, and it's a very, very different feeling, but they were always in my memories.</sentence><sentence id="1355">| -- I remember once -- this was past <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, but I remember once we were with these young people, and again my parents bring the</sentence><sentence id="1357">Holocaust up right away.</sentence><sentence id="1358">This woman stepped on a bug, and got upset cause she was a vegetarian, and -- and my mother said, well, that's how they used to crush children in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1359">You know, there was a moment of silence after that, what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="1360">It's a very awkward pause.</sentence><sentence id="1361">But that's -- and -- and they never saw that it would be an awkward pause cause they had to keep telling.</sentence><sentence id="1362">You know, some don't tell, some don't let go.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And I think I had one of each.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1364">Q: I think that's probably a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> again to switch the tapes.</sentence><sentence id="1365">So this is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Esther Dezube.</sentence></p></dialogue>
