<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: -- when the troubles started in the 30's, you had to trace your ancestry back as far as you could go, because by 1938 - deg39, they were picking up people who were not so-called Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="191">See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and they were mostly, I suppose at that time looking for those people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: So it was --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: And this was a specialized <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and unfortunately only the Catholic school system had it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Specialized in what way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: It's more of an art oriented <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="240">and non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went.</sentence><sentence id="242">I don't mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes actually, so they had maybe I don't know whether -- the first year I think maybe we had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left.</sentence><sentence id="243">They're maybe were two or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish girls, other than being in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them no, I don't think I was really friendly with any of them.</sentence><sentence id="244">That were strange over there, see, because we grew up</sentence><sentence id="246">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006 9 separated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="247">We only wil -- saw Jewish kids.</sentence><sentence id="248">So by the time you were a teenager in your late teens in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> it's -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Was that by choice or by official design that you'd -- you stayed amongst yourselves?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: I don't think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Would you -- how would you -- I'm thinking in terms of many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American cities</span> where blacks live on one side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whites live on another side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, where -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can't live together, they often don't, and I'm wondering was it a similar situation or was it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="269">There was one <span class="REGION">area</span> where most -- were more dominated by Jewish people, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than that, no.</sentence><sentence id="270">There was no <span class="REGION">area</span> where you had to live.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: That was my question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: No, no, no, no, no, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="276">Cause I know in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe there had been the remnants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> from previous eras.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtetl</span>, yes --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Right.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="283"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0006 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: -- I know, and I've been arguing that.</sentence><sentence id="285">I never lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span>, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: That's what I was trying to establish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: At least not in my time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="293">So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Not close friends, no.</sentence><sentence id="295">But by the time I got to that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, it was already troubled times.</sentence><sentence id="296">Hitler was already on the <span class="DLF">horizons</span> and as sweet as the nuns were -- there were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly forever, because they were nice human beings.</sentence><sentence id="297">But then there were others who just as soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Tell me about them.</sentence><sentence id="299">What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you got that feeling about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> and there's -- during the time you go and you have to say some kind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this particular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray because what's happening out in the world.</sentence><sentence id="303">And in those days a lot of Jewish people did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did.</sentence><sentence id="304">Nothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> centuries back -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="305">I remember when we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> already, there was a young woman</sentence><sentence id="307">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0006 11 doctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="308">Her parents converted during the first World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian.</sentence><sentence id="309">And yet she was considered a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I'm unclear, was she saying that with malice or with concern?</sentence></p></dialogue>
