Helen Bamber, tell me about your background first of all, where you grew up and the family you grew up in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: I grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">My father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">My mother was born in the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, of course, as it was then.</sentence><sentence id="8">Their parents came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> respectively.</sentence><sentence id="9">Interestingly, one of my grandfathers was actually born, we found out many years later, in what was -- and my pronunciation is poor, forgive me, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswiecim</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">And that sent shivers down our spine many years later.</sentence><sentence id="11">Now, it wasn't a happy <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">My father was an accountant.</sentence><sentence id="13">He was a very obsessional man, and during most of my childhood -- I grew up, by the way -- I was born in 1925.</sentence><sentence id="14">So I grew up in the years of unemployment, <span class="DLF">dole queues</span>, and the rise of fascism.</sentence><sentence id="15">And I think this combination absorbed my father completely inasmuch as he was something of a visionary.</sentence><sentence id="16">He could see, I believe, what was going to happen in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="17">He was bilingual, he spoke German perfectly, and a number of other languages, and I've never understood how it was that a man who was not -- you know, was quite simply educated in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, a good scholar, but how it was that he spoke the languages he did, and how he could be bilingual in German.</sentence><sentence id="18">I never understood that, and I don't now, but he was.</sentence><sentence id="19">So, as an only child, in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">north London</span>, with diminishing financial resources, as my father's activities on behalf of people who were -- who needed to leave Nazi Germany became more -- how can I say more active, or more -- yes, more active.</sentence><sentence id="20">And as I was exposed to</sentence><sentence id="22">his version of events, his -- his horror of fascism, his fear of anti-Semitism rising in Europe, and indeed, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where we -- I mean, I was frequently aware of Mosely's fascists marching through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">north London</span>, and the east end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">I'm losing my thread, but what I'm trying to do is to give a background about an only child growing up in what was later a working class area, because we had to move from a rather sumptuous <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to something very modest.</sentence><sentence id="24">Was a - - a -- a kind of <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of -- of s-something bordering on fear and apprehension of what might happen in the future.</sentence><sentence id="25">My father insisted that we listened to the broadcasts from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which he would translate.</sentence><sentence id="26">So that as a young child, I -- | was exposed to quite a lot of my father's understanding and vision, but also his fears, and my own.</sentence><sentence id="27">N -- my mother tried hard to avoid all this by -- and it wasn't that she didn't care, it was that like so many people of her time, and h -- and as is always the case, she actually couldn't face the possibility of what might happen.</sentence><sentence id="28">She began to disengage as much as she could.</sentence><sentence id="29">As my father's activities became, as I said earlier, more -- more active, there were refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, en route perhaps for somewhere else, but would often stay in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for some days, weeks, and -- and as a sickly child, on top of everything else, because I had what later was thought to have been TB, tuberculosis, which is very common in my time, many children had it, I was bi -- be -- I was bedridden for a lot of my -- of the winters of my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="30">And they -- there were -- people who came and stayed would often come and talk to me, sit on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and talk to me, but they wouldn't talk to me about childhood events, or childhood dreams, and -- and fantasies, and i -- yo-you know, celebration.</sentence><sentence id="31">It was about what happened to them, and what was -- what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">And I remember there was a pianist who stayed with us, who I disliked very much.</sentence><sentence id="33">I found him pompous, although he played beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="34">And he came and sat on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> frequently.</sentence><sentence id="35">But he made a great change in my life, in my childish -- my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="36">He said to</sentence><sentence id="38">me, "You know, you don't have to be ill like this.</sentence><sentence id="39">If you want to, you can get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> when I leave this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and you can walk round the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, touch all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, and get back into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and say to yourself, I am now in control of myself."</sentence><sentence id="40">Now, I disliked him more than ever when he said this, because of course, illness can be a retreat, and a way of avoiding issues.</sentence><sentence id="41">But I did exactly what he said.</sentence><sentence id="42">I got up and I walked round the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I touched everything, and I said to myself. "</sentence><sentence id="43">I can make changes, I can be in control."</sentence><sentence id="44">I wasn't very confident, but I said it.</sentence><sentence id="45">And I don't know, I think that was a -- a turning point for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Looking back, how do you think that the family atmosphere, and your father's outlook on life influenced your personality, and your thinking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: I think it was a very hard upbringing in some ways, although I don't want to magnify it.</sentence><sentence id="94">I was very moved by my father.</sentence><sentence id="95">I still am when I look back and I think of his loneliness and his despair later on, when the Holocaust came.</sentence><sentence id="96">But I was always off -- I was also attracted by my mother's social skills, her interest in clothes, her interest in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, and her desire for me to be somehow -- I don't know, something very special.</sentence><sentence id="97">Not unusual, of course, in Jewish families.</sentence><sentence id="98">But it was a conflict for me, and I was torn between them both, really.</sentence><sentence id="99">Later they divorced; when I was in my late teens, they divorced.</sentence><sentence id="100">But it was an unhappy <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, and I'm not sure that I -- I mean, | think I had a good role model for my future in human rights.</sentence><sentence id="101">I'm not sure that I had a good role model in terms of relationships, and in terms of parenting.</sentence><sentence id="102">I learned, though, as a -- as an only child in an unhappy <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, with these issues, I learned how to negotiate, and I learned how to compromise.</sentence><sentence id="103">And these, I think, are skills I have.</sentence><sentence id="104">And that comes not only from later experience, but I learned it in the <span class="BUILDING">family home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: You -- you spent your teenage years, I believe, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during the war.</sentence><sentence id="118">Tell me about what that experience was like, and -- and how you think now, looking back, that it affected you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: I was brought up in the war -- I mean, I -- forgive me, I grew up in the war.</sentence><sentence id="125">What can I say about it?</sentence><sentence id="126">In some ways, it was almost -- it's crazy to say this, it was almost a relief from the fear of be -- of anti-Semitism, and being specially chosen, which was always my fear if the Germans came, specially chosen for annihilation.</sentence><sentence id="127">So in other words, when I was involved in a bombing incident, when I was fire watching in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central London</span>, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central London</span> was terribly bombed, and was buried, albeit it -- it -- it wasn't as dramatic or terrible as it sounds, but I was -- I wasn't hurt.</sentence><sentence id="128">I suppose in modern terminology, I was somewhat traumatized, and I still find it difficult to go downstairs because I was on -- I was -- I was firewatching in a <span class="BUILDING">solicitor's office</span>, and standing on some <span class="DLF">steps</span>, going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where all the documents were kept with little bits of pink ribbon tying them up.</sentence><sentence id="129">And I was going -- there was only about four or five steps, but as I stood on the <span class="DLF">top step</span>, the <span class="DLF">steps</span> collapsed under me.</sentence><sentence id="130">And I think that yes, I do have a phobia from that time, but I also know that -- that I ti -- I felt at the time, and I still do, that I was taking my chances with the rest of the population, and that I wasn't being particularly chosen at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="131">And so in a mad sort of way, the war had it's reliefs for me, although it killed, in another bombing incident, an aunt of mine, who had a great influence on me, who was considerably left wing.</sentence><sentence id="132">Did a lot of work in the east end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, working with the Communists, and the Jewish community there in trying to combat the activities of Mosely's fascists.</sentence><sentence id="133">And she was involved in the much glorified battle of <span class="DLF">Cable Street</span>, which is an incident where when Mosely was going to march down one particular area of the east end, the people of the east end brought out all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, their -- their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span>, their -- their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen equipment</span>, and they blocked the <span class="DLF">roads</span> of the east end.</sentence><sentence id="134">And for me, with a father who was growing into despair as to what was happening in Europe, this simple act meant a great deal to me.</sentence><sentence id="135">It was about resistance, and it was about finding ways, even if they didn't succeed ultimately</sentence><sentence id="137">in making a stand, in making a statement.</sentence><sentence id="138">So my aunt was another very strong influence in my life because she represented anything but despair.</sentence><sentence id="139">She was vigorous, she was sexy.</sentence><sentence id="140">She had the strangest advice as to how to behave in any sexual encounter.</sentence><sentence id="141">She was a fascinating, vigorous, lovely woman, and -- with boyfriends, and shocking everybody, platinum blonde hair, but also doing these fantastic things.</sentence><sentence id="142">An -- and she was a -- she was a very interesting influence in my life, and it was a terrible blow to me when she -- when she and her fiance, someone I think she might have married, were killed when the <span class="BUILDING">Cafe de Paris</span> had a direct hit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: <span class="BUILDING">Cafe de Paris</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: The cafe de p -- ki -- the Cafe de P-Paris was a very famous <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> for dancing, many soldiers and people would -- would go there on leave, and it was rather posh, and I think not inexpensive, but -- and it was supposed to be absolutely safe.</sentence><sentence id="167">I don't know why people talk about something being absolutely safe.</sentence><sentence id="168">It had a direct hit.</sentence><sentence id="169">Her body was never found, and I remember going with my mother to try and identify various objects that were lined up somewhere in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where people queued and looked at these objects.</sentence><sentence id="170">Handbags, shoes, this kind of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: You were brought up with this kind of terrible fear of what might happen to the Jews of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="177">When did you actually begin to discover, and to understand what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: I think I always understood, because my father had understood what was going on in the -- in -- in terms of the annihilation of the Jewish people and the Gypsies, and the mentally defective.</sentence><sentence id="181">He had read men ka -- "Mein Kampf," he had read other documents.</sentence><sentence id="182">The information actually was there for anyone who wanted to know it.</sentence><sentence id="183">Members of <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> denied all knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and people -- I think including my father, but I'm not sure about this -- did lobby, and did try to persu -- persuade government of what was going on , but I don't think that - - that anybody really wanted to listen at the time of -- of a total war situation.</sentence><sentence id="184">And maybe for</sentence><sentence id="186">other reasons as well.</sentence><sentence id="187">So I always knew, I always knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">It was no secret in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that people were being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and murdered.</sentence><sentence id="189">We weren't -- I -- I don't always know -- now when I look back, it's difficult to be accurate.</sentence><sentence id="190">Whether the details were known, I'm not su -- to me, I'm not sure, but certainly the word <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, in my German -- my father would say it in German, was well known in my <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">So it wasn't a stranger to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: What years are we talking about here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: I'm talking about the -- the years -- the -- the -- the -- all during the war really, th-the war years.</sentence><sentence id="209">The forties.</sentence><sentence id="210">The 1941, "42, 43, were years in which whilst the war was going on, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was being bombed, my father was talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: I believe there was an exhibition of photographs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">An exhibition of photographs from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which had a very profound impact on you.</sentence><sentence id="216">Can you recall how old you were when you went to see that <span class="BUILDING">exhibition</span> and what -- what stayed in your mind from that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: No, I -- I think actually the exhibition of photographs came -- yes, that's right, there was an exhibition of photographs that was shown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">It wasn't the photographs that shocked me so much as the attitude of people.</sentence><sentence id="222">And I think that if I'm not mistaken, that the photographs were discontinued; that means to say the exhibition was discontinued because of people's reactions.</sentence><sentence id="223">Now, I'm not quite sure what that reaction was, but you know, after the war people did not want to believe, they did not want to understand the totality of what had happened, and they didn't really -- they had their own preoccupations with the war, and loss, and deprivation, and rationing, and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="224">And to bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to people the atrocities of the Nazis in that -- to that extent, I think either didn't move people in the right way -- but whatever happened, it didn't -- I don't think that it was received with -- with -- with real comprehension, I think, with</sentence><sentence id="226">real under -- |-let's say how difficult it was for anyone to understand what really happened.</sentence><sentence id="227">It wasn't the pictures though, I think, that influenced me to -- to want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="228">I think that I'd started to think about it for quite a long time, and I -- I'm -- and in -- it's very interesting that the more one talks about this, the more you begin to understand, or the more you think about it, you begin to understand your motives.</sentence><sentence id="229">People often ask me why did I want to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, wh -- was it some voyeuristic reason, was it -- what was it that made me want to go and to work for the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="230">And I think it really, now talking today, I think it wasn't only my father, because my father was sunk in despair at the end of the war, whereas everybody was rejoicing, and even I was rejoicing, my father was despairing because of the -- the catastrophic events that had happened, and the -- the death of so many people, not only in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but the -- the -- the -- th-the -- the -- that -- the -- the awfulness of that war, I think just -- just crushed him, and he was very despairing.</sentence><sentence id="231">He also had his own personal reasons for -- he was living alone then, and he was very sad.</sentence><sentence id="232">But I think it was also my aunt, because my aunt was the -- the very opposite, in a way, to my father.</sentence><sentence id="233">And her belief was you must do something, you can do something, you can do anything if you want to.</sentence><sentence id="234">And so I suppose it was my father's knowledge, and my aunt's kind of message about go for it, anybody can do it, do something, make a statement, however -- even if you're waving your arms and nobody's watching, do it, was what she was about.</sentence><sentence id="235">I think that's really what influenced me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Do you remember actually taking this decision?</sentence><sentence id="255">And how old were you at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: I found an organization called the Jewish Relief Unit, that was in formation before the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="259">I think I was then about 18, and I made some enquiries and I went to see them, and they announced that I was very young, but they -- they said yes, they'd consider me.</sentence><sentence id="260">And I joined the <span class="BUILDING">relief unit</span> in the hope that I would be able to go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Let me ask you something.</sentence><sentence id="271">Could you tell me what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> consisted of, who organized it, how it was run, how big it was?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="414">A: My journey remains really a bit of a mystery to me myself.</sentence><sentence id="415">I was then just 20 by the way, when I went.</sentence><sentence id="416">I think I was -- have to be very careful about this, but I think I just -- I was just 20 years old.</sentence><sentence id="417">And I had uniforms, we all had.</sentence><sentence id="418">We had officer's uniform, we had officer's rank.</sentence><sentence id="419">And an ordinary khaki kind of ordinary wear.</sentence><sentence id="420">I don't know what you call it now.</sentence><sentence id="421">It's awful that I don't, but anyway, I traveled in my khaki ordinary, and I traveled with the yellow star on my shoulder, my left shoulder, which is what we had elected to do.</sentence><sentence id="422">And that in itself was an undertaking.</sentence><sentence id="423">So not only was I kitted out beyond belief with a -- a kind of a canvas thing that was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">mobile bath</span>, or whatever, and a kit bag that really I could barely lift.</sentence><sentence id="424">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedroll</span> and all kinds of -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedroll</span> was very important later on, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="425">The -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">mobile bath</span>, I never knew it's -- what it was intended to do, but it -- I used to sort of keep all my dirty underwear in it because I could sort of snap it together when anybody came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="426">You know, it was one of those things, it sort of opened out with two kind of sticks, and it wa -- oh, I don't know, it was a kind of ghastly thing.</sentence><sentence id="427">But it was very good for underwear and you could smack the two pieces together when anybody came in, and nobody could see.</sentence><sentence id="428">So that's what I did with that.</sentence><sentence id="429">And there was all kinds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">equipment</span> that one didn't actually need.</sentence><sentence id="430">I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedroll</span> was very important.</sentence><sentence id="431">So I was in uniform, with a cap, you know, a beret, and m-my khaki,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="434">2 my ghastly shoes and navy blue underwear and -- and the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="435">And why I traveled on my own I do not know, but I think there was a very difficult procedure before anybody was allowed to go.</sentence><sentence id="436">There was a very careful vetting of every individual, not necessarily verbally, I mean I didn't meet anybody, but I know that there was one woman who belonged to the Communist party, who was not allowed to go.</sentence><sentence id="437">Which was a very great disappointment to all of us who knew and loved her.</sentence><sentence id="438">So, there was a very careful vetting of each individual, and I think there was a fear by the officials involved, that Jews going out were in some way -- Jews going out to work in the former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were somehow either a provocation or a difficulty, an embarrassment, difficult to control.</sentence><sentence id="439">Whatever it was, it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="440">And so everybody was vetted very carefully, and although we came under the auspices directly of <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, we were also responsible directly also, to the British military government.</sentence><sentence id="441">At least we were in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, that means to say those of us who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">I had to go -- I mean, my final destination was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span>, which I -- I kept spelling in my head all the time, E-i-l-s. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="443">It was difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="444">I'd spoke some German by the way, because I'd learned from my father enough German to get by.</sentence><sentence id="445">And the worst of all was that I went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Victoria</span> -- and I remember people were very helpful to me because I'm not very tall, and with all this heavy kit, the soldiers were good, and they would lift things for me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="446">But of course they were also very -- they would also look quite quizzically at -- at the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="447">So I was constantly in conversation, having to explain oneself.</sentence><sentence id="448">Why one was going, what one was doing.</sentence><sentence id="449">And it was the beginning in a way of a kind of role in society, in the public, that was always slightly uncomfortable for me, and it exists to this day, where I have to explain what I'm doing for asylum seekers and refugees.</sentence><sentence id="450">And so I -- I'd already begun then to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: <span class="BUILDING">Nissen huts</span>, yes, in kind of <span class="BUILDING">dormitories</span> on paliasis and so on.</sentence><sentence id="480">And it was -- it was very primitive, and I remember wandering round <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> all on my own and feeling so alone, as I've never felt in my life before.</sentence><sentence id="481">I hadn't been out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> before, which is strange in this day and age, but I had never been out of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="482">And so this was the first time I'd been out.</sentence><sentence id="483">And I was very alone.</sentence><sentence id="484">Eventually we took our turn and we were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="485">And I remember something quite awful about this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because it would always stop at various <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were not a <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">I mean, in other words I couldn't -- you couldn't -- you had no <span class="DLF">platform</span>, you had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, so to speak, without a <span class="DLF">platform</span>, in order to go to wherever you were going to be fed on the way, which again was a kind of <span class="BUILDING">Nissen hut</span>, specially prepared for the soldiers en</sentence><sentence id="488">4 <span class="DLF">route</span>.</sentence><sentence id="489">And you would sit at a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and -- and be fed.</sentence><sentence id="490">And I had the utmost difficulty with my height, in being able to mount this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">And this was one of the -- the extraordinary things that preoccupied me on the journey, all k-kind of, sort of incidental ridiculous things, not about the seriousness of my task, but how in heaven's name I was going to get up and down this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without making a complete idiot of myself.</sentence><sentence id="492">And usually I had to be hauled up and pushed from behind.</sentence><sentence id="493">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ricketed along, and there was one <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that we crossed when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, when the German guard, or person on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came through carrying a lantern.</sentence><sentence id="494">Achtung, achtung, and inviting us all to stand at one side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> so that we actually balanced it properly, because there was a danger that the -- you know, that -- I don't know, that maybe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would topple over.</sentence><sentence id="495">Whatever it was, that's what we all did.</sentence><sentence id="496">And then there were the children on the way.</sentence><sentence id="497">And if -- you know, the journey was a bit of a nightmare because I was so terrified that I would not find myself at this tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- no, it wasn't <span

all my stuff.</sentence><sentence id="507">And I remember walking down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and walking into the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="508">And I remember hearing German, seeing</sentence><sentence id="510">5 German lettering, an-and this somehow <span class="BUILDING">German shops</span> and the names of things in German, and German voices, and a s -- a terrible sense of panic.</sentence><sentence id="511">And it was the -- didn't -- doesn't -- didn't happen to me very often, but I really for the moment was frozen.</sentence><sentence id="512">And I remember standing there and thinking, "My God," you know, "what have I done?"</sentence><sentence id="513">I'm in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- it isn't the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but you know -- I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I'm with all this stuff.</sentence><sentence id="514">And I actually had to get the

go.</sentence><sentence id="516">I think somebody did help me, and I was standing there.</sentence><sentence id="517">A British officer came up in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">And of course, this is what happens, and you learn this in post-war situations.</sentence><sentence id="519">There is a kind of help that doesn't normally exist that you -- you suddenly get used to.</sentence><sentence id="520">He drove up and he said, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="521">And I said, "I -- I have to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eilshausen</span>."</sentence><sentence id="522">He said, "Where the devil is that?"</sentence><sentence id="523">I said, "I haven't a clue."</sentence><sentence

remember there was some sort of provision there, and I -- I cleaned myself up a bit.</sentence><sentence id="528">I must have been filthy because the week in <span

remember eating anything at all, except on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="531">And then he came down, and he was very efficient, rather like something you see in

id="828">And it was very difficult, it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="829">It was a mother showing a picture of -- of her husband, her son.</sentence><sentence id="830">She maintained, as did her daughter, and I believe it to be so, that when the Russians came in to where they were living in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span>, they were both raped many times and in front of

id="905">But whatever, the people</sentence><sentence id="907">4 were incarcerated there in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="908">And the <span

lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="916">I met the unit -- the workers.</sentence><sentence id="917">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one, which had been burned down.</sentence><sentence id="918">I saw the mounds, these huge mounds where had -- which had formed the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="919">It was very -- there was always about that <span class="NPIP">place</span> particularly, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> one, there was this strange, sweet smell which I -- I know to be the smell of death.</sentence><sentence id="920">I believe it to be, but I always refer to it as the smell of geraniums, because that's what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="921">It was like taking the leaves of the geraniums and crushing them in your hand and then smelling them.</sentence><sentence id="922">And it's -- it's a sweet, dank smell, and that was the smell.</sentence><sentence id="923">And I've never forgotten it.</sentence><sentence id="924">And sometimes I'm reminded of it when the smell returns, that kind of dank smell.</sentence><sentence id="925">And this sense of awfulness, the sense of death was there in that <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> that was empty.</sentence><sentence id="926">There were no bodies, there was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="927">There were no birds, nothing stirred, it was just a terrible, empty <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="928">And yet you -- you felt all the time as though someone was behind you, or someone was by the side of you.</sentence><sentence id="929">You felt very uneasy.</sentence><sentence id="930">I -- I know that I went there the first day, and I went there many times with other people who were involved in some kind of mourning.</sentence><sentence id="931">They may be people who had come as Jewish soldiers -- much later, this was much later -- or they were the inmates, although very few of them went there.</sentence><sentence id="932">But I went there sometimes, and I attended the ceremony there, where the monument was erected, the first monument, in memory.</sentence><sentence id="933">I believe there's a picture somewhere of my unit marching.</sentence><sentence id="934">It's somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">Vina library</span>, and I've never been to see it, but I believe it exists, because people have told me that it does, and they</sentence><sentence id="936">5 recognize me, mainly I think because I was very small, and I was in front for that reason.</sentence><sentence id="937">But I returned many times, and I spent many days there, and I spent a long period in the winter, because I remember sleeping in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span> with all my clothes on in the very cold winters that followed.</sentence><sentence id="938">And what was I doing there?</sentence><sentence id="939">And that's the difficulty, I can't really remember that [had a particular role as I had in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="940">I went and I talked, and I can't remember anybody asking me to do that, or seeing any value in it.</sentence><sentence id="941">So maybe I elected to go.</sentence><sentence id="942">When I knew that a driver or somebody was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, which was very frequent, people frequently went there with provisions or with papers, or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="943">There was no other way of communicating than by going somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="944">The telephone systems were down, and it was very difficult to make telephone calls.</sentence><sentence id="945">And so it was -- the easiest thing was to always go to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">So it is not surprising that I elected to go, and I elected to go I think because over time I found that by talking to people -- that by receiving the information that they gave me, was in itself a v -- a v -- a value.</sentence><sentence id="947">That doesn't sound very profound, but people who give the most terrible information, of death, destruction, loss.</sentence><sentence id="948">Who rock with misery and despair, who are desperately fearful, who want to die, many of them, but can't, it's very important to receive that information in a way that says to people, I am your witness, I am here to tell your

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1572">A: Well, first of all it meant that as far as the officials were concerned, the word survivor or victim had gone out of their vocabulary, and the word displaced persons, which is a sort of anonymous terms for a glob of people, is quite a useful shield, just as we use the word asylum seekers today, so the word displaced persons, and then DPs, even worse, was used.</sentence><sentence id="1573">So the compassion that was there at the very beginning, and the sense of outrage when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated, had gone, in my view.</sentence><sentence id="1574">And the DPs, displaced persons were seen as a problem, number one.</sentence><sentence id="1575">So, in emotional terms, in political terms, in psychological terms, displaced persons meant a nuisance, a -- a problem.</sentence><sentence id="1576">They were vocal, they'd become articulate, they had their committee, they were demanding, they wanted rights.</sentence><sentence id="1577">What wa -- what rights did they want?</sentence><sentence id="1578">They wanted rights within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, as far as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1579">They wanted rights of travel.</sentence><sentence id="1580">They wanted to be able to move about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1581">And that was very difficult because as far as I remember, and this - - this can be corrected by others, the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not allowed to leave or to travel without special permit.</sentence><sentence id="1582">Now, in the early days, many of the young displaced persons went particularly, as I remember, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, mainly to try to find their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1583">They went to their old, former <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to find their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1584">When they got there, they were set upon by the local people, who drove them out, and some killings took place, and some assaults took place.</sentence><sentence id="1585">And the people, bedraggled, and often with torn shoes and bleeding feet, would return back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and back, as it were, behind barbed wire, behind the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="1586">I use barbed wire as a -- as a -- to cover what I mean by that kind of incarceration.</sentence><sentence id="1587">So their options were very limited.</sentence><sentence id="1588">If they wanted to find their relatives -- and this was at the beginning, for the first year or so was the most</sentence><sentence id="1590">1 important as I remember it, was the finding of relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1591">Now we had set up a <span class="BUILDING">search bureau</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1592">And that was one of the things that one of the volunteers in our unit had trained at doing was to set up a <span class="BUILDING">search bureau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1593">People who would come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, again presumably illegally because they would come and there was no way in which they should have been able to enter or to leave, with little bits of like cigarette paper, rolled up paper.</sentence><sentence id="1594">It was probably cigarette paper, with the names of relatives on it, asking has anybody seen or heard of so and so?</sentence><sentence id="1595">And the names would be on these little bits of paper.</sentence><sentence id="1596">And they would give them to you, or they would give them to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1597">They would just hand them out, and you would -- you would do your best.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1670">A: I think my memory is of people wanting to come, many of them, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1671">There was no means by which they really could simply ask to come.</sentence><sentence id="1672">I'm not sure if the American quota system was operating in the way that it normally does.</sentence><sentence id="1673">In other words, so many from -- you know, that you're on the German quota list, or the Romanian, Hungarian, or Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1674">But what I do know was that it wasn't possible simply to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span>, or the <span class="COUNTRY">UK</span>, not really.</sentence><sentence id="1675">Some people did, and they're very proud of it, and they say it as though anybody could have done it, but they must forgive me, I don't believe it was so easy for everybody to do it, otherwise they would have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1676">I-It's -- it was hard for people, they couldn't get out, and they couldn't go anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1677">They couldn't go -- the Iron Curtain had already fallen, they couldn't go to the Iron Curtain countries.</sentence><sentence id="1678">They knew that they would be badly treated if they did.</sentence><sentence id="1679">They knew what was going on by returnees.</sentence><sentence id="1680">And so what were their options?</sentence><sentence id="1681">To find their relatives, to -- but then, as the months passed people realized that nothing had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1682">Perhaps they had found a relative, perhaps they'd accepted that that was it, that nobody was alive.</sentence><sentence id="1683">Or they lived in hopes, but they still wanted to get out.</sentence><sentence id="1684">Outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, of course, the Germans were beginning to mingle, to fraternize with British, American and other soldiers in the various <span class="REGION">zones</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And this came very hard to the inmates, the fact that they were still displaced persons while something else was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1686">I believe then that a hardening of attitudes took place, a realization for many that they were not wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1687">That was the feeling, that nobody really wanted to open their <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1688">I mean, many people returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, some maybe to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1689">But on the whole, people</sentence><sentence id="1691">3 remained, and they didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="1692">So, I think that is when -- and again I must be forgiven by tha -- by those people who see it differently, but I begin that i -- I believe that it was then that the idea of becoming more Zionist, wanting to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is the only solution for their problem.</sentence><sentence id="1693">And I believe it was then that it really became an entrenched desire and need, and mission.</sentence><sentence id="1694">So people began to learn Hebrew if they didn't already know it.</sentence><sentence id="1695">They became more militant.</sentence><sentence id="1696">There were the illegal transportations to -- to cross frontiers to try to get illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And of course, many people perished on the way.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1877">A: Well, the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> would start with, nearly always as far as I remember, with a very raw just sort of exposure on the stage of the destruction of a family.</sentence><sentence id="1878">The scene would start with the mother, father and children sitting round a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, very familiar <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And you can see that they</sentence><sentence id="1881">7 were joyful, that they were engaged with each other, arguing, discussing, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And then you heard the marching toward the <span class="DLF">door</span> that would open on the family in which the Germans would come.</sentence><sentence id="1883">And you saw the family being beaten, being taken, you hear the screams, you see the mother being dragged away.</sentence><sentence id="1884">The whole scene of a family being broken up in front of you was played time and time and time again.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And it would be received in absolute silence.</sentence><sentence id="1886">It was the homage to the family, to the destroyed family.</sentence><sentence id="1887">Whether it was a form of mourning, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="1888">It could -- it could have been.</sentence><sentence id="1889">It was -- or was it more a kind of expression of outrage, letting the world know this is what happened to my family.</sentence><sentence id="1890">I think it was more that than mourning, because it's my view that many Holocaust survivors have never found the way to mourn such grotesque happenings as those that they witnessed and were part of.</sentence><sentence id="1891">So I think it's probably to do with -- to do with exposure of what happened, and wanting the world and everybody to see it.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And as the military government and -- and officials from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> were often invited to th -- these concerts.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Not always, but -- but -- but especially so on some occasions, it's not surprising that they would want to say this.</sentence><sentence id="1894">This is, or was my family, and this is how it was for me.</sentence><sentence id="1895">It was incredibly intimate, and terrible to watch.</sentence><sentence id="1896">And there was never any applause, there was only silence.</sentence><sentence id="1897">But then there would be other things taking part.</sentence><sentence id="1898">I don't remember all of it, but I remember that very often there would be a kind of cabaret element to it, in which there would be songs in Yiddish, or Polish, or whatever, really making fun of, and poking the finger at the establishment of the British rule, the British command and the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, the attitude to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="1899">There would be - - and it would be received with roars of laughter and applause, and at the end of which, of course, everybody stood up and applauded, including the front row of officials from the army, who'd hadn't understood a word of this cabaret.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And I think the <span class="BUILDING">cabaret</span> was done very much in the old-fashioned kind of really sort of German style <span class="BUILDING">cabaret</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1901">You know, it was ironic, it was -- it</sentence><sentence id="1903">8 was -- it's meaning was very, very clear, and I believe it was very, very clever.</sentence><sentence id="1904">I didn't always understand it all.</sentence><sentence id="1905">And so the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was very important, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was important, the workshops, the committees.</sentence><sentence id="1906">The constant badgering for different individuals to move or do something, to go somewhere within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for whatever reason.</sentence><sentence id="1907">Other than that, I cannot really -- I cannot really remember other activities.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1961">A: Yes, it was.</sentence><sentence id="1962">It had its spirit, it had its resilience, it had its sense of life.</sentence><sentence id="1963">And I think that there was a group of younger people there who were going to survive at all costs.</sentence><sentence id="1964">Somehow survival and strength meant a great deal to them, and I think that they very often turned towards the idea of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> as their solution.</sentence><sentence id="1965">Whether the <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that we see now would have been different, I believe it might, but others don't agree with me.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Had <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> taken people more readily and quickly, and quickly solved this question of people remaining within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that once abused them -- I mean, there's nothing much worse than that, really.</sentence><sentence id="1967">Pretty awful stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1968">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1969">It may be a very simplistic way of looking at a very complex problem.</sentence><sentence id="1970">But the sense of not being wanted, and the sense of not being a victim again, was prevalent.</sentence><sentence id="1971">And I have seen it elsewhere.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1995">A: I find it difficult to make claims, I always do.</sentence><sentence id="1996">I think that we were part of it.</sentence><sentence id="1997">We were part of the res -- I don't want to use the word resurrection, but the -- part of the -- we saw ac -- something of the restoration of the human spirit.</sentence><sentence id="1998">We -- we vis -- we actually saw amongst the people, something of the spirit.</sentence><sentence id="1999">Okay, they were angry, and they shouted, but they also laughed and performed, and -- and -- and were quite remarkable in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="2000">I'm not taking responsibility for it.</sentence><sentence id="2001">1 believe we played a small part in it, and I believe that we offered support and resources, and that probably, as is so often the case, we were responsible more for particular individuals being helped than we were for the kind of global picture, if you know what I mean.</sentence><sentence id="2002">I mean, I can think of individuals, and I think of the German woman I spoke to, and who I had quite a lot to do with, and I think that without making too many claims, our relationship was helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2003">The fact that she could speak to me about her husband, about her losses, and the fact that -- no, I just feel somehow I can think of individuals that were helped by my colleagues, and on occasion by myself, but I don't want to make too many claims about what we achieved.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2013">Q: All right, well to get away from the claims, let me ask you about this.</sentence><sentence id="2014">Beginning, let's say with a good --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2015">A: I think the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was important.</sentence><sentence id="2016">I think -- I -- I had less to do with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but I think the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was valuable, and did a great deal for the individuals.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2027">Q: But it -- when you say it was particularly important, in what way do you mean that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2029">A: Well, it was -- i-it was a place for recovery.</sentence><sentence id="2030">And it was of Jewish [indecipherable] and it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2031">It wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">British hospital</span> ostensibly, it was somehow manned by Jewish people helping Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="2032">And I think that was very important because you are very vulnerable when you are helpless.</sentence><sentence id="2033">And they had been helpless many, many times, helpless victims at the mercy of others cruelty and lack of care, and lack of anything.</sentence><sentence id="2034">And I think whatever else we did or didn't do, we did operate it well.</sentence><sentence id="2035">I believe that.</sentence><sentence id="2036">So I think that was a plus.</sentence><sentence id="2037">And I -- I can think of many individuals who were helped along by something.</sentence><sentence id="2038">But if you ask me were we responsible for all that renewal of -- of spirit and -- and so on, I don't think we were responsible.</sentence><sentence id="2039">I think it came from the resilience of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2040">Had we not been there it might have been more difficult, let me put it that way.</sentence><sentence id="2041">That might be the fairest way to put it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2055">Q: Can you describe in -- in greater detail how your relationship with people developed, how when you arrived on this very desolate scene, how you made contact with people, how they reacted to you, and how, if at all, you -- you managed to establish some kind of dialog with them, and -- and draw them out.</sentence><sentence id="2056">Tell me how that process happened there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, as opposed to since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2059">A: I think in the early days -- I mean, this sounds very, again, rather trite, I think, and simplistic, but what I found was very important was to say very little, but to take somebody's hand.</sentence><sentence id="2060">I -- I found that very important, and I sometimes find it important in my present day work.</sentence><sentence id="2061">When there's nothing to say and the situation is so terrible, all you can do is to take somebody's hand</sentence><sentence id="2063">1 and stroke it and hold it and try to indicate through your touch that there is a communication.</sentence><sentence id="2064">So you don't begin with words, you begin with touch, and that's all.</sentence><sentence id="2065">And sometimes I would just walk away.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And they might call me back or I might just walk away and come another day.</sentence><sentence id="2067">But it would be -- I -- I found that was helpful in the very early days, because people were so exhausted, that to take somebody's hand and to hold it was a way of you -- you, as a person, trying to give strength, as it were, to the other person.</sentence><sentence id="2068">So that was all I could do sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="2069">Words came later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2083">Q: And what happens when -- what happened when the words came, and what happened when you didn't have a language in common with the people you were nonetheless communicating with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2085">A: Sometimes people would simply come out with a whole story in explosions.</sentence><sentence id="2086">I've -- I've said before like spitting up, like kind of vomiting something.</sentence><sentence id="2087">So that it would come out stacat -- come out in -- in -- in -- in -- not clearly, not in a coherent way.</sentence><sentence id="2088">And I would sometimes say either in German -- and I would always apologize for speaking German, and I would try to bring in Yiddish words that I'd learned, as much as I could, if I couldn't understand somebody, because there would be other people there, and often people would sort of want to come to help you to understand the story.</sentence><sentence id="2089">So that again is a form of communication.</sentence><sentence id="2090">The fact that you don't understand puts you in a less powerful position, therefore they have the power to inform you.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Without them, I can't understand that person.</sentence><sentence id="2092">So that's always a very useful way of looking at things, to accept your powerlessness, and let them have the power to inform you.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And I would ask for help from them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2103">Q: You've said, I believe, that sometimes you were -- they were angry with you, they didn't want your sympathy, they wanted simply somebody to work out their anger on.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2129">A: I never talked to anyone about it, and I think that was one of the failures in the organization.</sentence><sentence id="2130">It was born of it's time when organizations were not encouraged to speak about feelings, or things that they couldn't achieve.</sentence><sentence id="2131">So that organizations -- and indeed they do it today, and the more difficult the outside circumstances, the more institutions call upon the solutions for the institutions rather than for the people they're there to help.</sentence><sentence id="2132">So we would look at, if we met in the evening, we would talk about the difficulties of transport, or the difficulties of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> being stolen, or an accident.</sentence><sentence id="2133">But we wouldn't talk about how I felt, or anybody else felt.</sentence><sentence id="2134">So there wasn't much of that.</sentence><sentence id="2135">What there was however, was a kind of group -- we would do all sorts of things in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, that requisitioned <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2136">We would sing, we would read poetry, we would read aloud to each other.</sentence><sentence id="2137">We would put on various -- we had one boy who was an extremely good mimic, and Richard Talbor was a very popular tenor of the day, but dear Richard Talbor had a way of performing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> which was quite unique, and a little bit what can I say?</sentence><sentence id="2138">Little bit arrogant and pompous.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And he was wonderful at depicting Richard Talbor.</sentence><sentence id="2140">And so he would sing and perform and we would all act out something.</sentence><sentence id="2141">Or we would dance.</sentence><sentence id="2142">Now we would</sentence><sentence id="2144">3 dance, we would have ballroom dancing, we were very good at this.</sentence><sentence id="2145">We'd put on something or other.</sentence><sentence id="2146">We had some very sentimental Italian songs, you know -- you know, I can't even remember them now, but they were very sentimental, and we would all swoon, we would listen to music.</sentence><sentence id="2147">So we -- we pu -- we had our own activities and we used each other very well I think, in the evenings, but we didn't talk about our feelings.</sentence><sentence id="2148">So my main relief would be laughing at somebody taking off Richard Talbor or somebody else for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="2149">And we'd have all those sort of activities, which was fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2175">A: No, I didn't despair at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2176">When I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, I went through a very difficult phase, one that I haven't experienced since.</sentence><sentence id="2177">| -- I can't explain what it was, it was an inability to work with what I'd seen.</sentence><sentence id="2178">I was absolutely terrified of a recurrence of that kind of happening, I was terrified of it.</sentence><sentence id="2179">And I was sure that it was going to happen again.</sentence><sentence id="2180">And I don't know why I felt that, but I felt afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2181">And I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> and sit and watch film after film after film.</sentence><sentence id="2182">And I had traditional, classical panic attacks, when I would feel overwhelmed with fear.</sentence><sentence id="2183">So a lot of -- of the experience emerged much later, when I was -- when I had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2184">And it was partly fostered by the lack of interest by anybody around me in understanding or listening to what I had to say.</sentence><sentence id="2185">That was very difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="2186">I'd learned a lot of negotiating skills in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and in my family, but I hadn't learned how to deal, and I still find it hard to deal with a bystander, to deal with people who know and don't know, who don't want to hear, and who didn't want to hear.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And I couldn't bear it.</sentence><sentence id="2188">I came back to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was preoccupied with rationing, and which piece of meat they were going to get that week, and any effort I made on my part to communicate what I'd seen, even when I was asked to give official talks about it -- 1 remember going to the east end and talking in a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> there to people.</sentence><sentence id="2191">4 I was actually asking for money, and that may have had something to do with it, but money for the relief -- the Jewish Relief Unit.</sentence><sentence id="2192">I still do that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2193">And I had to ask for money and say what was going on, and I -- I mean, I met with cold, angry stares as much as to say, don't you think we've suffered enough, we've heard enough?</sentence><sentence id="2194">But I think it's partly guilt.</sentence><sentence id="2195">I know now that it's guilt.</sentence><sentence id="2196">And so that before you start, you have to try to reduce that sense of guilt with people that they couldn't and didn't want to do anything or know anything at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2197">And they certainly didn't then.</sentence><sentence id="2198">And I found that the hardest thing of all.</sentence><sentence id="2199">So I despaired when I came back.</sentence><sentence id="2200">I despaired when I came back, and I was really very low, the lowest I've ever been in my life, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2201">Well, almost.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2252">Q: Why did you feel more at ease?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2254">A: I felt more at ease because I knew where I was, and who I was, and what I was doing, and what I was doing it for.</sentence><sentence id="2255">And even if we were failing, or not doing a fantastic job, at least we were trying to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2256">Whereas I came back to <span class="NPIP">nothingness</span>, to people who didn't want to know about it.</sentence><sentence id="2257">And that was -- that was awful.</sentence><sentence id="2258">So I really found myself in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> when I came</sentence><sentence id="2260">5 back.</sentence><sentence id="2261">And the fact that it -- that things had changed, new people, new order had been set up out there, Henry was no longer there.</sentence><sentence id="2262">It meant that it was difficult for me to go back.</sentence><sentence id="2263">And in a way that was quite difficult for me, that whole scene.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2298">A: Well, there was a period which I really can barely remember, in which I wandered about, as I say, going to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2299">Sort of not knowing quite what to do.</sentence><sentence id="2300">I eventually went to work for the Jewish Refugee Committee in their emigration department.</sentence><sentence id="2301">And then finally, from there, I was asked to work with the Committee for the Care of Children from Concentration Camps, working with a group of young children and adolescents who'd been brought to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> whilst I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2302">They came here in 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2303">They were young people, orphans who'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2304">And because of my background I was asked if I would be a caseworker with that organization.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2308">Q: Well, w-why don't you tell me a little bit about that organization and the -- and the work that you did?</sentence><sentence id="2309">We're taking a little pause.</sentence><sentence id="2310">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2311">Before we move on to look in some depth at the work you did when you came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, give me an assessment of what you, your organization, and people like you achieved in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2312">A: I think that had it not been for Henry Lunzer, with his or -- with his sort of military organization, in setting up an administration, and an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that actually could operate within German, and particularly in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, but not only in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>, in terms of provision, in terms of negotiation with British military government for the needs of different individuals and groups, I think that we would have achieved very little.</sentence><sentence id="2313">I think we -- and I think that his support of the need for children to go to the <span class="BUILDING">sanatoria</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was -- was good, and he gave me all the support -- moral support that I needed in order to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2314">I think that he was misjudged, as is often the case, where you have a small -- where you have small resources, and you have a base in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of purse holders and trustees, who have the reputation of the organization at heart, and want it to succeed, but do not, and cannot seem to have a view, a good overview of what Henry Lunzer was trying to achieve there.</sentence><sentence id="2315">So there were inevitable, and there always are, I think, tensions, even in organizations today, which are well known, where the base is held perhaps here, and the outreach work is done in remote parts of the world.</sentence><sentence id="2316">It's very difficult to keep those communications clean and good.</sentence><sentence id="2317">And it certainly was a handicap in -- in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Relief Unit</span> at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2324">Q: Let's move on now then, fairly swiftly to the work that you be -- began to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2326">A: But I -- I did want to -- but I do -- I do really, at this point, want to pay tribute to Henry Lunzer because I think that he was a courageous negotiator and was very knowledgeable.</sentence><sentence id="2327">He</sentence><sentence id="2329">7 knew <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> well, he spoke German well.</sentence><sentence id="2330">He could speak to military government.</sentence><sentence id="2331">I think, you know, somebody needs to say he did a bloody good job, because he did.</sentence><sentence id="2332">Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2341">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2342">Let's talk then about the work that you did once you came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: Once I'd recovered my equilibrium, which took some months before I could actually face the world, really, I was appointed a case worker to the Committee for the Care of Children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2346">| think I mentioned this a little earlier.</sentence><sentence id="2347">It was an organization sponsored and financed by the Central British Fund, and had a board of trustees.</sentence><sentence id="2348">And it's director was a practicing psychoanalyst, called Oskar Friedman, who I'd admired very much.</sentence><sentence id="2349">Who had been the director of a type of [indecipherable] institution in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, until he himself, as a Jew, was expelled and taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> before the war started, and finally released, and who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, or at least came to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> as a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="2350">And he was, as I say, a practicing psychoanalyst, and he brought to the work of the committee, a knowledge of institutional life, and of working with people who in turn were trying to care for what was considered to be a -- in the best sense, perhaps, but nevertheless, a difficult or complex group of young people.</sentence><sentence id="2351">I came back in 1947, in the early months of 1947, so the children had already been, and -- or -- and adolescents had already gone through a kind of preliminary phase of being in special <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, where they were helped with language and many different things.</sentence><sentence id="2352">By the time I got to work with them, they were looking at schooling, at advance study, at apprenticeships, and some kind of future.</sentence><sentence id="2353">Again, we were looking at a very vigorous, articulate, demanding group of young people, competitive.</sentence><sentence id="2354">Now, they were very different in some ways from the people that I remembered from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2355">Their survival, as -- as had the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but let's just make this kind of -- let's mark this difference.</sentence><sentence id="2356">The people in -- the peop -- the pe -- the young</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2359">8 people I was working with had survived the daily selections for work, or for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, through their ability to maintain strength, to maintain totally focused on their survival, nobody else's but their survival.</sentence><sentence id="2360">Although of course, some were concerned with friends and siblings, but basically focused on their own bodily survival.</sentence><sentence id="2361">They had to prove their strength, their capacity to work another day.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Silence, not reacting to anything, however cruel, was part of their survival.</sentence><sentence id="2363">So in dealing, in communicating with this group of people, one always had to have in one's mind that that was how they survived.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And there was never going to be an easy, immediate communication and trust.</sentence><sentence id="2365">There couldn't be.</sentence><sentence id="2366">Nobody in their life really could be trusted for some time.</sentence><sentence id="2367">So it was very important to find a way to build that trust, and to build a form of communication that took into account their need for their own <span class="INT_SPACE">private space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2368">And this is quite important because I found it very important in working with them that -- for example, I -- I spoke about taking someone's hand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2369">What I found with the young people to be very important was to pi -- allow a space between you and them.</sentence><sentence id="2370">A kind of actual, <span class="INT_SPACE">physical space</span> so that -- and I -- I could never quite put my finger on why, in the early days, that was so important to maintain that <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, but it was.</sentence><sentence id="2371">And I believe that it gave them a sense of their own kind of power base, their own sense of identity and strength.</sentence><sentence id="2372">And I did not invade it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2373">, Side B</sentence><sentence id="2375">9 Beginning Tape Four, Side A</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2376">Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Helen Bamber.</sentence><sentence id="2377">You were talking about the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and your approach -- you were talking about your approach to these young people, and how actually they needed precisely the opposite kind of approach to the people you dealt with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2378">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2379">And a -- a -- this <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> was -- was a recognition, a kind of instinctive recognition.</sentence><sentence id="2380">It wasn't something that I could put down to tuition or guidance from Oskar Friedman, although he was a guidance to me in many of the cases that I had.</sentence><sentence id="2381">But I just -- it was something that I just sensed as very, very important.</sentence><sentence id="2382">Now, my job then was to try and help the young people to be placed in jobs, to begin a life that would be possibly creative, or would certainly give them some sense of solid -- solidity.</sentence><sentence id="2383">However, I have to say at some stage that we were not encouraged to, so to speak, open the lid on the horrors that they had experienced.</sentence><sentence id="2384">And I do feel that there was, in some way, a denial of need here.</sentence><sentence id="2385">I believe that these young people -- and I've said earlier I believe, in the tapes, that people did not have the opportunity, the ability or the resources in time to mourn their dead.</sentence><sentence id="2386">And it's not only to mourn their dead in the sense of their dying, but in the sense of their grotesque manner of dying.</sentence><sentence id="2387">And to mourn the grotesque is more complex, and needs skill.</sentence><sentence id="2388">I don't think that we had thought that through, and even if we did fumble towards an understanding that their inner world was not being addressed, such was the -- the kind of culture of the day, that the idea that -- you see, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> at the end of the war was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> blunted by war, where the message to everyone was to -- to just put the past to rest and let's move forward.</sentence><sentence id="2389">A new world is born, the war is over, let's get on with life.</sentence><sentence id="2390">That was the message of the day.</sentence><sentence id="2391">Soldiers were not encouraged to speak about their inner fears and their nightmares.</sentence><sentence id="2392">They were not encouraged to talk about the horrors of war.</sentence><sentence id="2393">All the war films that came out were really like</sentence><sentence id="2395">0 something out of Peter Pan, they were so -- so banal, and so sentimental.</sentence><sentence id="2396">So sentimental a -- you know, sa -- the war was sentimentalized.</sentence><sentence id="2397">It wasn't portrayed at that stage with all it's horror.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And to bring the horror of the Holocaust out in the open was felt not to be appropriate.</sentence><sentence id="2399">Now, I'm not saying that there wasn't some attention to their inner world.</sentence><sentence id="2400">I believe there was some.</sentence><sentence id="2401">The <span class="BUILDING">Anna Freud clinic</span> was involved in some way in observing the young people.</sentence><sentence id="2402">But I don't believe that we dealt with the need to mourn.</sentence><sentence id="2403">And when I look today at the -- at the older people as they are now, men in their 60's and 70's, women, and I look at their relationships and the next generation, I don't believe that we did as good a job, perhaps, as we could have done.</sentence><sentence id="2404">It's easy to say that in hindsight.</sentence><sentence id="2405">I believe that we did quite a lot of good, and most of the young people have, in social terms, flourished, made good, married, had children.</sentence><sentence id="2406">But if you observe them, and their relationships, and their long -- I don't want to use the word long-suffering, but in their very supportive wives, and you speak to the children, not everything is as good as it looks.</sentence><sentence id="2407">So, I mean, I went about my task of trying to help people, young people t -- into jobs.</sentence><sentence id="2408">I negotiated yet again with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> and most in a -- most unpleasant sometimes, landlords, landladies, and -- and -- and -- and employers.</sentence><sentence id="2409">It was a hard time.</sentence><sentence id="2410">It had been a hard war, and people were tough, and employers were tough.</sentence><sentence id="2411">And the fact that these young people were -- I was just going to say asylum seekers -- were -- as the young people were Holocaust survivors, it did not call for compassion.</sentence><sentence id="2412">Some were good, some were very good.</sentence><sentence id="2413">And many people worked well with the young people, and offered much.</sentence><sentence id="2414">And there was a club, and there were facilities and money was sought for special needs.</sentence><sentence id="2415">But I would have liked to have dealt better with some of the strange things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="2416">I had a young man, for example, who'd been -- who had TB.</sentence><sentence id="2417">And I went every week to see him here, in a <span class="BUILDING">sanatorium</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brentwood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2418">He was a delightful young man from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2419">We spoke together, we talked about his needs.</sentence><sentence id="2420">We</sentence><sentence id="2422">1 talked about all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="2423">But one day when I went there, after many, many months of treatment, and he was doing very well, he wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="2424">And I was quite upset and I asked the nurses what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="2425">And they said he just got up and went.</sentence><sentence id="2426">Now he -- we don't know what happened, and I still to this day don't know exactly what the process was, whether it was long planned, or whether it was a sudden whim, or what, but certainly Oskar Friedman was very enquiring of me as to why I hadn't noticed a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2427">But such was the defense of this young man that he could converse week after week, and I could become quite close, and we could talk about quite intimate things, about sexuality, about the difficulty of being ill, about a possible girlfriend, all these things we could talk about.</sentence><sentence id="2428">But somehow he could, nevertheless, just g-get up and go.</sentence><sentence id="2429">So it's that kind of thing where the defenses have been developed through crisis, through extremis, through the most terrible losses and catastrophes, and genocide.</sentence><sentence id="2430">Where people have built defenses that are no longer so good in every day life, and do not make for absolute intimacy and trust.</sentence><sentence id="2431">And this is what I think happened with this young man.</sentence><sentence id="2432">We ca -- w-we managed to speak about it later, but it happened, and it felt like a failure, and was judged to be a failure.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2581">A: I worked for many years, about eight years on and off with the -- the boy survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2582">Of course, there were girls, we always called them the boys, but there were girls.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And I continue to stay in touch with them.</sentence><sentence id="2584">When I say I continue to work with them, the work finished probably after a -- a few years, I think, after about four years, but I continued to see them, and continued to work with them for a number of years after that.</sentence><sentence id="2585">And I still see them, particularly one or two of them.</sentence><sentence id="2586">But I then went on to do some <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> jobs, social work jobs in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2587">I joined Amnesty in 1961.</sentence><sentence id="2588">And I -- I just do want to say something about why I joined Amnesty, I know it's not relevant, except to do with hatred.</sentence><sentence id="2589">It was very easy to hate one particular <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>, and one particular group of people.</sentence><sentence id="2590">And I'd enjoyed, if I can use that word, or indulged in that hatred for many years, particularly as my husband also had been a s -- a survivor in many ways, and seen his family destroyed in grotesque ways, and I -- at least his -- certainly his father, who was beaten to death in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which they were on the Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="2591">So living with his depression and his misery over the death of his mother, and rest of his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek concentration camp</span>, I certainly nursed my hatred of the Germans for many years.</sentence><sentence id="2592">But it was when I began to realize that torture and other human rights violations were going on in so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the world.</sentence><sentence id="2593">That the French were torturing the Algerians, that other people were torturing.</sentence><sentence id="2594">That you could not put -- you could not put a <span class="DLF">frontier</span> up and say this is where it begins, and this is where it ends.</sentence><sentence id="2595">And I'm not making, and I'm not comparing one genocide, or one cat --</sentence><sentence id="2597">4 catastrophe with another.</sentence><sentence id="2598">The Holocaust will always remain the most terrible of genocides of the 20" century.</sentence><sentence id="2599">But I still feel that we mustn't close our eyes to other terrible disasters, such as we've seen recently, for example, in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2600">So I joined Amnesty [indecipherable] in the spirits, you know, with the idea that I can't nurse this forever.</sentence><sentence id="2601">I have to accept and have to understand that violence and persecution goes on in many different forms, and I needed to understand it better.</sentence><sentence id="2602">My work in <span

testimony and documenting evidence of torture and human rights violations from relatives and survivors who'd come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and in going on missions abroad for Amnesty.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And it was coming out of that -- that work, knowing that we could document, and we could take testimony, and we could supply evidence of human rights violations to organizations and institutions concerned with human rights, including the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, but that we weren't actually treating the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2605">That made me feel we weren't really fulfilling our task.</sentence><sentence id="2606">And as people were beginning to ask us to take care of asylum seekers, refugees and asylum seekers from many different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who look -- resided in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and who'd been tortured and violated in many different ways, and lost sometimes, all their members of their family, that made me feel that we needed to move on.</sentence><sentence id="2607">We established as an independent charity, the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture at the end of 1985.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And we had a vision, and visions are difficult to hold onto.</sentence><sentence id="2609">And the vision was to combine human rights, and the care of the victims.</sentence><sentence id="2610">In other words, to take heed of people's protection, their human rights, to be part of that.</sentence><sentence id="2611">If necessary even to be advocates for that, which is not easy for therapists.</sentence><sentence id="2612">But also to look at the medical, psychological and social needs of the people who came from the -- to the medical foundation.</sentence><sentence id="2613">We've treated over 35,000 people, from over 91 different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, and I have to tell you that my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> every day, my</sentence><sentence id="2615">5 <span class="INT_SPACE">consulting room</span> every day, is filled with horrendous stories of torture, of deliberate mutilation, of hideous rapes, of dreadful executions from all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="2616">And I suppose really, that is the beginning and end, in some ways of my story.</sentence><sentence id="2617">I'm doing what I set out to do.</sentence><sentence id="2618">I know I can't save everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2619">I know that my own skills are limited.</sentence><sentence id="2620">We're an organization with no -- insufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone.</sentence><sentence id="2621">I believe we live in as hostile an environment as -- or at least our survivors do, as they ever did in the 30's.</sentence><sentence id="2622">People are not welcomed, people are deported back to the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which tortured them.</sentence><sentence id="2623"><span class="REGION">European countries</span> are closing the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, we have a fortress Europe.</sentence><sentence id="2624">We don't look for good solutions.</sentence><sentence id="2625">We didn't in the 30's and we don't now.</sentence><sentence id="2626">So really, my work is again about human rights, and the care of the individual, and the individual's family.</sentence><sentence id="2627">And that can be very rewarding work, even if it can also be quite distressing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
