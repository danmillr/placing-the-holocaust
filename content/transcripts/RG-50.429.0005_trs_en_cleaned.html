<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: It is absolutely impossible for anybody who hasn't gone through this what it was like to be among friends one day and the next day you would pass that same friend in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and you wouldn't even say hello to each other because you were not, some you were not allowed to do it.</sentence><sentence id="209">Or some were afraid to do it but you just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on.</sentence><sentence id="210">And for instance, my younger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were his friends.</sentence><sentence id="211">They played together all non Jewish children and they all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up and on his way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because the other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> would not take him and on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they beat him up.</sentence><sentence id="212">And I would walk him to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as often as I could.</sentence><sentence id="213">And they wouldn't beat him up when I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and they would spit at us.</sentence><sentence id="214">And I wouldn't dare to touch those children because if I had touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> the next day.</sentence><sentence id="215">So we really vegetated, there was nothing to do except worrying that, what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="216">My brother was working for a universal pictures and they had a, a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="739">Q: That must have been hurtful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="741">A: Yes, but it, it made me better because I was so full of rage, the madder I got, the better I jumped and the Germans didn't know that of course, otherwise they might have treated me a little better.</sentence><sentence id="742">But I was so, so absolutely enraged about everything, you know, the whole, the whole thing these whole two years that I, the madder I got, the better I did.</sentence><sentence id="743">And that was, that was wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
