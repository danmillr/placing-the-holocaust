<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Tell me a little tiny bit about your childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and I finished, graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which we called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, and after the graduation I enlisted into the School of Foreign Trade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">And in 1938 I was called up to the Polish Army and as a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> I only had to serve one year, and you served in <span class="BUILDING">cadet officers school</span>, reserve cadet officers school, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="9">And I was supposed to be released in October 1939 and as you probably know the war started on September 1, "39 and I took part in the fighting.</sentence><sentence id="10">I was assigned to a unit of antitank artillery and I took part in the defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and on September 27 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> surrendered, and I was taken as a prisoner of war and taken out first, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> on the 28 of September to the west, and near a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prostejov</span> where we were kept, you know, thousands of soldiers in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and meadows and then divided in four groups; south, north, east and west, and since I came from the north I went to the north group, and we were loaded then on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and taken to the north, and we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torun</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> some 40 miles south of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and there we were taken and unloaded and then taken to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistul</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: We came, arrived at the western part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> and the two <span class="DLF">bridges</span> which were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> were both damaged, and we had to walk single file to across the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">And there we were again assembled and we were supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> where they told us that we were only go to stay overnight and the next morning they were going to release us.</sentence><sentence id="13">Of course, I realized that this was a lie, as most of the things they told us, and I, myself, separated myself from -- I asked the guard if I could go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because we were near the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torun</span> and he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="14">I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I didn't return to it.</sentence><sentence id="15">He saw me going away and he said, where are you going?</sentence><sentence id="16">And I said, well, my troops assemble at the other part of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and I have to -- and I think he realized that I was running away but he let me go.</sentence><sentence id="17">So I went to the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and there quite accidently I met my cousin, who never did serve in the Armed Forces, but he was in a uniform, a soldiers uniform and we got together, and somehow he was able to secure some blank forms which were given to people who considered themselves of German origin, and they were issued these passes and he had the blank forms.</sentence><sentence id="18">So we filled them out with our names and signed some fictitious names to it.</sentence><sentence id="19">Of course, we didn't have any stamps.</sentence><sentence id="20">Anyway, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and we arrived around midnight in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and at the <span class="DLF">exit</span> all the passes were checked and there were the SS people and the SR people and the Armed Forces people, and when they</sentence><sentence id="22">looked at our passes they told us to step aside.</sentence><sentence id="23">We stepped aside and then they gathered us.</sentence><sentence id="24">I think there were 11 of us or so and they said, well, again you have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> overnight and then in the morning we going to release you.</sentence><sentence id="25">Of course, we knew better than that.</sentence><sentence id="26">So they marched us from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and my cousin was an owner of a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> and we had to pass near the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span>, and he told the guard -- we were in the last row and he told, he looked, still my name on the -- my firm name, and why do you want me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">citadel</span> for the night if I could sleep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="27">And he said, all right.</sentence><sentence id="28">Go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="29">And then I told him, well, it's my cousin, can I stay with him there too?And he said already, go.</sentence><sentence id="30">And we went and that's how we got away from being prisoner of war and spending the rest of the war.</sentence><sentence id="31">So I stayed overnight and the next morning I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Let's back up.</sentence><sentence id="57">Why do you think he did that?</sentence><sentence id="58">Why do you think he let you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Well, I suppose because first of all we spoke German to him.</sentence><sentence id="63">We both did speak German and we more or less pleaded and -- I don't know who the man was.</sentence><sentence id="64">Maybe he was a local man.</sentence><sentence id="65">Maybe he knew us or at least he knew my cousin.</sentence><sentence id="66">Anyway, it seems that well he had some kind of feeling that he let us go.</sentence><sentence id="67">I don't know and I don't know who he was or what.</sentence><sentence id="68">But anyway, he did let us go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: And one other question was that whole period -- what was it like?</sentence><sentence id="77">Was it very disorganized?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Well no, no, it was not.</sentence><sentence id="81">The Germans were not disorganized.</sentence><sentence id="82">It was very -- the terror was right from the first day, the Germans came, they started terrorizing people.</sentence><sentence id="83">Matter of fact, some of my relatives who belonged to organizations which the German thought were unfriendly to them, they were arrested right on the spot and taken into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and shot on the spot and all trace disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="84">So the terror was there right from the first day of occupation.</sentence><sentence id="85">And why he did this I couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="86">Well, I can go further, and that was when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">It was in October in "39, and I think after three weeks I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="88">Not myself, with some other friends of mine, students.</sentence><sentence id="89">I was arrested by the local Germans who formed special units, protective units.</sentence><sentence id="90">They called -- the German name was and they wore armbands, green armbands and with black lettering saying and they were looking Germans because my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had approximately 10 percent of the German population, and I was arrested just when we were visiting a friend and as we walked out of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and they arrested us, two of them.</sentence><sentence id="91">Matter of fact, I knew one of the German.</sentence><sentence id="92">He was a young man also, attending the yimnasium(ph) in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">There were two .</sentence><sentence id="94">There were two yimnasium(ph), you know <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span>, <span class="BUILDING">German high schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">One was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and the other one was in <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> in <span class="REGION">Silesi</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: I don't know exactly which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but I think it was Bitum(ph) and, so he was, you know, a student at the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and became this and, he arrested us and we were taken to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> as hostages.</sentence><sentence id="97">We were kept in a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">It was only</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="102">straw on the sides of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on which we for the night spread, and we had to lay on this straw.</sentence><sentence id="103">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blankets</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="104">We were allowed, after a few days, we were allowed to contact our parents and our families and they could deliver to us food, because they didn't supply any food.</sentence><sentence id="105">I stayed there for three weeks and only because a friend of mine who knew -- who had a German friend who was associated with some German organization.</sentence><sentence id="106">Matter of fact, he studied journalism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and, after he finished his studies he became a member of the propaganda ministry propaganda ministry, and his parents lived in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he was visiting at the time.</sentence><sentence id="107">And my parents asked him if he could get in touch with this friend of his, whether he can get me released.</sentence><sentence id="108">So they did one night.</sentence><sentence id="109">I think at midnight they called me into a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there was three Germans.</sentence><sentence id="110">There was one in charge of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hostage camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">He was a local veterinarian doctor, German.</sentence><sentence id="112">Then some other person which | didn't know and this friend of his, of my friend whom I knew only from sight.</sentence><sentence id="113">And they interrogated me and, you know, what I was doing and what I intend to do.</sentence><sentence id="114">And I said, well, I don't know, the war -- they said, we're going to release you but under the condition that you have to leave these <span class="REGION">territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">These <span class="REGION">territories</span> which we lived, you know, were the western and <span class="REGION">north territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">We are right away incorporated right in into the German Reich.</sentence><sentence id="117">They considered these <span class="REGION">lands</span> as purely German.</sentence><sentence id="118">So they said you cannot live here.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="119">You have to go to the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which was not incorporated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but which was formed as what they call it, General Government, and government general of this <span class="REGION">territory</span> was Hans Frank(ph) who was later on, you know, at the Nuremberg Trials was convicted, you know, to death and was hung.</sentence><sentence id="120">And the <span class="REGION">territory</span> encompassed both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kokov(ph</span>) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">It was the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they said, you cannot stay here.</sentence><sentence id="122">And then this veterinarian -- I remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="123">It was Grahams(ph) and he said, how long do you need to liquidate your things here?</sentence><sentence id="124">I said, well, three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="125">He said, you're crazy.</sentence><sentence id="126">You don't need three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="127">We want you out of here in a week.</sentence><sentence id="128">So I said, of course, I agreed.</sentence><sentence id="129">I would even go in one day.</sentence><sentence id="130">And so they told me -- they released me.</sentence><sentence id="131">I walked out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and this friend of my friend, his name was Lukow, I forgot his first name, he was a doctor of journalism.</sentence><sentence id="132">Anyway, he walked out with me and he started speaking, and because he spoke Polish and he started speaking to me in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="133">He said, look, it's only, you know, you don't have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="134">You can stay here.</sentence><sentence id="135">This Dr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">Grahams(ph) said you have to but I can tell you you don't have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="137">You can stay here.</sentence><sentence id="138">And so I thanked him very much and I when back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, and the next morning I was supposed to be released and the next morning came and nothing.</sentence><sentence id="139">They called some other names of other people released but not my name.</sentence><sentence id="140">So I went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and told the guard and said that my name was, shows supposed to be called.</sentence><sentence id="141">And he went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and after a while they did call my name and I was released.</sentence><sentence id="142">But while I was there in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> one day they called ten names of ten hostages, and they took -- they were taken away and then they were publicly shot in the <span class="DLF">town square</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">Today there's a monument remembering this, you know, they were innocent people that didn't do anything wrong.</sentence><sentence id="144">I knew some of them.</sentence><sentence id="145">For no reason whatsoever they were shot publicly.</sentence><sentence id="146">And after I was released, I think I didn't even wait a week, and again was my cousin because his property was taken away, you know, the fellow who had the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">It was confiscated and a German owner was put in his <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and he didn't feel secure and we both left and we</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="151">went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">And of course, I didn't have much means, you know, of supporting myself.</sentence><sentence id="153">My cousin being in the business, you know, had some savings and we lived together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> for time being.</sentence><sentence id="154">In the meantime, he was trying to recover his property which he eventually didn't recover but they permitted him to go back, and he could run it because, you know, he knew how to run the business, and apparently the owner or the, what they called troyhander (ph) it means a man of who was, can't find the proper name of it, but anyway, somebody who was taking his, you know, and running the business apparently didn't do a good job, and he was eventually able to get the job back, not as an owner but as a manager, and he went back and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">In the meantime, I did join, you know, the underground movement.</sentence><sentence id="156">It started -- the first organization was called Zydowska Organizacja Bojow</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: ZWZ was the abbreviation, which later became the Home Army.</sentence><sentence id="158">The Army of Kroiova(ph), which was the army which was supported by the legitimate government, which was at that time was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I was arrested on the 31 of October 1940.</sentence><sentence id="159">At that time --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Before you go to that -- how did you find out about the underground movement?</sentence><sentence id="164">Tell me a little bit more about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Well, I had a friend -- a friend who his name was Tobulsky(ph).</sentence><sentence id="168">That's also was one reason why I was arrested, and he was also from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grujand</span> and, he was involved in an organization which was formed by one also a student in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> which he joined.</sentence><sentence id="169">I didn't join because I wasn't there already, and they joined this organization and he wasn't caught, but the principal of the organization was caught, and he was tried and then convicted, you know, and sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="170">And he was executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poz</span> -- which was another quite a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was incorporated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And the executioned at that time was my -- he was -- they chopped you know his head off with an axe.</sentence><sentence id="172">He was axed, and this friend of mine, since he escaped and he came to the General Government to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, was tried in that and he was also sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="173">And he already had connections with the underground and he contacted me and we got together, and he had -- he knew a captain of the Polish Armed Forces, prewar, who was member of the organization, and he swore me in as a member.</sentence><sentence id="174">And I myself, don't think that I was arrested for that because I don't think they knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="175">But they knew that I knew this friend of mine and since he had a sentence, a death sentence hanging over his head.</sentence><sentence id="176">Apparently, they were following him because when they arrested me they came to my -- they arrested me at three o'clock in the morning on October 31, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="177">I was asleep.</sentence><sentence id="178">Thad a small <span class="INT_SPACE">bachelor's apartment</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and in the night, you know, I heard tremendous knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, kicking at <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw three people.</sentence><sentence id="179">And one was in a Gestapo uniform and the other two were in civilian clothes and they were shouting to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> immediately.</sentence><sentence id="180">So I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they pushed me aside.</sentence><sentence id="181">They came with drawn revolvers and they push me aside, and one went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and one went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and the other to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and they were looking around.</sentence><sentence id="182">They were looking for they said leaflets</sentence><sentence id="184">you know and for arms.</sentence><sentence id="185">Well, they didn't find it either because I didn't keep anything at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">Anyway, then they started asking me questions and one question was that your friend was here with you yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="187">And they -- apparently he changed his name and he failed to tell me about it.</sentence><sentence id="188">I knew him only by his new name, and so when they asked me was Tobulksy (ph) you know that was his assumed name, I said no, so they hit me.</sentence><sentence id="189">You know, you can see it here on the movies you know with the hand across there.</sentence><sentence id="190">Hit me right in my <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and I fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and as I fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, they started, the three of them started kicking me and I said -- I remember the only person who visited me was this young Tobulsky and I told them his real name.</sentence><sentence id="191">Apparently, they knew this and they stopped beating me, I got up, and after a while they had a small conference between the three of them and then they came back and said, you better get dressed and you will go with us.</sentence><sentence id="192">So I got dressed and then they took me out, and the two of them held me by the cuffs of my jacket and they walked on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">And this one in the uniform drew his revolver and walked behind me, and he told me, don't try anything because I'm going to shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="194">So they took me down through the <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> waiting, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> -- they only drove <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> -- and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and as they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> I saw another friend of mine sitting there, and he said, oh, you know each other.</sentence><sentence id="195">And I said, yes, I do, and they told me to get in.</sentence><sentence id="196">And one of the SS sat between the two of us and their chauffeur.</sentence><sentence id="197">They drove me to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, <span class="BUILDING">prison Pawiak</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and then approximately, already ten people from other prisoners, and they were registered and then taken -- I was taken to a single <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and there was no -- it was only a small bulb.</sentence><sentence id="198">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">There was no <span class="DLF">window</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="200">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">dirt floor</span>, and the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were dripping with water, and there was only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> which you used as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And when I came there I didn't really know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="202">After a while a guard came and took me out and into the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">I had to undress and my clothes were disinfected and I had to <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">And then after the clothes came back, my suit and so on, was all trampled they took me -- the guard took me to the first -- no, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and took me to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">I don't remember the number of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">Anyway, the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> were small.</sentence><sentence id="207">They were maybe seven feet wide and ten feet long, and there were already nine prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="208">Which means, there were ten of us.</sentence><sentence id="209">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="210">We had to lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">Again, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> whatsoever except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> where we could relieve ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="212">We were only taken in the morning to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> where we could wash a little, and I think in the afternoon once and in the evening, and the rest we had to spend in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">At that time there were Polish guards, you know, prewar Polish guards as were as Germans, SS people, and some of the Polish guards were very friendly and pleasant and helpful.</sentence><sentence id="214">Some were not so helpful.</sentence><sentence id="215">Anyway, one of the guards in my -- I don't know how he found out -- but he found out that I do speak German, and one day he asked me -- apparently he was living in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was Jewish-owned <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and it was requisitioned by the government and the Germans and apparently, whoever took over from the Germans wanted to increase his rent and he asked me, he said, on the salary which they pay me, I won't be able to pay the rent for it.</sentence><sentence id="216">And he asked me if I could write a -- how do you say -- an application to the authorities, you know, whereby they wouldn't increase his rent.</sentence><sentence id="217">So I did.</sentence><sentence id="218">He took me to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I did write the letter, and after a few weeks he got a reply.</sentence><sentence id="219">And they didn't increase -- not</sentence><sentence id="221">only didn't they increase.</sentence><sentence id="222">Matter of fact, they reduced his rent.</sentence><sentence id="223">So he was very appreciative and he said what can I do for you, and of course, I wanted to tell him, let me go free from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, but he said, what I can do for you, I can take you out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">Since you do speak German you can be an interpreter, and he took me to another part of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to another <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> which was served only by German guard.</sentence><sentence id="225">And there I became an interpreter to this German guard, and of course, my life was a little easier because I was with four other prisoners in one <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and we also had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">I didn't have to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And two of the prisoners, who lived also in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, they worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">prison kitchen</span> and as such they were able to -- well, they had more food but they were not allowed -- they couldn't and they were afraid to bring any food, but what they did bring they brought always in the evening to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, whole pot of coffee.</sentence><sentence id="228">And the coffee was so sweet.</sentence><sentence id="229">They probably put pounds of sugar in it.</sentence><sentence id="230">So we drank this coffee, this sweet coffee, which was not real coffee because the Germans, they wouldn't give the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="231">It was such a good coffee.</sentence><sentence id="232">Anyway, it looked like coffee and the sugar of course was very important.</sentence><sentence id="233">So I felt I could move free because they didn't close the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, and whenever the guard needed me to translate.</sentence><sentence id="234">And so I did translate and in the meantime, I was taking for interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="235">You were interrogated in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Gestapo which was in the central part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and you were taken there by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">And the guards were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> as well, as motorcycle guards as well as going behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and when you came to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>, which were now located in the prewar Polish Educational Ministry, and one of the wings was converted.</sentence><sentence id="237">The southern wing was converted into <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> where the prisoners, before they went for interrogation, were taken.</sentence><sentence id="238">There were ten individual <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and four, I believe four, common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and the common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, we -- the prisoners called them <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span> because they were single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> on each side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, and in the middle there was a <span class="DLF">walking path</span> and you had to sit facing the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and you were not allowed to look around or you couldn't talk to you, and the guard was behind you and if he heard you talk or move your head, he came and hit you over the head.</sentence><sentence id="239">And you sat there motionless.</sentence><sentence id="240">You didn't get any food or anything to drink, and they called when the interrogating officer called.</sentence><sentence id="241">A guard came and took you up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">I was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there were this interrogating officer who was now in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="243">When he arrested me, he was one arresting, he was in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="244">He was an officer of the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="245">And there was a typist, a girl and interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="246">Since he knew -- the interrogating officer knew that I spoke German -- he was very rude matter of fact, to the interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="247">He told him get lost, you know, he speaks German, so we don't need you here.</sentence><sentence id="248">And then he started interrogating, questioning.</sentence><sentence id="249">Actually, they didn't have anything, you know, which they could hang on me.</sentence><sentence id="250">They didn't find any leaflet.</sentence><sentence id="251">They didn't find anything and I didn't admit that I was a member of the resistance movement and they didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="252">The only thing they were about was a friend of mine and again, as I told them when they first arrested me.</sentence><sentence id="253">And so it was typed and then the typed report was given to me for reading.</sentence><sentence id="254">I read it through and then I had to sign it.</sentence><sentence id="255">I did sign it.</sentence><sentence id="256">Frankly, it was not incriminating to me at all except that I knew this fellow, and then he called the guard and the guard took me again down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> into this common <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> and I had to sit until all the prisoners were interrogated.</sentence><sentence id="257">Sometimes, the interrogation went deep into the night and sometimes until the next morning of the other prisoners, and you had to sit</sentence><sentence id="259">there until they took you back or they loaded you back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and then they took you to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">So I was taken in the late afternoon back to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">In the meantime, you missed your food.</sentence><sentence id="262">You didn't get any food in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">The food was meager as it was but anyway, I still didn't get anything that day to eat.</sentence><sentence id="264">I can tell you one incident when I was awakened in the middle of the night by a Gestapo man.</sentence><sentence id="265">They came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> and they woke me up, and I had to interpret and they called 20 names out of different <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">And these were hostages and I think some of them knew what the fate which they faced.</sentence><sentence id="267">Most of them were very well educated.</sentence><sentence id="268">Some were professors of the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">Some were engineers and only one, I remember, was a criminal prisoner, and all of them behaved with tremendous dignity.</sentence><sentence id="270">They didn't plead or beg or anything except this criminal prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="271">He fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and begged to the SS man, kissed his boots, you know that, to spare him.</sentence><sentence id="272">Of course, they wouldn't have anything of it.</sentence><sentence id="273">And I had to interpret and they were taken, and they were taken <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and shot as hostages.</sentence><sentence id="274">So thats the one experience I had in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">I spent five months in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="BUILDING">Pawiak prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">During that time I had a girlfriend whom I left who of course, was not arrested -- and somehow she managed to send me a parcel, and how I knew that the parcel was from her because I couldn't communicate.</sentence><sentence id="277">You couldn't write any letters or anything like this.</sentence><sentence id="278">You could only send letters if a guard would take them on the sly, but otherwise there was no, no possibility of communicating.</sentence><sentence id="279">But I know that this what is from my girlfriend because she send me also a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, and I recognized the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> that it was from her, and she sent me some food.</sentence><sentence id="280">But the food was always shared with others and before it came to you it was -- the parcel was very skimpy -- but anyway, it was a sign that somebody did think about you.</sentence><sentence id="281">And as I said, I was five months and on April the 4, 1941, in the afternoon the whole <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> population was called out in into the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and there were already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> set up and the Gestapo people were there with lists and they called the names of different prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="282">And once your name was called you had to go to a different part of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and stand, and my name was called too and I had to go, and those prisoners whose names were not called were then taken back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">The prisoner -- I think the capacity of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was around 800 prisoners but there were approximately over 2000 or even more.</sentence><sentence id="284">And they were preparing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was over a thousand prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="285">So after we -- the prisoners whose names were not called went back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, then they issued us I think -- I don't remember exactly but I think half a loaf of bread -- and we knew that we were going into transport.</sentence><sentence id="286">Of course, we didn't know where but the word already was spreading in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name, Polish name, Oswiecim, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">And everybody dreaded it because the word was that it was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>, and we all prayed that we are not going to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">In the evening the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived.</sentence><sentence id="289">SS with SS guards and also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Warsaw municipal buses</span> arrived, and we were loaded into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">And we were loaded with shouts and with beatings.</sentence><sentence id="291">It was, you know, the SS people with bats, you know, and with bull whips, beating us, and we had to run into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and then taken to the western part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">western railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">There again were on the <span class="DLF">ramp</span>, we were loaded into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">Again, with beatings and shouts, dogs, and I don't remember how many prisoners to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> but there was <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only and again, there was no water.</sentence><sentence id="294">The only</sentence><sentence id="296">thing was a big drum which served as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, and then probably around midnight they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved.</sentence><sentence id="297">Of course, we didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="298">Anyway, the next morning we arrived somewhere at a <span class="DLF">siding</span>, and we heard some voices, shouts, and barking, dogs barking, and then the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened and with shouts we were driven out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">You had to jump out.</sentence><sentence id="300">There was no <span class="DLF">ramp</span>, and we were put into formation in rows of five prisoners and twenty rows to -- .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: Tell me what you remember about the forming of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> and did you see anything when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> got formed, and did you see people get rounded up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Yes, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> was started sometime in 1940 and, you know, prewar there was a Jewish quarters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="446">There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">People could go freely but most of the Jews concentrated you know, in one <span class="REGION">section</span> and it was called the <span class="DLF">Main Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">There was Naleverky(ph).</sentence><sentence id="449">Matter of fact, the <span class="BUILDING">prison Pawiak</span> was right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, I think, I don't know exactly what month, but in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="450">And at that time Jews -- there were orders given that all Jews, you know, had to go and register to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">Now, many Jews didn't.</sentence><sentence id="452">They also were by law had to wear armbands with the Star of David, and I don't think they in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> they didn't wear any Star of David on their jackets, but they had to have an armband with a Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="453">A blue Star of David as far as I remember and now those who didn't wear it, you know, could hide.</sentence><sentence id="454">They just didn't wear it.</sentence><sentence id="455">Now It's true that some of them were betrayed and they went to -- they had to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now there were <span class="DLF">gates</span> and you couldn't go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yourself.</sentence><sentence id="457">Nobody could.</sentence><sentence id="458">I think you had to have a special permit.</sentence><sentence id="459">I never did.</sentence><sentence id="460">And through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, for instance, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trams</span>, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> going through it but they were separated.</sentence><sentence id="461">They were, for instance, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar trucks</span> separated one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the other one, and in order from one <span class="NPIP">part</span> to go to it, there were <span class="DLF">bridges</span> built just provisional <span class="DLF">bridges</span> made out of wood, <span class="DLF">wooden bridges</span> where the Jews could go through one <span class="NPIP">part</span> to another <span class="NPIP">part</span>, and I think they could move around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> freely.</sentence><sentence id="462">So that as much as I remember about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: Tell me about this man doctor, Dr. Eichner(ph)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="484">I lived <span class="BUILDING">inahouse</span> on_<span class="DLF">__ Street</span>, No.</sentence><sentence id="485">13, and this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> belonged to a Jewish owner, and I think if I remember correctly was his name was Volonov(ph) and he ran a lottery in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was confiscated, and there were on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, there were many other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which were all confiscated, and this Dr. Eichner(ph) who was a lawyer lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a friend of mine, a Polish couple.</sentence><sentence id="487">I, myself, think that the owner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was Jewish but he didn't declare himself, and he mostly lived with his parents who lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and he stayed there, but we rented one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">And one day I was in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing there, and a fellow came across, you know, turning his walking stick and accidently hit this <span class="DLF">windowsill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="489">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of Dr. Eichner's <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">It was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">As he twirled, but quite accidently, and he walked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because he was a friend of the lady and, you know, where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="492">So when he walked in, and the doctor came to the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">The</sentence><sentence id="495"><span class="DLF">window</span> was open.</sentence><sentence id="496">It was in the summer, and he saw me standing.</sentence><sentence id="497">He said, what happened here?</sentence><sentence id="498">And he was quite rude, and I told him, and I told him in German that a fellow was walking here, twirling and accidentally hitting his <span class="DLF">windowsill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="499">And so he calmed down, and then another day I was -- I met him in the <span class="DLF">walkway</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he stopped me and he said, tell me how come that you speak German so well.</sentence><sentence id="500">I said, well, I learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I visited --, I also had some relatives in the free state of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span>, which was mostly, you know, where you had to speak German and that's how I learned.</sentence><sentence id="501">And he said, what are you doing?</sentence><sentence id="502">I said, I'm not doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="503">I was a student.</sentence><sentence id="504">The <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="505">The <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="506">You couldn't learn.</sentence><sentence id="507">I said I don't have any.</sentence><sentence id="508">Well, he said, why don't you come to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I'll see what I can do.</sentence><sentence id="509">I said, all right.</sentence><sentence id="510">So in few days I went to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, since the German authorities -- he was a German and he came from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> which was in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>, he tried to speak Polish and he learned.</sentence><sentence id="511">He tried to learn Polish, and when I came to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> he said, the German authorities gave me six <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> on this <span class="DLF">street</span> -- because he lived he had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there and he lived there as well, for administration, and he said, well, my practice doesn't permit me to spend much time on it.</sentence><sentence id="512">He said, somebody has to administer these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">The administration, what it meant to collect the rent and so on.</sentence><sentence id="514">If there were any repairs, to have the repairs done.</sentence><sentence id="515">So I went.</sentence><sentence id="516">I was already a member of the resistance and I didn't want to be accused of collaborating with the Germans or anything.</sentence><sentence id="517">So I went to my organization and I told them that I was offered this job.</sentence><sentence id="518">What do they think?</sentence><sentence id="519">Whether it is okay for me to take?</sentence><sentence id="520">Because I mean I had to live and I didn't have any other means.</sentence><sentence id="521">So they said yes, that is okay.</sentence><sentence id="522">You can administer.</sentence><sentence id="523">So I took the job and I administered these six <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and there was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived there and the next few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">And later on the doctor got in touch with me and he said, you know what, he said, the German authorities want me to take under administration 10,000 houses of Jewish, confiscated Jewish property because most -- well, most, I don't know whether most, but many of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were owned -- <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> were owned by Jews -- and he said they were all confiscated and they had to be administered and he said, what do you think?</sentence><sentence id="525">Shall I under take?</sentence><sentence id="526">And I said, well, I didn't think about him that he couldn't do it, but it would give jobs to many Poles who could do it and have a job and means to live.</sentence><sentence id="527">So I said, yes, why not.</sentence><sentence id="528">He said, do you think I will get these people to -- and I said, I'm sure you will.</sentence><sentence id="529">You will have to advertise and you will get many people to try and help you administer these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, which he did.</sentence><sentence id="530">He did advertise.</sentence><sentence id="531">Matter of fact, my brother-in-law was a lawyer himself but he was in the prisoner of war camp, but some of his friends knew me and met me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="532">And matter of fact, they came to me, whether I couldn't help them get these jobs and they did.</sentence><sentence id="533">They did get, and the 10,000 Jewish property was administered mostly by Pole, and Dr.Eichner had to have a big staff and he employed one lawyer, also a Polish lawyer who had to do all the hiring and all the -- and Dr. Eichner also had a girlfriend who was Polish, and after my arrest -- I left later on -- learned that he was shot.</sentence><sentence id="534">He was executed.</sentence><sentence id="535">Now, there were rumors that the Gestapo, because he was so friendly towards Poles, that he was executed by them.</sentence><sentence id="536">Other version is that he was executed by the resistance because he had, you know, he had Polish

was actually Ukrainian, or he made her Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="549">He gave her a Ukrainian pass, because to be Polish and he associating with Polish girls was not in the best interest of his, and it didn't look very nicely with the German authorities.</sentence><sentence id="550">So he made her Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="551">Actually, her father I think was a white

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: Why don't we begin with -- if you could just give me the date, and the unopening of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and just start at that point and describe to me what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: Well, when they opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> it was now April the 5, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="689">We were driven out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and put in rows of five and twenty rows of five made a hundred prisoners, and the next hundred and so on.</sentence><sentence id="690">And then we were surrounded by the guards and with the dogs and marched.</sentence><sentence id="691">We marched maybe 15, 20 minutes and then we came to a <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="692">Of course, we still didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="693">We came to a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and on top of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> there was a sign which read " ", which means, "Work will make you free".</sentence></p><p><sentence id="694">And on the side later on we found out it was the <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> on the side, there was a sign which read <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Auschwitz</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="695">KL" stands for concentration-slager (ph) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and then of course, we knew we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the place we dreaded most.</sentence><sentence id="696">And they opened the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, we marched in and we were met by some, as I said, sinister looking characters, you know, in navy caps, something like marines, I mean sailors ware and navy blue jackets and stripe trousers with high boots.</sentence><sentence id="697">Later on we found out that this was the German Elderstedt(ph) which means he was camp senior and he was a German criminal prisoner and his name was number one.</sentence><sentence id="698">His name as I mentioned before was Bruno Brounee(ph).</sentence><sentence id="699">He wore a yellow armband with black lettering on which is it says, - ---Elderstedt, and then there was some other, you know, prisoners in striped uniforms with armbands.</sentence><sentence id="700">Some had block elderstedt which means block senior, and we were marched to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="701">There we had to undress and we were shaved all over our bodies including our heads, and then we had to go into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> which was full of some chemicals, disinfectants, we had to submerge in it, and then from there we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and we had to wash, and when we came out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, we had to put our civilian clothes, because when we came from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> we were still in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="702">We had to -- it was packed in a bag, in a paper bag with our number.</sentence><sentence id="703">Of course, we didn't have the number then but after the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> then we were issued prison uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="704">We got long underwear, striped, you know, blue and white stripes but very, very narrow underwear, and then we received striped, one-inch white striped, white and blue trousers and jackets and a cap, also striped.</sentence><sentence id="705">Then we were issued to swatches of white cloth with a number.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="706">My number was 13390 and two red triangles.</sentence><sentence id="707">A red triangle indicated that we were political prisoners, and these, these numbers and the triangles we later on had to sew on our jackets on the left hand side of the jacket, the triangle first, and underneath the number and on the right hand side of the trouser leg.</sentence><sentence id="708">Again, the triangle at the top and the number at the bottom, and the numbers were assigned also to the our civilian clothes which we had to pack in a bag which was then stored in a special <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">And then again, we were put -- I don't know, with a 100 or 50 or what, and we were taken over by a block elderstedt, it means a block senior.</sentence><sentence id="710">And the block senior walked us to the <span class="DLF">block</span> and we were assigned to <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">I remember my block assignment was number seven, and at that time the numbering changed constantly because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in constant construction.</sentence><sentence id="712">You know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was the former <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of a Polish artillery unit, prewar artillery unit, and this sight was chosen, you know, for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="713">And this</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="717">2 block number seven was a one-story <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> and the block elder, his name was -- well, I don't know his name but he was called "Bloody Alloys".</sentence><sentence id="718">His first name was Alloys, "Bloody Alloys".</sentence><sentence id="719">He wore also a red triangle and he came from Sacknow(ph).</sentence><sentence id="720">He was a German apparently, a German Communist but he was the most brutal person one can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="721">To kill for him, a prisoner didn't mean anything and that's why he was called "Bloody Alloys", and we were taken to this <span class="DLF">block</span> and I was assigned to -- there were only four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on this <span class="DLF">block</span> and this huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, I don't know the size, but probably maybe 50 feet by 20 or so, a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and in charge of each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a room elder, and most of them were already Polish prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="722">The block elder were all Germans and I was assigned to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and he was a Polish fellow, I forgot his name, and we had -- there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">There was only in one part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there was a pile of straw and next to it were few blankets and in the night the straw was spread over the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we had to lie there, one next to another in many rows, and we had the blankets one blanket maybe for three prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="724">And in the morning we were -- well, the day started, you know, at dawn to dusk, and even before the dawn we had to get up and we had to run out of the <span class="DLF">block</span> in front of the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">There were small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span>, wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> of water and everybody had to wash in this water.</sentence><sentence id="726">You know, maybe 10, 20 prisoners washed in the same <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="727">You just splashed your -- there was no means of cleaning your teeth or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="728">And then you got in the morning, you got half a liter of some liquid which they called either coffee or te</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: It looked, maybe it had the color of coffee or the color of tea but it was some substitute.</sentence><sentence id="730">That's all you got in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="731">Then you went to work and there were three roll calls at that time I came, three roll calls of the prisoners a day.</sentence><sentence id="732">One was in the morning and one was at noontime and one was in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="733">After the morning tea you went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">Those like myself, when I first came, were assigned of course, to the worst possible jobs.</sentence><sentence id="735">You know, you had to dig for the foundations.</sentence><sentence id="736">I myself had to carry the wheelbarrows full of earth some 300 yards away.</sentence><sentence id="737">And all the work had to be done on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">double</span>, and you had to run with it, and while you were running with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelbarrow</span> you were shouted at and beaten and then you had to come back and get another load.</sentence><sentence id="738">And again, you know, and the foremens they were mostly all Germans at that time and they beat you for no reason whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="739">And of course, doing such exhaustive work, you just couldn't do it you know for long.</sentence><sentence id="740">At one time I was also assigned to a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> where I had to chop wood and saw wood and you were exposed to the elements, whether rain or shine you know, snow or not, you know.</sentence><sentence id="741">You just had to work.</sentence><sentence id="742">Now, at noontime we did get a liter of soup and the soup was watery soup.</sentence><sentence id="743">Mostly, I remember for a long time we had nothing but turnip soup and very seldom did you see a piece of potato and not to mention meat or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="744">And in the evening we received one third of a loaf of bread, dark bread, and we received a small cube of margarine, you know, the size which you get in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="745">We also got a slice maybe a quarter of an inch wide slice of sausage, you know, second quality sausage and a teaspoon of substitute marmalade and also this coffee or tea or whatever they called, and that was our food for the day.</sentence><sentence id="746">I don't know how many calories it was, but it was starvation, rations.</sentence><sentence id="747">And I myself always ate the bread and I never saved it for the morning because many times,</sentence><sentence id="749">3 prisoners who did save, their bread was stolen and then they didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="750">So I ate mine in the evening and didn't leave anything.</sentence><sentence id="751">Never ate any - didn't have any bread in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="752">And now, the punishment, if they caught you stealing other prisoners bread and you were caught, it was a death sentence.</sentence><sentence id="753">You were killed, you know, either the room elder or the block elder told a Kapo because when you went to work, you went under different, you know, the Kapos were in charge of you and they told that this fellow stole bread from another prisoner he was killed.</sentence><sentence id="754">They brought him back from work, you know, dead.</sentence><sentence id="755">That was an unwritten rule in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you never stole from another prisoner because you deprived him of his livelihood.</sentence><sentence id="756">So --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Tell me about the different triangles?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Oh yes, there were six main colors of triangles indicating the different kind of prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="790">As I said the red was the political prisoners and most of the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="791">Then there was a triangle, a red triangle on top of a yellow triangle but reversed so that it formed the Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="792">This was the designation of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="793">There were Jews, you know, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="794">At the beginning there were in small numbers but there were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="795">Then there was a green triangle indicated the criminal prisoner and they were mostly, mostly Germans, and then there was a black triangle which indicated an antisocial element, like in cases of woman and, you know, prostitutes and men, pimps and so on.</sentence><sentence id="796">Then there was a pink triangle which indicated homosexuals.</sentence><sentence id="797">Then there was a lavender color which indicated bible scientists, you know, those who were opposed to war, pacifists and so on, Jehovah witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="798">They were this lavender, purple color.</sentence><sentence id="799">They were most, I would say, decently treated of all the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="800">So this was the main six different colors of triangles.</sentence><sentence id="801">With the Jews it was the Star of David, two triangles, you know, reversed on the yellow.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1394">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1395">The respect was in the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1396">The German guards respected anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1397">Well, respected - they had a certain respect because they saw that anybody was able to survive three months, and say and longer, then he must be a person of strong character and strong will and good physical condition.</sentence><sentence id="1398">So they did they had certain respect.</sentence><sentence id="1399">I would say, yes they did.</sentence><sentence id="1400">And of course, there was among prisoners - when you were an old prisoner you were also trusted.</sentence><sentence id="1401">That if you survived the first few months, that you must be of good character and be able to conduct yourself in a manner.</sentence><sentence id="1402">Now, there were, of course, some prisoners who did survive because of their brutality.</sentence><sentence id="1403">Not only all were German criminal prisoners who were in charge, you know Kapos and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1404">Later on matter of fact, I think when the German war machine was slowing down and they called up some of the German prisoners, the German prisoners were called up to the German Army and they apparently formed some special units.</sentence><sentence id="1405">So the Kapos later on and the block elders became, they were eighter Polish or Czech or - there were also some Jewish in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1406">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> there were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1407">Now, some behaved honorably and some didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1408">There were, like one of the prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I camp who did the injections you know killing, was a Polish prisoner who did this.</sentence><sentence id="1409">His name was Pineschhk [ph].</sentence><sentence id="1410">Everybody knew about it but nobody could do - what happened, he was transferred later on to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then he was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1411">So these were the unwritten rules</sentence><sentence id="1413">2 you know of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1414">That you better behave yourself because eventually somebody will get you.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And there was another prisoner, who is also tried and I told about this Kadook [ph] Report Fuhrer - he was a block elder in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> and later on he became a block leader in the punishment company.</sentence><sentence id="1416">Because there was a company where you went as a punishment and you seldom came out once you went to this <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And he behaved badly and he was arrested in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and tried.</sentence><sentence id="1418">I don't know what the result was, whether he's free now or not.</sentence><sentence id="1419">So there were, you know, there were many prisoners - and there were many informers among the prisoners, and there were not only German informers there were Polish informers.</sentence><sentence id="1420">It was a fight for survival and some did it by honest means and others couldn't care less how they achieved this.</sentence><sentence id="1421">So --, but I would say anybody who survived for a long time was trusted, and that's how, for instance, we could arranged our escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we knew all the prisoners and we trusted them and when they trusted us, and we more or less knew who the informers were.</sentence><sentence id="1422">Once you were that long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you knew whom to avoid and whom not.</sentence><sentence id="1423">Whom you could trust and whom you could speak and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1424">Could I tell you that I contracted typhus?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1460">A: One time - well, typhus was always but there was an epidemic in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1461">There was a great epidemic of typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1462">It was the spotted fever.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I contracted it and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, what they called the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1464">It was so bad that later on, you know, we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and there they were three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1465">There were also three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and they were approximately three feet wide and on them, many times, three prisoners, three sick people had to lie.</sentence><sentence id="1466">And, two this way and one in the legs, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1467">So it was terrible, and I contracted it too and I was for 16 days in high fever.</sentence><sentence id="1468">I never apparently - my constitution was quite good and I didn't lose consciousness, but I didn't eat through the whole 16 days and all I did get was hot water, boiled water to drink.</sentence><sentence id="1469">And then I was for the next three weeks in convalescence, and then I was released one afternoon, but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1470">Maybe I had a friend, doctor whom I knew and the friend doctor, it was Dr. Tyfeld [ph] he - after I got out and was in convalescence, he gave me two injections of glucose.</sentence><sentence id="1471">That's the only medication I did get, to strengthen me.</sentence><sentence id="1472">And then, as I said, one afternoon I was released, and the reason for it I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1473">Maybe the doctor knew something or not.</sentence><sentence id="1474">I was released in the afternoon and I was so happy that I was now out of the - and I tried to run and I didn't realize how weak I was and I couldn't lift my feet, and I fell right on my face.</sentence><sentence id="1475">And then I went on the <span class="DLF">block</span> and the next morning around, I think, six o'clock in the morning or seven o'clock, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and all the patients, whether in convalescence or sick were loaded on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and they were all gassed.</sentence><sentence id="1476">And they were not all Jewish, you know Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1477">There were Christians and Poles, and Czechs, many different nationalities, and they were all dead and all taken and gassed, and I avoided it just by well some 12, 13 hours, you know I avoided being gassed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1510">Q: Sometime around late in 1943, I think it was that you decided, even though escape was impossible, that you would look into that.</sentence><sentence id="1511">Tell me what happened, how it led into that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1514">A: Well, you know, I was thinking about escaping.</sentence><sentence id="1515">As a matter of fact, the first day I was arrested when I was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hall</span>, I already thought then that I just walk out because I did speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1516">I thought maybe I be able to talk myself out and I wanted to go to the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1517">But I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1518">I didn't know enough, you know, how the workings of it were.</sentence><sentence id="1519">But then when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at the beginning, I didn't think it because, you know, you were so hungry and you just couldn't gather your thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="1520">All you were thinking about how to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1521">But later on when I, more or less, became acquainted and I got together with a friend of mine and we were thinking about escaping, and we did have a plan and we did prepare for it.</sentence><sentence id="1522">And of course, the preparations were you had to do it with and had to involve many people and trust many people.</sentence><sentence id="1523">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there were some crafts which couldn't be performed by prisoners because they were specialties things which had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1524">And therefore, they did employ outside people from the Polish workers, and these workers were more or less free to mingle you know with the prisoners and some people did mingle with them and were able to talk and exchange information from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and some of them were even able to send letters to their family from <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1525">Some were caught and if the civilian person was caught, then they were brought to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or they were executed right away.</sentence><sentence id="1526">So they were taking great chances.</sentence><sentence id="1527">But anyway, so we did - one of the fellows made the contact, there were four of us who planned to escape, and we wanted to escape as civilian workers and we did prepare, you know, the passes.</sentence><sentence id="1528">They were of course forged and our photographs were drawings you know and then taken - the photographs by a lens and somebody in a box.</sentence><sentence id="1529">Somebody brought a lens and we made a photograph of this drawings.</sentence><sentence id="1530">Not of us.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Couldn't be done.</sentence><sentence id="1532">And then that's what we put on the passes and then the civilians also brought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, and what they did, they came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1533">It was in not carpentry.</sentence><sentence id="1534">It was in the joiners.</sentence><sentence id="1535">There were small <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they could be hidden you know, in the joiners, and they left them and they brought four because four of us wanted to escape, and they brought four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1536">They also brought four civilian clothes and they also - we were able to prepare toupees, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1537">They were very crudely made.</sentence><sentence id="1538">I don't know who made them, but anyway there were, and then we decided that we going to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1539">At that time when we planned, you know, there was no more collective responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="1540">In other words, nobody would have suffered because of our escape and that's what - we didn't want anybody to be starved to death because we escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1541">We didn't think in those terms.</sentence><sentence id="1542">We thought that if we do, we didn't want anybody to suffer for us.</sentence><sentence id="1543">So when the day came that we escaped, we wanted to go with the other workers and could mingle and go in one group and then show the passes.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And I'm sure the guards wouldn't check each pass separately, you know closely, and when the day and the time to quit, which was the worker had to leave by five o'clock, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1545">It was a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where we changed the clothes, into the civilian, and this one fellow who actually made all the contacts with the civilians because he was in a position</sentence><sentence id="1547">4 to do it, he just didn't show up in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> to change.</sentence><sentence id="1548">So then one of my friends you know changed back into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and went to see what is happening.</sentence><sentence id="1549">And then he came and he was shaking life a leaf and he just couldn't contain himself.</sentence><sentence id="1550">He was mumbling.</sentence><sentence id="1551">He said, I'm sorry I can't make it.</sentence><sentence id="1552">He said, I cannot do it, I just can't take the risk.</sentence><sentence id="1553">So then we had to abandon it.</sentence><sentence id="1554">And we again changed into our prison garb, and now we were afraid about him, whether he is not going to you know to tell on us.</sentence><sentence id="1555">And we had to, well - we could have, if we wanted we could have eliminated him by - because of the lies, we could have infected him with typhus you know and he knew it and if he once he went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, you know, the doctors were all Polish or Jewish and Czechs or what and they were friends of ours, they would have taken care of him.</sentence><sentence id="1556">But he promised us, he cannot do it but he is not going to do any harm to us if we want to go in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="1557">He said to trust him and we did.</sentence><sentence id="1558">We did trust him and we had to change our plans, and then apparently, apparently somebody must have known that we were planning to escape, and then the other group came and they approached us with - we wouldn't go in a different way, and the different way was to acquire SS uniforms and take prisoners out to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1559">And that's how we started planning, and some of the people who were involved had connections.</sentence><sentence id="1560">One of the prisoners had connections with the people, because everywhere I worked were prisoners, everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1561">Only the top authorities were the Germans, but otherwise, the inside organization of it was all, in the prisoners hands.</sentence><sentence id="1562">There were all in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, everything.</sentence><sentence id="1563">The whole evidence, everything, was kept by the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1564">Doctors, you know, everything.</sentence><sentence id="1565">So we decided that we do escape as SS guards and take four prisoners out to work, outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1566">And since my friend and myself spoke quite decent German, we were picked to be the SS people.</sentence><sentence id="1567">And then some of the friends who were involved had friends who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> where they stored the SS uniforms and they were able to smuggle out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span> one pair of trousers and then second pair of trousers, and then one jacket and another one, then a cap, then second cap, then the belt, then second belt, and this was brought in and it was stored, you know, my friends who was supposed to change in the SS uniform with me who had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">He was a carver and a sculptor and he had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span>, and he was not bothered by anybody, by the SS, because he worked for them.</sentence><sentence id="1569">He sculpted things for them for which they sometimes give him some bread and some sausage and, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1570">And they took these things and probably sold it or kept it, sent it to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">So we stored it in his small <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span>, and then when the time came to escape, then we transferred it to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1572">Actually, it was not only a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> but it was all the building materials were stored, in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1573">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bowhov</span> [?]</sentence><sentence id="1574">and in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where the lumber was kept there were three friends of ours and they hid the uniforms there.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And these uniforms, they then put the insignia because we didn't want to go out as just ordinary SS men.</sentence><sentence id="1576">We wanted to go as NCOs in order that we were able to carry sidearms.</sentence><sentence id="1577">Of course, any SS man who was taking out people to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you know, had to be armed.</sentence><sentence id="1578">Not only armed, had to have a special permit, but I'll come back later to it.</sentence><sentence id="1579">The arms of course, was an impossibility for us to obtain, but we again, had friends who worked in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">saddlery</span> that, you know, workshops, and we were able to obtain two holsters for which we then made dummy pistols out of wood.</sentence><sentence id="1580">Now, one of our friends knew somebody in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">saddlery</span> and he approached him with a concocted story that the chief of the carpenters and workshops, who was an SS man by the name of [fred Shiner [ph] had his birthday coming up, and his holster was rather</sentence><sentence id="1582">5 shabby, and whether he wouldn't make a new holster for him.</sentence><sentence id="1583">The fellow said, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1584">Of course, everything was done for a piece of bread or piece of sausage if you could obtain it.</sentence><sentence id="1585">And he said, yes he will do it, but what size is the pistol?</sentence><sentence id="1586">We said, well, we can't ask him to give us the pistol so that you can make the holster we said the normal size, just make one.</sentence><sentence id="1587">So he said Okay, but don't blame me if it doesn't fit.</sentence><sentence id="1588">But of course that was the whole idea, that it wouldn't fit because we needed two.</sentence><sentence id="1589">So no matter what he do it wouldn't be the right size.</sentence><sentence id="1590">So he made this one holster, and we told him no, I'm sorry, it is too small.</sentence><sentence id="1591">Will you make a larger one?</sentence><sentence id="1592">Again, for a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1593">So he made another one and then we had the two holsters, and as I said, for the two holsters, we sculptured and made dummy out of wood, dummy pistols.</sentence><sentence id="1594">The pistol's holsters were open in the back and of course, you could see, you know, whether there were a real pistol or not.</sentence><sentence id="1595">But since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, especially in the winter, was rather damp place - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a damp place, so the SS always wrapped the back of the pistol in a dark cloth, black cloth, you know, piece of cloth so that you couldn't see from the back whether it was a real pistol or not.</sentence><sentence id="1596">So we did the same thing and nobody knew whether there was a real pistol or not.</sentence><sentence id="1597">Then the SS needed a pass to take prisoners out to work and the passes were issued by the issuing SS officer, and they were of different color for different days and again, one of our fellows who were escaping with us knew a fellow prisoner who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">printing office</span> and the printer gave him some blank forms in different colors.</sentence><sentence id="1598">Now, the day we wanted to escape which was, matter of fact, it will be in six days.</sentence><sentence id="1599">It will be the 50" anniversary, on the 28 of September, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="1600">And when we came to issue this blanks - the colors was pale blue - and we looked through our blanks and we didn't have a pale blue.</sentence><sentence id="1601">The nearest to it was pale green and we said well we'll take the pale green.</sentence><sentence id="1602">We take a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1603">So I knew who the issuing officer was and I did it in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Of course, we needed a stamp.</sentence><sentence id="1605">The stamp - again, the sculptor, the carver, he carved it out, the stamp out of a very soft wood and he made a very good facsimile of it, and I tested it on a piece of paper in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on an ink pad and it came a very good facsimile.</sentence><sentence id="1606">So then I did fill out on the 28" I did fill out this pass and I signed, forged the name of the issuing officer who was the SS ?</sentence><sentence id="1607">De Fuhrer, Miller, signed his name, put the stamp, and in order that the stamp wouldn't be recognized, you know, I smudged it a little.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And then the prisoners themselves needed a permit from the workshop SS man and this was no problem because one of the escapees was a clerk in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there, and he had blanks and he issued the blanks that four prisoners, glassers are going to work in this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and he signed this SS man, forged his name.</sentence><sentence id="1609">So we had these two pieces of passes which we needed.</sentence><sentence id="1610">Then we obtained, because if we failed, we obtained some cyanide poison.</sentence><sentence id="1611">We obtained it from the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">camp pharmacy</span>, which again, was run by prisoners, and the prisoners who did run it was named Marion Dolinski [ph] and he was a very nice fellow and he gave us cyanide in the form of powder, which we put, wrapped in pieces of paper and each one of us had it with him.</sentence><sentence id="1612">So then, now, before that we already had contact with the underground, and we had the contact with the underground through a Polish girl who worked as a SS civilian cleaning woman in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the national labor social - NSDRP, I don't know what the - that's the acronym of the German Nazi party - and through her we contacted with the underground and the resistance movement.</sentence><sentence id="1613">And how we did contact her is that again, she was instructed to do some damage, either to the plumbing or to the electricity or something that broke down and that the workers had to come and to correct it.</sentence><sentence id="1614">And of course, whenever we needed</sentence><sentence id="1616">6 something and there was a call, then this fellow who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">workshop office</span> always assigned somebody, either himself to do it with another mechanic to go there or I went there, and he made the contact.</sentence><sentence id="1617">We exchanged the information with the girl and she took it to the - so with her we decided that we escape on the 28 of September 1944 and that - how do you say, the word you know, the recognition?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1728">Q: Password?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1730">A: Password will be a Polish carol, which the fellow who is going to meet us was supposed to whistle.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And the carol, Polish carol name was "" ? "</sentence><sentence id="1732">which means "They came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethlehem</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1733">So then everything was ready for us to go, and since we didn't have the proper color pass we said that we will try to avoid going through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> where the passes would be checked.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And we already surveyed it beforehand, that there to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> to which we had to go to do to put the panes in you know, the panes, the glasspanes in, was there was a shortcut which led under the tower of a guard.</sentence><sentence id="1735">And many workers pass this way many times and they were never stopped.</sentence><sentence id="1736">So we said that we will try to do the same things, and we had a lookout for us, a fellow prisoner, a very good friend of us who was looking at the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and he was supposed to give us the sign you know whether it's okay or not okay.</sentence><sentence id="1737">Anyway, so when the day came and we decided to escape at noontime, it was the time when the SS, most of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> you know, for lunch and there wouldn't be too much of them moving around.</sentence><sentence id="1738">Because we had quite a distance to walk to meet our prisoners, you know, whom we were taking out to work and they were quite a distance away.</sentence><sentence id="1739">So when the day came at noontime, at one o'clock it so happened that the SS man who was in charge of me and the workshops came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and he wanted something urgently done and it took sometime and I was delayed.</sentence><sentence id="1740">Eventually, he did leave and he went to lunch, and then I was able to leave and I went to meet my friend, the other one who was supposed to change into the SS clothes, and we went to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">Because in the meantime, we transferred it to the <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span>, the uniforms, we went there and these people were quite worried that we were late, and they thought matter of fact that we won't show up at all.</sentence><sentence id="1742">But anyway we did come, and we changed into the uniforms you know and they inspected us.</sentence><sentence id="1743">They were supposed to then, after we were successful in escaping, they would burn our prison uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1744">They inspected us and they looked out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> whether the <span class="DLF">air</span> was clear and they told us yes, and we walked out.</sentence><sentence id="1745">And as I said, we had to walk approximately some, almost half a mile and it was dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1746">It was really dangerous because we were afraid that we could meet some SS people who would recognize us.</sentence><sentence id="1747">So it happened that we were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1748">We didn't meet many prisoners who had to salute us the prescribed way and where they had to take off their cap and, you know, look at us, and one of the fellows recognized me because I met him later on, 1945, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and he said that I looked very pale.</sentence><sentence id="1749">Well, anyway so we came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were supposed to meet these prisoners whom we were taking out to work.</sentence><sentence id="1750">We told them to pick up their tools, the glass, and shouted the way the SS shouted at prisoners to pick up, and they picked up the glass and we walked towards the <span

between ourselves we said if he does check out and he finds out we have the wrong passes, we either have to kill him or take him with us and hoping he wouldn't make to much noise.</sentence><sentence

heavy panes off their backs ad the other tools and we dumped it there.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And then we walked on the west side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> going south for some 150 yards and then went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1774">The level of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was very low at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1775">We walked in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river bed</span> for some 150 yards in order to lose the scent for the dogs once the search would start, then cross to the east side of the <span class="DLF">bank</span> and walked along.</sentence><sentence id="1776">As we walked further south there was a couple lying, young couple lying in the <span

somebody is walking or even running behind us and he's trying whistling but no tune comes out.</sentence><sentence id="1777">So we turned around and we then spoke in Polish what are you trying to

came and he brought us three grenades and two real pistols this time.</sentence><sentence id="1788">And then he said we can't go any further until it become dark because some of the <span

dark he took us and he led us through some pass and <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1793">I don't know where.</sentence><sentence id="1794">Anyway, we came to a <span

themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1797">Anyway, we did shed our SS uniforms which they hid because for further use later on, and the prison garb was taken out and burned right away.</sentence><sentence id="1798">And we were given a bowl of soup and glass of Polish vodka, a small glass.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And then the same guide who picked us up came and walked us

said, Leo, tell me where is the front.</sentence><sentence id="2242">So I told him.</sentence><sentence id="2243">I wasn't afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2244">I told him it's here, here.</sentence><sentence id="2245">We went to the map and I said, here.</sentence><sentence id="2246">Oh, it's impossible.</sentence><sentence id="2247">Oh, you crazy.</sentence><sentence

what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2255">So -- but we -- the SS, later on in 1944, they knew that the war -- but of course, they couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2256">They couldn't say, but they knew it was crumbling.</sentence><sentence id="2257">Now, you know, and that the end -- and this particular SS man, his name was .</sentence><sentence id="2258">He came from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> and he spoke some Polish.</sentence><sentence id="2259">These people spoke both Polish and German, and he was the purchaser.</sentence><sentence id="2260">He was going around and apparently, what he said, that he took over a Jewish owned enterprise, you know, in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and he got to, you know, for

sent to his address and he brought the letters to me which were, you know, going without the censor.</sentence><sentence id="2273">And next to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there was an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2274">The</sentence><sentence id="2276">5 partitions were all glass partitions and we could see there were four <span

excellent German, and they could take shorthand in German.</sentence><sentence id="2277">And they were girls from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, from <span

evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="2282">I escaped but they were evacuated later on and they survived, and the Polish girl survived.</sentence><sentence id="2283">And later on she came to <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2399">A: Well, we suspected it but we don't know, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2408">Q: Now, I'm going to go back.</sentence><sentence id="2409">I just want you to, as if we haven't talked before, I want you to tell me a little bit about being the clerk, because we sort of covered that in the context of other stories and I think that was a really important job.</sentence><sentence id="2410">And I want you to tell me a little bit about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2414">A: Well, as I said, the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is, the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the top administration was SS.</sentence><sentence id="2415">The commandant at one was Rudolf Hess, and afterwards they changed and everything was the SS.</sentence><sentence id="2416">The political department was, you know, chief of the political was and -- but in the political department, you know, the clerical work was done by the prisoners and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, the compound itself, all the evidence, all the registration was done, everything was done by prisoners, by prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2417">The roll call, the preparation of the roll call for the evening and the morning was done by prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2418">The SS were only, were taking the prepared things, you know, from the clerks of the different <span class="DLF">blocks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2419">The evidence, they took it and then they went to the Report Fuhrer in the front and they reported everything is okay.</sentence><sentence id="2420">And then this Report Fuhrer in turn went to the camp commandant, all everything is accounted for.</sentence><sentence id="2421">If somebody died in the night, they had to come and be laid out, you know, for the roll call.</sentence><sentence id="2422">Dead or alive you had to be accounted for.</sentence><sentence id="2423">Now, in all the work like, for instance, in the workshops where I was there was only one SS man in charge of the carpentry and one SS man of the whole workshops, all the <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2424">So all the other clerical work had to be done by the prisoners, and the SS relied upon it.</sentence><sentence id="2425">They relied.</sentence><sentence id="2426">I mean of course, it was for us, it was easier because we had an easy job.</sentence><sentence id="2427">We were not exposed to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">elements</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2428">We sat at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2429">We didn't get any more bread.</sentence><sentence id="2430">We didn't get any more.</sentence><sentence id="2431">We didn't have any other privileges.</sentence><sentence id="2432">Once we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we were just again an ordinary prisoner, except that we were already old prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2433">We already knew other prisoners and other prisoners knew us and that was the only advantage that we had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2454">Q: Now, when prisoners got taken out to work the ratio was quite different with the SS, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: The ratio was -- if they went I don't know the name, guards.</sentence><sentence id="2457">You see, let me put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="2458">When we went in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> to work, I mean, to sleep, then the guards surrounding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> were those only on the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span>, right?</sentence><sentence id="2459">And then there was the <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> and all the big chain of commands when we went to work were taken out and taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, you know, they were free.</sentence><sentence id="2460">When we went out in the morning to work, then they, through the big chain of guards around on which <span class="REGION">territories</span>, some prisoners like myself, because I had to go with orders to different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2461">I could move freely but I couldn't go beyond the big chain of guards.</sentence><sentence id="2462">Once you wanted to go beyond this, you had to be accompanied by an SS man.</sentence><sentence id="2463">In other words, you were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> altogether.</sentence><sentence id="2464">The ratio was so, one prisoner, one guard; two prisoners, one guard; but three prisoners, two guards and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2465">And so on it progressed.</sentence><sentence id="2466">The more prisoners the more guards and the ratio was mostly one prisoner for two.</sentence><sentence id="2467">Four prisoners, two guards and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2468">That's how it was.</sentence><sentence id="2469">So -- but with the greater chain you could move freely.</sentence><sentence id="2470">Some prisoners could, some prisoners, but the whole administration relied very</sentence><sentence id="2472">7 much on the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> work.</sentence><sentence id="2473">The Germans couldn't do it without, for instance, the architects and engineers who worked, the doctors.</sentence><sentence id="2474">There was a chief doctor SS doctor and there were chief engineers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2475">But most of the work, you know, the donkey work was done by the prisoners, by the engineers, architects, prisoners and they were Jewish, you know, engineers working and Polish and Czech.</sentence><sentence id="2476">There were no German prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2477">There were some draftsmen, yes, who were German.</sentence><sentence id="2478">There was one Polish prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2479">He was an engineer and apparently, he was so good and he was -- yes, I remember his name was .</sentence><sentence id="2480">He was an engineer, a civil engineer and he was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself, prewar he live there, and he knew the <span class="REGION">territories</span> and he did all the -- how do you say, the draining and so on of turf because it was very damp.</sentence><sentence id="2481">Matter of fact, they appreciated him so much they released him from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2482">They released him and he could work as a civilian engineer.</sentence><sentence id="2483">He had to report every morning, you know, to work but he could live <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but he was -- he had to be committed to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and that's the only one.</sentence><sentence id="2484">And I think another one, a builder and he was also Polish and we was a construction engineer and he built most of the big -- and he was also released, but could work as a civilian and live outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2485">So that's two instance which I remember which took place.</sentence><sentence id="2486">For instance, this fellow , this civil engineer, his brother was also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but of course, he was not released and he was a chemical engineer and they wouldn't let him.</sentence><sentence id="2487">Now, there were -- I started talking about there were actually three big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2488">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz One</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Two</span>, which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz Three</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2489"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monowice</span> was east of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and it was -- there was two big complexes of <span class="BUILDING">synthetic rubber factories</span> and synthetic gas plants, and I remember when these were built, and I think they were not finished until 1943.</sentence><sentence id="2490">And the prisoners who worked there, they had to get up around when it was still dark.</sentence><sentence id="2491">Then they had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running, they loaded them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2492">They didn't come back from work until late when it was dark, many times very dark.</sentence><sentence id="2493">And then they got the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2494">Most of the workers were Jewish and many of them died by the thousands because of the hard labor.</sentence><sentence
