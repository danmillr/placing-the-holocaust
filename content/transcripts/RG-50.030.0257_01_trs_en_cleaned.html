<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Could you describe that a little bit, what you mean by cultural anti-Semitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: Well, that we were not included in the human...you had you had groups uh who who did certain things, uh whether be it in sport or socially, and so I was not invited.</sentence><sentence id="26">I was not invited so it I didn't suffer from that, especially not when I, after my bar mitzvah, I joined the Jewish Youth Movement and which asserted me of my Jewish values and my Jewish heritage because that was also somehow I would say a turn in my life because I became uh active in that group.</sentence><sentence id="27">I was thirteen, fourteen years old, and uh it was a group uh uh which was believing in the uh in in political and ideological terms in a synthesis between uh Germans and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="28">In other words it was a non-Zionist movement.</sentence><sentence id="29">The uh major value of this was that you met the people who had uh were devoted towards this idealism and hoping for a new world, for a better world, and the working that go by working on yourself.</sentence><sentence id="30">That means in educational terms uh we</sentence><sentence id="32">we we uh read.</sentence><sentence id="33">We were at this time influenced I remember by writings of Martin ; , studying the bible, studying our history...uh which as I say it was a very special value, but also uh uh by by trying to uh to make a contribution we did a lot of call it social work, which means taking care of needy uh uh children, especially uh uh children of our age in distress.</sentence><sentence id="34">We worked with them.</sentence><sentence id="35">We we we we invited them.</sentence><sentence id="36">We we tried to help them.</sentence><sentence id="37">We tried to alleviate their problems by just showing that we are there for them and for them, especially for children who came out from broken <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, who had who had uh a brush with the law and so on, so that we considered them as uh as people who had to be saved and this was part of our work between our contribution to try to help them, and uh this was I would say very important because there we established personal friendships, uh girls and boys and and uh we we we we followed the principle of Boy Scouts.</sentence><sentence id="38">We we we discovered <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">We were hiking.</sentence><sentence id="40">We stayed overnight in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and we enjoyed the beauty of of of of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">But at the same time we had very interesting evenings in discussions.</sentence><sentence id="42">People had to be prepared to deliver let us say a lecture about whatever the subject matter was, be it literature, philosophy, or whatever it is and Jewish and German kings or whatnot...general things, and that that was very, very attractive for all of us and and it gave us a certain sense of future responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="43">I would not say leadership but responsibility and therefore whatever...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: We need you to stop... .</sentence><sentence id="67">They're not getting quite the angle they want.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="70">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Linda is asking me to have you personalize what you're saying a little more, how you as an individual experienced what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="72">Uh did you have a good friend in the Movement?</sentence><sentence id="73">What your favorite experience that you recall from those days?</sentence><sentence id="74">Did you have a leadership role, rather than a general, more of a...from your own eyes is what they're looking for, and also uh if you could, more about your family, talk about that.</sentence><sentence id="75">Also I don't think you mentioned the name of the movement, so when the tape starts again, you probably need to TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Would you continue to describe the the youth movement, its name and what you personally got out of it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Well the name us first the called , which is the German-Jewish Youth uh uh Alliance and later called , the Association of Jewish Youth, and and uh what I got out of it was that uh I found people of my age and and my call it mentality and and uh</sentence><sentence id="79">my ideals and we we we uh worked together.</sentence><sentence id="80">We met actually during the week almost twice or three times on evenings.</sentence><sentence id="81">We met over the weekends.</sentence><sentence id="82">We we were hiking uh in the <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> which is beautiful and uh then as I say we uh we were really call it enriching ourselves with with knowledge which which came about by exchanging news, by by putting people to work let us say to to uh uh uh prepare a lecture or whatever it is in whatever the <span class="REGION">area</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="83">At the same time I would not uh uh minimize the influence of my of my parents on on on me.</sentence><sentence id="84">We uh...my father, bless his memory, came from a very traditional <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="85">He had a very basic Jewish education and uh we were uh uh not orthodox but very conservative.</sentence><sentence id="86">Uh uh we observed the holy days certainly uh and uh especially during the holy days we saw the families and and friends and then uh my father and after the war as a veteran became active in the Jewish War Veterans uh uh movement, also doing social work for needy uh veterans and my mother, blessed memory, joined the auxiliaries there and so we all...and my sister certainly was also active, so we were all active in in one kind of Jewish affairs or the other, but there was one day or one evening when all this...when when we assembled around the uh the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">family table</span> and that was Friday evening.</sentence><sentence id="87">Certainly having kiddish (ph) and having the Friday meal and having having the relatives uh who joined us, but mainly after that then people were dropping in for coffee and cake and then then the the events of the week and the events of the day were discussed and I got out a lot from that because first of all it was a wonderful family...family uh uh atmosphere in spite of all the difficulties we had around us because the diff...the economical situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> during the inflation and then at the time of the Depression was not easy, but there was a warmth of a of a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> which which I appreciated very much and | think formed me and and and therefore my my my rightful family and my my love for family, it came from there uh and which was held up in all as I say in all...in spite of all difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="88">My father worked hard to make a living uh but on Friday night as they say in that famous uh uh uh song, Yiddish song, that on Friday night every Jew is a king, and this this was reflected uh in the observance of the rituals and then also in in a social way and uh uh that was known to us so and there there were no invitations sent out.</sentence><sentence id="89">People just dropped in and we were happy to have them and shared with them whatever we had.</sentence><sentence id="90">Uh and uh in the youth movement, not only did we do uh uh intellectual work and educational work but certainly uh they developed ties with with friends and I must say that for for...over the years these ties became very...have remained very close, up to today.</sentence><sentence id="91">They are not too many people left survive, but some of them I I went to together to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I lost them, but uh especially I must say when I came for the first time on a on a visit to this...to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">I was sent by the United Jewish Appeal in 1946 to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to bring the message of the survivors to to to the American Jewry.</sentence><sentence id="93">I met some of my old friends of that time and uh it was interesting that we could...as if nothing had happened in between.</sentence><sentence id="94">These ties were there again in spite of of of distance and and time.</sentence><sentence id="95">We got together again, irrespective of our changed political orientation in many a time or ideological orientation, but this tie...these personal ties were strong ties and have remained uh uh and I would say still today for ourselves, the old guard, we get together whenever we can and and this has remained.</sentence><sentence id="96">I also met my first wife in the youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="97">We were very young</sentence><sentence id="99">and uh and developed a relationship and and later uh uh we got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, so uh it it was uh a time which which somehow formed us in in in a certain way and I would say that my uh devotion to uh to uh, if I may say so, to uh things outside of personal interest, to do something for the community, to do something for...to make it...try to make a contribution uh was...originated from the fact that I saw it in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my parents who had dedicated their their time and life to certain things within these limits of their possibility, and later uh in the youth movement where we were educated in the belief that uh uh it's not enough what you do for yourself.</sentence><sentence id="100">You have to try also to uh to uh to do something for people who who are less lucky than you are or or need your help and and and support.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: And until what age did you stay in the youth movement?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Actually I stayed in the youth move...youth movement as long as it existed, because in 1945 our group was dissolved by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="131">Uh we tried but in in spite...in other words they did not allow us to to continue uh to to operate.</sentence><sentence id="132">Certain other groups were still allowed to operate till 1938.</sentence><sentence id="133">We were not.</sentence><sentence id="134">In 1935 as I say, uh we were liquidated, but irrespective of that uh uh we we uh kept our contacts.</sentence><sentence id="135">In other words, what we did was then that we we decided .</sentence><sentence id="136">Every week we had birthday celebrations.</sentence><sentence id="137">We came to...got together and uh well certainly under the Nazi time things had changed completely with uh our approach to...or our thinking in political and ideological terms changed.</sentence><sentence id="138">Uh there came a time when we came to the conclusion that that there is no future for for for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we should help to prepare young people to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, especially in the years 1940...1935, "36 when slowly but surely uh we we did understand that uh uh uh the Nazi regime was there to stay, that it was not a transitory uh thing, and that uh uh uh uh there was, as I said, no future for for...especially for young people.</sentence><sentence id="139">So uh uh if you want to...I've never left the the the Youth Movement.</sentence><sentence id="140">It it's still in me somehow and uh interesting enough, this is something which...a pheno...phenomenon which is not only restricted to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">When I speak with my friends from the east, uh there was also something that they called the youth movement and it's interesting when you meet the people who are who are came out of that, they have a certain special approach to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and to to life which I share very much with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="156">Can you begin to describe now about Hitler's rise to power and how that affected you and and the Jewish __ in the early "30's?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, uh uh this is a loaded question uh because certainly in the "20's uh uh the Nazi uh uh party became stronger and stronger.</sentence><sentence id="160">There were differences of opinion...would they last, would they not last, but uh given the political weakness of the Weimar Republic which was not uh uh able to enamor itself to the to the people, the fact that the uh democratic parties and the social democrats lost more and more in influence...uh uh we we...in spite of all that we thought that the Republic would do...the Weimar Republic uh representatives would do something to try</sentence><sentence id="162">to stop the movement.</sentence><sentence id="163">They were not able to do it, so you had certainly a...during the Depression you had millions of unemployed and Hitler was uh uh able to...and his henchmen...to capitalize on that and uh in addition to that that certainly there was a nationalistic feeling that uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had not lost the war but was stabbed in the back and therefore the German army was not defeated but was was uh defeated by the so-called <span class="REGION">home-front</span>, which means by social democrats and communists and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="164">Uh since we had our own Jewish values, I would say, it didn't affect us what the Nazi were were were were teaching and preaching, uh but on the other hand we were no doubt concerned what will what will happen in political terms.</sentence><sentence id="165">One consideration was that uh uh if Hitler should try to come to power, the uh the uh powers around <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...<span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>...would never...and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>...would never allow him to do so but this was certainly an illusion as we learned later, and irrespective of that uh I and my friends and my future wife, we tried to uh uh participate as actively as we could still in the cultural life of of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> which was in this respect a wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was leading in the in the area of music, <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, literature, and so on and we tried to uh to uh to uh to uh to participate to the best of our ability.</sentence><sentence id="167">In 1938..."31, I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I entered the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span> to study law and economics and as students we had certain, certain privileges which...not privileges but certain uh when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> or the opera, it was for very cheap money and we we we uh it was then still an accepted fact that we participated fully as Germans in this life, last not least due to the fact that in this cultural life you had many uh leading Jewish personalities.</sentence><sentence id="168">After all, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...it was a city of Einstein, in the field of music of ____ and Otto (ph) and and and so and and say we uh we uh we really uh enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="169">Still we we were concerned about the fact that the uh the uh Nazis uh in a democratic way, uh were able to uh to uh add to their power because when it came to voting they increased their seats in the in the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span>, especially in the years of 1931 and 1932.</sentence><sentence id="170">Uh life at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, for instance, already was also influenced by the...rcemember that, you know, there was there was uh uh a time around eleven o'clock when we all assembled in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, Jewish groups, the the leftists, and so on, democratic groups...sorry, not leftists...democratic groups, but also the Nazis and that didn't take long and uh there were brawls and there was fighting and so and since the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was ex-territorial, uh they didn't allow the police to interfere so it was very unpleasant but the uh classes and also the classes of the Jewish professors, were not actually affected, at least not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">There was cases in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bressler</span> (ph) we know where they where they tried to disturb classes and so on, but not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and uh uh on the other hand uh also amongst the students it was taken up, amongst the intellectuals who originally very much from the conservative groups of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, who had never become uh uh uh engaged in the principles of the Weimar Republic or democratic principles.</sentence><sentence id="172">Uh there was no real rebirth.</sentence><sentence id="173">I mean, democracy uh in after 1918 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did not become a real fundamental political system, and uh especially these these uh nationalistic conserve...conservative groups called , they uh were uh...they produced most of the students.</sentence><sentence id="174">Also due to the fact that uh uh then education became a monopoly of the of the uh more wealthier democracy in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">There was not enough done in order to get people also out of less wealthier groups of</sentence><sentence id="177">the of the of the progressive let us say, so we had our our our difficulties and still uh irrespective we we did our work as students and uh and uh then when Hitler came to power on January 30th, 1933...] remember that day very well.</sentence><sentence id="178">I was a student then and I had taken my classes and then all of a sudden came the news that Hitler had been called in to <span class="BUILDING">office</span> by the German President.</sentence><sentence id="179">Now I want to emphasize that uh this was done in a very democratic way, which means that uh that there was no uprising.</sentence><sentence id="180">I didn't see... remember in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from from the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, I didn't see any soldiers uh walking in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">Just the other way around the Nazis prepared for the tremendous torchlight procession they they they had organized for Hitler on on the evening, and there was no opposition.</sentence><sentence id="182">Uh to emphasize in a very democratic way which means that that uh and this was the shock we had that he had actually succeeded in killing democracy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with a means of democracy.</sentence><sentence id="183">Uh at the beginning in the first couple of days uh uh the uh the uh especially the rowdies and the militants amongst the Nazis, especially the Brown Militia then tried to take revenge against their opponents, but uh I luckily was not affected uh but we heard there was quite a number of cases where they tried to uh to uh to get even with their political opponents, especially social democrats, democrats and so on.</sentence><sentence id="184">And there were a lot of acts of violence and we tried to follow up on it and to report it to the police.</sentence><sentence id="185">In certain cases the police which uh uh uh was not at this time Nazified completely tried to help uh but also they...but slowly this this this uh disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="186">So uh after a certain while uh this uh...these militant acts uh came to an end and the Nazis tried to organize themselves but then uh accepted the power more in in a legal way which means after the the uh burning of the uh and obviously it's my opinion that the Nazis had anactof___--.~ They promulgated very stringent laws taking away the uh the basic rights of people uh and uh then I came to the conclusion that most probably to continue studies at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> for law or of law uh would uh would not guarantee me any future.</sentence><sentence id="187">After April 1st, 1933, certain uh laws were promulgated whereby doctorsand__, uh Jewish doctors, Jewish doctors, lost their license, with the exception of those who had served as veterans in World War I, and since my father was uh uh...had seen action in World War I in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, I was entitled to continue uh with my studies, but as I say I did...came to the conclusion that uh this would not guarantee me a future, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so then in uh in uh April-May I I stopped with my studies and I uh got...I was volunteering in in some kind of Jewish community work because when I was in the youth movement, the work done...especially the social work being done was always connected with the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="188">The Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was aa very well-organized entity and had departments for the care from the cradle to the <span class="DLF">grave</span>, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="189">Uh uh babies" <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">old age homes</span> and so on, and we had a special department also for youth work and we were uh associated with that group.</sentence><sentence id="190">Don't forget the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> uh uh consists of approximately two and one half thousand members.</sentence><sentence id="191">There was a certain tax system under which people paid uh like they paid their income tax, they paid their Jewish taxes, and the Jewish community financed all the activities out of these funds.</sentence><sentence id="192">In addition certainly there was certain private donations.</sentence><sentence id="193">So uh what I did was then I uh I became more active in in in this work, looking for something else but then in 19...and my my my family uh was not personally affected</sentence><sentence id="195">though it was more difficult for my for my father to continue his work as a commissioned agent.</sentence><sentence id="196">On the other hand...and this is so absurd today when you're when you're hear this...uh one of the things Hitler did was to uh to uh establish a a new order.</sentence><sentence id="197">My my father, for instance, had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with his decorations, his Iron Cross which was considered...was...he cherished it very much, so then one of the things Hitler did in "33 was to establish a a special medal for those people who had seen active service at the front, and my father was a beneficiary of that which means that even Jews who had served in World War I also got this decoration, in the name of the Fuhrer, absurd as it may sound today.</sentence><sentence id="198">So uh...and uh since most of the customers my father had were non-Jews, I mean this decoration which you could display in a certain way, helped him so he was still accepted as a as a German, if you want to, because at this time there were no Jewish...special Jewish or something like.</sentence><sentence id="199">That came later.</sentence><sentence id="200">But things uh things uh...and then interesting enough uh somehow by his force...by his...by introduction of certain uh laws alleviating the economical hardships and certainly the rearmament on which <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started, the economy somehow improved, uh believe it or not.</sentence><sentence id="201">And uh things also in this respect became somehow easier for my father and and he didn't bad...do badly, to the same extent that uh you can say that Jewish business did not... mean certain of them closed but Jewish business, <span class="BUILDING">retail stores</span> and so on continued to exist.</sentence><sentence id="202">Depart...<span class="BUILDING">Jewish department stores</span> continued to exist and had a...benefitted from the improvement of that situation and especially when it came to 1936 when we had the Olympic Games in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, then the Nazis for propaganda reasons certainly stayed away from any from any hostile activities and so on.</sentence><sentence id="203">Also because in connection with the political developments, the Nazis uh very gradually uh tightened the screws.</sentence><sentence id="204">In other words, they they didn't start with the Holocaust immediately.</sentence><sentence id="205">It it was that they they started to feel their way around.</sentence><sentence id="206">They had to establish they have power.</sentence><sentence id="207">After they had taken care of all the opponents, the communists and the social democrats, the democrats, then they they they they uh uh felt that they were independently powerful and didn't have to listen to uh to uh any anybody else and in in this this gave them then also uh as we all know unfortunately a power to to stre...to stretch their muscles in in international terms.</sentence><sentence id="208">In other words, the expectation we had that eventually the powers like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so forth

uh we...I wouldn't say we accepted this but on the other hand we also said it doesn't affect us in our Jewish attitude, in our in our...in the judgment what our Jewish values were.</sentence><sentence

and in the youth movement had given me that certainty that that I didn't feel offended by it.</sentence><sentence id="314">What I felt influenced by it, certainly did not develop any inferiority

id="318">Then in the years "37, "38, uh when Hitler felt that his power was growing and that also the uh German army got got stronger, uh and uh the the Nazi Party probably came to the conclusion that

in "38 I remember uh <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span>, retail business and so on were...went more and more into the hands of non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="319">They called it ,

still...he was a strong man and he was able to uh to manage and I decided to to try to do something to offer when I got out, because I knew with studies of law, economics, I couldn't establish a position <span class="NPIP">outside</span> wherever it would be, and uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> again as a place where where where needs were met of the of the Jewish

then we uh we uh in No...in October of 1938, uh my wife's parents had come from the east, came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and as a matter of fact they still spoke

lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> went to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> so she knew both German and Yiddish and in in October 1938 the German government got into a dispute with the Polish government because the Polish government was was not very friendly to Jews, very reactionary and almost anti-Semitic, accepted a law that uh the passports of people living outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had to be renewed, but that the passport of Jews living, for instance, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, would not be renewed which meant that uh those people would loose their their their Polish citizenship and nationality and the Germans uh...and after all, there were thousands of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> still then.</sentence><sentence id="337">We had quite a big well-organized group of Polish Jews, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and and the Germans then came to the conclusion that they will not accept this challenge by the Polish government because then they would be burdened as they thought with stateless Jews which they couldn't deport if they wanted to to especially to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so what they did was that before the uh the laws uh became valid, they uh uh uh rounded up uh Jewish families of Polish origin I might say, all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> just the man...in in in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, full families and deported them to the...deported them to the east into the no-man's land between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and uh this created a terrible situation.</sentence><sentence id="338">And of course in a matter of hours or so that that they they invaded their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in the middle of the night and took people out uh uh and amongst those who were deported were uncles of my wife and uh who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and had made their way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, so we were also personally affected, but there was nothing we could do.</sentence><sentence id="339">Uh the the only thing we could do was again that the Jewish uh community went into action and established interestingly enough call it cooperation of the police

lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> (ph) or this___--_-- what they called it, in in <span class="REGION">east Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">Upper Salasia</span>, and the Poles didn't

class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">Uh so uh but eventually uh uh this was somehow solved.</sentence><sentence id="347">Poles admitted some groups and organized relief action, as I found out later also with the help of young people of the Polish-Jewish youth movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and uh it was so absurd that I remember when we did this work, uh there were transports still rolling towards the east and on the other side of the of the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> came back with Jews who had not been admitted and had been pushed back, but they originated not from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, for instance, so that the problem for the Jewish community was to bring them back at their expense to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because they had nothing to do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and uh amongst these uh uh people who were deported were were were was a couple from <span

something would.</sentence><sentence id="353">Also uh uh shouldn't forget that this November's events came after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, the all...I remember that I think it was September...thought we were somehow on the brink of war in 19...September 1938 under these four, Hitler and Mussolini and and and Chamberlain got together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and hammered out the agreement selling out <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to the Nazis and this also uh somehow gave the Nazis the feeling that now they were very powerful because actually uh Chamberlain had submitted to them and then he was so foolish when he got back to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to to wave this paper saying that in the morning before he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> he had another meeting with Heir Hitler and this is to say the proof that we have peace in our time, so when the November events came, certainly <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> already was in a much stronger political and military situation, and for us uh uh it was the indication definitely that that uh the end of the Nazi regime we had all hoped for, because we had thought that for economical and

the , which we considered the executive and I I belonged to the to the leadership of of this group as long as we could...uh we were able to operate which means up till 1935, and then uh uh uh later as I told you when we were still trying to keep the contacts, it it was in a very informal way.</sentence><sentence id="383">There was no <span class="NPIP">position</span> or special <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">Just I was...1...based on my seniority if you want to.</sentence><sentence id="385">I had .</sentence><sentence id="386">Now to go back to the 9th of November.</sentence><sentence id="387">Uh when it happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, I was deeply concerned like all of us and I had a feeling that something was going to happen, uh something basically that means the Nazis now aware of their power and of their new won role in the world would say well, we don't take this, and they were whipping up their propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="388">The headlines were deeply depressing.</sentence><sentence id="389">But there was nothing we could do.</sentence><sentence id="390">We had just to wait and see where where where where where...somehow where...when and where they would act.</sentence><sentence id="391">On the November 9th, uh I interesting enough, it was a day when I had to be prepared for my final final examination of the welder course and uh then uh in the in the morning when I got out, somebody was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> I met and said Norbert, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> are burning, and I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="392">And then a he...look at these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>...you know, there were still <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>...and I saw that uh that uh they were smashed, that the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were smashed.</sentence><sentence id="393">I didn't hear that during the night, and I couldn't believe this, so uh what I did was I went to my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where I had been married and I saw that the the the the flames were coming out from the <span class="DLF">roof</span>, from the cupola...beautiful edifice, and the fire engines were standing by doing nothing, only protecting the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> next to it that the fire shouldn't extend to them.</sentence><sentence id="394">And I still couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="395">I went to to another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which

see a tremendous amount of destruction.</sentence><sentence id="396">I was standing there and listening to what the Germans had to say.</sentence><sentence id="397">There was glee amongst them.</sentence><sentence id="398">Uh you know, they said now they got there what they deserve and so on, and I asked myself is this the people, uh is this in whose</sentence><sentence id="400">3

possible.</sentence><sentence id="410">What goes into into people to do these things?</sentence><sentence id="411">Uh I had...my my knowledge was...I had read about pogroms in the Middle Ages in in in especially before the Crusaders went to to liberate then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> uh uh but and when the Jewish communities in in in especially along the <span

be.</sentence><sentence id="419">And then the next day more or less we...and I I was going around... mean you could go around freely.</sentence><sentence id="420">There was no

lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">And that was all we knew.</sentence><sentence id="431">Uh so uh a couple of days later uh somehow uh the Nazis thought that it would be right at least to release those people who had been veterans of World War I, and some of them were found walking around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and uh but they were...there was a terrible, terrible appearance because their heads been shaved.</sentence><sentence id="432">Their...the the Nazis whenever you come to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> were delivered into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, the first things they did was shave your hair and their clothing was completely crampled (ph) because it had gone through a so-called disinfection process, so uh...and then one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> had started somehow to operate again, and one of my leaders of the youth movement had immediately uh started to organize some kind of relief for those people who if they had been taken into custody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, they knew where to go, but many of them had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, from <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span>, from <span class="REGION">western Germany</span>...those who had not been taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> had come especially from places like <span class="REGION">west Germany</span> or <span class="REGION">rural districts</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="433">And we organized...and and he organized this kind of relief action and he called me into that, to uh try to pick up these people who came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and you could recognize them immediately, and to bring them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> where they uh first of all were treated medically.</sentence><sentence id="434">Some of them had terrible wounds because of frostbite and so...give them a decent meal, and especially those who had uh come from other...who originated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to establish the first telephone contact with their family.</sentence><sentence id="435">That was part of my work, and that was really...I mean uh call it emotionally rewarding, and I said listen, I have here Mr. so and so.</sentence><sentence id="436">He would like to speak to you.</sentence><sentence id="437">And very often you heard on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> an outcry so so uh this kind of work uh uh became became uh uh took on took on very substantial dimensions because more people then were released, and as I say, I participated in that and to a certain extent also my then wife, because she had also lost her position, and that was nota _, a work from nine to five, and there was...that was not on a salary basis.</sentence><sentence id="438">It was simply...it was just relief work to do what had to be done and also, for instance, to organize that these people could get back...uh had by by by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> to their different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">Uh and one of the things they they asked uh time and again when these people came, and said what what what what do you know about about us, what what does the world say?</sentence><sentence id="440">Tell us.</sentence><sentence id="441">Tell me.</sentence><sentence id="442">What does <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> say about this?</sentence><sentence id="443">And uh I must say this was one of the of the questions uh I...we...none of us, myself couldn't answer.</sentence><sentence id="444">We felt very bad about it, because certainly luckily we had not...I had not been affected.</sentence><sentence id="445">I had avoided the the the the uh the uh this kind of action and uh when they...when these people asked me and said uh fine, you are doing all this work.</sentence><sentence id="446">It's wonderful, but the future is now dark there.</sentence><sentence id="447">I can't... mean I know that that that my business is destroyed or I am not uh entitled to continue in my activities.</sentence><sentence id="448">Uh we were told uh you will be release...you are being released here from the from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> under the condition that you leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as quickly as possible, so what can you tell us?</sentence><sentence id="449">And my answer was unfortunately nothing.</sentence><sentence id="450">Certainly uh for those of us who, you know, to to listen to uh radio Strasburg (ph) in in German or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BBC London</span>, it was was</sentence><sentence id="452">5 prohibited and there were very severe penalties, but still it was being done.</sentence><sentence id="453">So the only thing we we...I could also say from the information I had that there were demonstrations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and a big meeting in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span>, a tremendous amount of words, uh also but no action.</sentence><sentence id="454">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="455">And uh I felt almost lost when when when these questions...and the people were...felt lost.</sentence><sentence id="456">Certainly they were they were happy to uh to uh be out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="457">It was...all of them somehow were under shock, because the treatment they had uh experienced in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was torturous.</sentence><sentence id="458">They told us about the details uh where where in also...I mean I had heard before what what people had been exposed to when they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> or so but but you know, here you heard it for the first time from people that had just come back (cough) about this this this...the amount of violence to which they had been exposed, so...and the beatings and and standing in in in the cold for hours and hours without...or, for instance, just marching without any sense or or or shoveling uh uh sand from one heap to another and then...I mean without any sense.</sentence><sentence id="459">Uh so uh I see in this respect we all felt lost.</sentence><sentence id="460">I felt lost, and uh there was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="461">Even when I discussed it with my wife and my parents, uh there was helplessness, absolute helplessness.</sentence><sentence id="462">And and we we felt lost by the world.</sentence><sentence id="463">Now uh then one evening when I was doing this work, the man who was in charge of that relief operation came to me and said, listen, I have just received a call from the head of the uh central organization of Jews...the name was the of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which means the representative of the rights of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...his name was Otto Hirsch (ph).</sentence><sentence id="464">He also had been taken into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, had just returned and he called me and said uh uh...and he was rather emotional...uh there is something then very new development.</sentence><sentence id="465">Uh believe it or not, the situation of the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, because <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was also affected by the November events, it has been discussed in the <span class="BUILDING">House of Commons</span> and there is some action under the auspices of the former Prime Minister of of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, Baldwin (ph), and Jewish prominent leaders like uh uh Viscount Samuel (ph) and and so they have agreed to uh to uh accommodate ten thousand uh uh oppressed children, Jewish or non-Jewish, but oppressed children so uh uh this is is now to be organized also from here, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh Mr. Hirsch said well, we have terrific social workers who gradually were flocking back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, you know, in order to do work, but they need technical help and this is something you have to do.</sentence><sentence id="466">And I said to him, Martin, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="467">I I'm in the middle of my preparations.</sentence><sentence id="468">I would like to to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as possible because we all are in the same situation uh and and and he said yes, but you know that's part of our education.</sentence><sentence id="469">There's a job to be done and uh uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you would call it ,in other words to do a thing just for the cause and not for the reward.</sentence><sentence id="470">So see...he told me next morning, see uh Otto Hirsch in in in his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and he will tell you all the details, and I came to him.</sentence><sentence id="471">As I say, he was the executive director of all operations, Jewish operations, because we had a centralized uh organization for that.</sentence><sentence id="472">I knew him because he was the father of a friend who was also in our move...youth movement, now living in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and he gave me details, telling me that (clearing throat) uh he just had been advised that this is what the British government has agreed to and to...but no special conditions.</sentence><sentence id="473">The only conditions were children have to be healthy, had to go with the permission of the parents because the parents could not accompany</sentence><sentence id="475">6 them, and uh had...were restricted to the age of twelve to seventeen because this would be considered the age where they could be...could go without the accompaniment of their parents and and and uh wouldn't create special educational problems.</sentence><sentence id="476">So Otto Hirsch told me uh uh kindly help us, because uh our social workers are very devoted and excellent workers but uh unfortunately they have no experience in technical matters.</sentence><sentence id="477">I said but I have never done something like that.</sentence><sentence id="478">Certainly I have participated in the organization of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and and in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="479">He said still uh kindly help us.</sentence><sentence id="480">I said but don't forget I am in the middle of my preparations also to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he said well, uh I can give you my promise that when this will be done and will be successfully done, it will be our commitment and our obligation to help you and your family to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="481">Well, it's a promise to which he couldn't live up because uh in early in 1941, I think, he was uh taken again into custody, was shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and murdered there in cold blood.</sentence><sentence id="482">So what I did then was, I went to this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where there was a department for children, immigration which __ had established before because there was a trickle of children uh who had been given the opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, within the quota.</sentence><sentence id="483">And uh I came to that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and uh when I saw what was going on, I almost died.</sentence><sentence id="484">I...my stomach turned around, which was certainly can be explained only from the situation we were in.</sentence><sentence id="485">Uh there was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">conference room</span> in that uh <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, covered with uh cards, heaps of cards and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> which was covered with papers and the telephone was constantly ringing and I was given to understand...uh there was a lady who was in charge of it.</sentence><sentence id="486">She had before been uh in high service under the Prussian government, a Jewish lady, uh had been assistant to one of the uh social democratic ministers from <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, and uh a trained social worker, and she told me that something has to be done to to organize this properly, and uh after having seen that and having recovered a little bit, the first thing I did was to call in some of my friends, again from the youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="487">We all uh at this time had no...were not gainfully employed in productive work, and all purposes more or less lost our positions and uh the first thing I organized were these cards...these cards were so called...when I asked what is it...these are permits which had come in already from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to give uh children the the permit to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">In other words they didn't need passports and so there were special cards worked out with the cooperation of the <span class="BUILDING">home office</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, with a picture and so...which had come from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then the German police had certified the the the uh the names and the age and so on, and these were cards which which gave the young people of that age a license to enter <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, so the first thing we did...was I did was, with the help of my friends, to organize these cards in alphabetical order and in geographical order in order to have some kind of a of a of an idea what was what, and then it would give me some some <span class="INT_SPACE">working room</span> at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and organized the telephone calls to such extent that, you know, when, for instance, it happened a telephone call came from a from a desperate parent from anywhere and said what's about the application of my of my of my child, and then one of these social workers jumped to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they they they fished out of the of that mound of of paper the the the permit, because they said yes, I remember it had arrived this morning or yesterday morning.</sentence><sentence id="489">And as I said, there there was disorder but not...but not</sentence><sentence id="491">7 because they wanted but things were...had had had had...were were in a rush and and and and had overwhelmed them, so uh then I found out that we...it was...we...it was organized in such a way that people, that parents were advised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and also under the rules and regulations, they had set already with the with the...believe it or not by cooperation with the with the Gestapo, under which the the had to work, that uh uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span>, the the welfare agencies uh and agencies had to select the children, which means that the children...the parents who got a way of assist of this project, made an application to the proper <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and then the social workers, the local social workers, then checked the...if the conditions were right and and then they they made the application.</sentence><sentence id="492">I had nothing to do with that, so what my task was, and I was advised to do that, was to organize the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> so that they could get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">Now also that was not an easy task because we had to live under certain rules and regulations because in order to prepare a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, you had to prepare the proper lists, the records.</sentence><sentence id="494">One copy had to go to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="495">One copy had to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in order to advise the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> that the children were coming and whoever were the prospective foster parents or the the <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> which had to be prepared for these people had to be had to be made ready, and all this was done.</sentence><sentence id="496">Certainly there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faxes</span> and no computer systems and and and when you made...had...the telephones did not uh...there was no push button system.</sentence><sentence id="497">For instance, to make a telephone call to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> could last hours and hours and even within <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was not...you know, it was still in the age of...the the age when most of the work or all the work had to be done manually.</sentence><sentence id="498">So somehow this we got under control and I set up a certain...I can't say I because uh I was then I was made responsible for all technical aspects of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, so that means uh first of all to see to it that the that the lists were properly prepared, that the parents were were advised uh when to when to bring their children to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, especially from eastern or northern uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">middle Germany</span>, because the starting point was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="499">Then I had to uh approach the railway authorities to give us reserved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span>, because they couldn't travel with the other public.</sentence><sentence id="500">Uh then a special <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had to be made available as an assembly point in a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">The local police had to be advised, because uh certainly all this was done under the supervision of the police authorities.</sentence><sentence id="502">Uh then we had...and I...that was also my responsibility to find escorts.</sentence><sentence id="503">Parents could not go with their children, so we had to find escorts to take them, to take these children, so again there was the the human resource...of of the young people of the of the of the members of the youth movement, irrespective as I say, Zionists, non-Zionists, all this disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="504">And we found wonderful people, teachers and and youth leaders and so who who volunteered for that service.</sentence><sentence id="505">Uh and uh at the beginning we were...it was made clear to us that uh these escorts could only escort the uh the youngsters to the <span class="DLF">border</span>, but there was no chance to take them to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">This luckily changed very soon thereafter because we were able to convince the authorities that uh it was in the German interest also to take them up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and they agreed under one condition...that all these escorts uh were to return again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="507">Now at this time uh starting in the summer of 1938, all Jews who who were holding a German passport had stamped...and irrespective of the Nazi laws, we were still considered German nationals...all</sentence><sentence id="509">8 German passports had printed a J into their passports, and when people came back, especially after the November events, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they were taken immediately into custody and shipped into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so in order to protect our escorts, the uh Ministry of the Interior, the Nazi Ministry of the Interior, gave everyone who who was an escort, they call it protection letter which he could use for the border police to say and it said that so and so, in my case Norbert Israel Wolheim, you know that's my name, was was is is traveling in German interests and should be and so uh we had the first transport under those conditions ready in January.</sentence><sentence id="510">And I was instrumental in...that was my first responsibility, and uh together with some friends who were also escorts I uh accompanied this transport to the <span class="DLF">border</span> which was uh Bentheim (ph).</sentence><sentence id="511">It was a German...a <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">I also had to inform not only the people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> but people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, Jewish...the uh the uh relief organizations because they wanted to help the children when they were traveling through uh <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because the technical arrangements were that people...as I said, before came from all kinds...from all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, assembled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">Then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left, went via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> to the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bentheim</span>, uh uh went into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, uh went from to , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> where they boarded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> took these children uh through the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> or via the Channel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where they landed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they had to undergo immigration uh checks and and customs checks and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span>, the Jewish Committee of of uh of London had established their <span class="BUILDING">reception center</span> where then the parents and the uh the uh officials came and and and distributed the children.</sentence><sentence id="514">This first transport uh uh still is very vivid in my memory because when we came to the <span class="DLF">border</span>, uh the SS guards who were uh uh doing custom duties and they were not all of them, or none of them was trained in this respect...they ascended the the the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> and they behaved like vandals.</sentence><sentence id="515">They did not attack the children, but they treated the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>...it was completely vandalized, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">Were tearing it apart looking for jewels and for foreign currency and for things like that.</sentence><sentence id="517">Couldn't find a thing, but at least this is what they did, and any attempt to talk to them and so certainly was in vain.</sentence><sentence id="518">And uh then uh it was so bad that they uh separated the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> with the with the Jewish children from the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and when this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without the children arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, the authorities there were waiting and saw the children were not there.</sentence><sentence id="519">And amongst the people who were serving...I mean who were uh the cause was was were two ladies whose name should be remembered in in gratitude.</sentence><sentence id="520">Both non-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="521">One was uh Ms. Fontaine (ph) and the other Mrs. Weismiller (ph) who even even had dealings with the .</sentence><sentence id="522">Very courageous, wonderful uh lady.</sentence><sentence id="523">She was the uh the uh the wife of a banker, a prominent banker in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, had no children and had devoted all her time to to help especially children, Jewish, non-Jewish, and she all of a sudden came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">She had made her way from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bentheim</span> and uh when she saw and she heard what has happened...uh don't forget, it was before the beginning of the war...she lashed into these SS people.</sentence><sentence id="525">It was...I was so grateful,and__-- one of these SS men, said I have the feeling you don't like us very much and she said well, personally I might but as a group you are impossible.</sentence><sentence id="526">But then, interesting enough, by her interventions she...they they stopped their their vandalism.</sentence><sentence id="527">The two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span></sentence><sentence id="529">9 were then attached to a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which still made in time for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> and we then uh uh were able, as I tried to explain before, to get the permission of the of the Department of the Interior to get passports to take these children to to to to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="530">Now to select these people was a very uh uh uh difficult thing and I felt the responsibility because certainly everybody uh who had a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> certainly looked for a chance, and there were friends or relatives pressing on them and said are you stupid to go back, but this was the condition, and they had...the the Nazis had told us in no uncertain term that if people would not uh obey their order, then these these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would come to an end and this certainly we could not afford.</sentence><sentence id="531">So as I say, I was very, very careful in the selection of those people and thank God with the exception of one case, it worked.</sentence><sentence id="532">Now we had uh uh uh approximately I think twenty, twenty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> uh which left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">Uh it was my duty to see all of them off, and I was uh uh uh every morning when they came together, I was there to to arrange it, so uh uh whether I went with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> or not, that was in a in a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> in in in call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and also part of my duties were to see to it that the children came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in time so that they were pre...and certainly they came with their parents or their relatives and this was then the uh the the moment of their goodbye, so uh there was a problem uh with the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> which...for which I had not been responsible.</sentence><sentence id="534">A smaller group had left in in in December I think, and the parents had accompanied these children to the to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and certainly parents in good faith they try to get the best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">window seats</span> for for their children, and there was a certain turmoil and the police told us in no uncertain terms that if this would be repeated, they would control all the all all these arrangements.</sentence><sentence id="535">We were able to convince them that we will take over, that we will see to it that order should prevail and that they shouldn't interfere, that they could be present if they want to, not__ present fine but they shouldn't interfere.</sentence><sentence id="536">And I think it worked.</sentence><sentence id="537">So uh when in the morning when when when such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was due to to leave, as I say, I was there and uh it was a very, very, very...I remember that very distinctly the atmosphere, you know.</sentence><sentence id="538">It was...there was tension in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="539">There was an atmosphere of expectation.</sentence><sentence id="540">There was concern by the parents.</sentence><sentence id="541">There were...there were kiss...there were tears of laughter and tears of of joy and and the concern and pain and it was a very, very special atmosphere which was difficult to describe.</sentence><sentence id="542">And then when the when the hour of departure came closer, I uh ascended a a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, some kind of a lecture, and told the parents...ladies and gentlemen, the time has arrived to say goodbye, because we are under strict order not to let you accompany your children to the <span class="DLF">platform</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escorts</span> will take over and the baggage handlers had to do their work before to to handle the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span>, but you cannot come and don't...please uh cooperate and don't make our our work more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="544">But this is the time you have to say goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="545">And there were, you know, last kisses and last hugs and and and and...but in general I still admire these people, how courageous they were.</sentence><sentence id="546">Nobody broke down, but also there was the expectation that uh sooner or later they would be reunited again.</sentence><sentence id="547">Very often I asked myself the question later, where did I take the courage to do that you call it 5 where where from?</sentence><sentence id="548">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="549">I was only twenty-five in these days, and I thought uh uh that this is a job to be done in order to help these children and I also I must say that at this time I and nobody else could have thought for a moment that this would for many, for almost ninety</sentence><sentence id="551">0 percent, the last goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="552">Nobody could expect that let us say a year and a half later after these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> had rolled to the west into freedom, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would leave for the east into the into the <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouses</span> of Hitler in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="553">I said nobody could foresee it in the worst of of of your vision, and then uh thus I I say this probably also...yes, gave me the justification to say to these parents and many I talked to to the children who were safe...I said that this is a moment, one of the most important moments in their lives which they still remember vividly, and I was involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="554">But I came to terms with that by saying this is the contribution which which which we had to make and in the long run, at least for these children, it turned out for the good.</sentence><sentence id="555">And uh when we landed in in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, uh we were uh helped...the the Jewish Committee was then the Bloomsbury (ph) House in in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which cooperated with the .</sentence><sentence id="556">It was the central <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the board of Jewish deputies in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and and helped us to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for two days or two...two and a half days.</sentence><sentence id="557">I had...constantly I had uh uh discussions with my counterpart in the in the Committee there to streamline operations, to uh...also there were certain requirements in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which had to be obeyed and there was always...I didn't have too much time in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to see friends or relatives though I tried to manage somehow, and also I had the privilege...the other escorts on their way back had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">I had the privilege to uh to uh to take the...to fly back which at this time was still a big thing, but since I was needed in Ber...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> so badly, I, as I say, I could fly back.</sentence><sentence id="559">We did not see where the children were going because we didn't have the time.</sentence><sentence id="560">Our job had ended the moment we handed them over to the committee at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> and they were then uh uh acquainted with their foster parents or or or the families they took them in or the <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">Only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> I took uh uh from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> up to the north of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">That was the transport of ___, of trainees for for for then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, because uh Lord Balfour (ph), the father of the Balfour decoration, who had no children, had made his <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> in in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span>, near the _ near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span>, available to the Jewish agency and the Jewish agency had used one of his <span class="BUILDING">janitor homes</span> or so to establish a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there where the young people were educated uh for and prepared for for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and uh I think a group of ten or twelve of mainly boys I took to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> because I wanted to see what was going on, but that was the only time when I was really...at this time when I became familiar with the conditions of the children we are taking to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">Certainly later I've seen a lot of literature about these events.</sentence><sentence id="564">I saw the problems, the tremendous problems, and I think this should be made part of of history because uh uh first of all, it is part of the Holocaust history but I would also say it is something which which for which we have to express gratitude to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">After all, when they discussed it and when they promulgated this this project, they were still somehow under the influence of Chamberlain's policy of appeasement and uh nevertheless under the impact of the events in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, especially in November, uh uh they came to the conclusion that we want to do something.</sentence><sentence id="566">They did not uh make uh uh work out charters to see after so many years the children have to go back or they can't stay longer.</sentence><sentence id="567">Nothing of this respect was said.</sentence><sentence id="568">Just <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> wanted to give shelter to these people...to these children to to to uh to save them from oppression and in this respect I am using a word, when I talked about it before, of of the man I admire so much, Winston Churchill, when</sentence><sentence id="570">1 he said that even this was <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>'s finest hour, and should recognize that and I think we...to repeat it we should make it a part of the record even here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> in my opinion, because this belongs to the to the to the successful action and reaction of the rescuers.</sentence><sentence id="571">Uh the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> which left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was prepared uh in the end of August.</sentence><sentence id="572">It was supposed to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> on September Ist.</sentence><sentence id="573">I was supposed to go because there were certain uh problems which had come up and which had to be discussed with our people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">I had my passport.</sentence><sentence id="575">I had my protection letter.</sentence><sentence id="576">I had my ten marks in foreign currency.</sentence><sentence id="577">More we were not allowed to have, but certainly the the the war fever developed into a pitch and uh then we were bombarded from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with a request to try to somehow uh change the date of the departure to an earlier date, and it took tremendous efforts to do it because all the children and all the parents had to be notified and things had to rearrange, so anyhow we were able to to to uh uh to uh have it, to change the departure date from September Ist to August 29, and I decided then uh on account of the situation not to be the leader of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because uh my then wife was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and I and my parents and my sister and I felt responsibility and and I was concerned that if something would happen, especially if a war will come, I will be cut off and I I felt that uh uh I could not have done this toward my family and this is the reason why I was caught in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="578">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> luckily left uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the 29th, had difficulties to uh get through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="579"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> had already mobilized.</sentence><sentence id="580">Uh there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> available at the beginning, but also with the help of our people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the last minute they found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span>, ferrying these children to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and when they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> they they...<span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had already...was already in a state of a blackout, so they came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or I would say on the eve on the war.</sentence><sentence id="581">They...I think they landed on the...on September Ist or 2nd, before <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had declared war but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had already entered...start military operations against <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="582">That was the end of the uh of the project.</sentence><sentence id="583">From <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we had uh been able to get out between six or seven thousand children.</sentence><sentence id="584">Uh <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> also a couple of thousand.</sentence><sentence id="585">As I said before, we we we didn't have any contact with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">We were not allowed to corroborate with them, so that was extra, extra operation and uh then after that, still a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, left for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, for instance, , for training there, but that was all.</sentence><sentence id="587">The the the the children immigration stopped by the beginning of the war and that was the end of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="812">Q: What was the total number of children that you got out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="814">A: I said from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> approximately seven thousand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="816">Q: Do you remember any of the children particularly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="818">A: Uh, no, because uh uh, you know, don't forget these were thousands of children.</sentence><sentence id="819">II remember certain certain uh children.</sentence><sentence id="820">I I remember the grandchildren of Rabbi who who were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> so uh uh but I never met them after the war anymore, but it so happened that not too long ago, uh I addressed a group of children, kinder (ph) they call themselves, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los</span></sentence><sentence id="822">2 Angles and a man with grey hair came to me and said, you must have been my uh leader of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> in February 1939.</sentence><sentence id="823">And I said yes, I do, because that was the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> I took from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and this is true.</sentence><sentence id="824">I certainly didn't recognize him anymore, and uh then at the same evening a lady came to me and said, and you must have been my my leader in April 1939, and I told her it must have been approximately on April 18th or so and she said, yes, but how do you remember, and I said I remember that when I flew back uh it was Hitler's birthday on April 20th, and the Germans had illuminated the the major uh <span class="DLF">avenues</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, so when I flew back and I had that privilege, the pilot would do us a favor to show the spectacle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, seeing this this sea of of of of of light from the <span class="DLF">air</span>, and I think I came back on on April 21st, and and , and by the way uh this was also little little little...it is not revenge but but call it satisfactions I always had when I landed in in in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> at this time was on which was...the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> which was used during the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>...the <span class="DLF">air bridge</span>, and when I landed there and I met the uh the border police and there was a fellow, you know, almost out of a opera with a with a with a like with a big metal shield and all kinds of things put on there, and I showed him my passport and he thought already he had caught one of those who could become his uh customers, and then very very slowly I took my letter out and show it to him and he couldn't quite grasp it and he said one moment please, because he had to go to his superior to verify that this is genuine and so on and then he let me go, to his regret, so that was a certain...call it a certain amount of satisfaction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: Was attempts...were any attempts made to let the children...the parents know that the children had arrived safely?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: Oh yeah, because uh because as...before the war, there was correspondence and some of these children then, and it was one of the first things they did, was that they uh uh asked their foster parents to help them to get the uh the uh the parents out.</sentence><sentence id="837">In certain cases they were successful, but I would say between eighty or ninety percent were not, and then you had the situation that when the war broke out, you could only communicate via the International Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="838">And uh that took a long time, but it worked at the beginning but then starting with the deportations, these letters didn't arrive anymore from from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the children, you know, are quite desperate the events slowly realized that something must have happened, but they became fully aware of the situation only after the end of the war when the truth came out.</sentence><sentence id="839">Uh you might ask me if I have special...special memories of that.</sentence><sentence id="840">Uh there are two stories I like to tell because they are so very interesting and typical.</sentence><sentence id="841">One was uh in the summer of 1939, uh we were advised by the British government through the <span class="BUILDING">House</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> that we should...ought to be careful with the import of merchandise which could be used for commercial use.</sentence><sentence id="842">What does it mean?</sentence><sentence id="843">Since uh you couldn't take out funds from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...we all were restricted to just ten marks...uh certainly parents and other groups which who uh tried to get out, took with them whatever they could...uh jewelry if there was the permission to do it, but also uh expensive cameras and and so on and these cameras or uh music instruments and so had</sentence><sentence id="845">3 found their way into the uh uh <span class="BUILDING">British market</span> and the Chamber of Commerce in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had brought it to the attention of the government that they considered it unfair competition because, you know, when the people came there with no money, they sold it for whatever they could get for it.</sentence><sentence id="846">So uh we advised the parents accordingly and tried and hoped that...so on one of these occasions when I was the transport leader, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> and uh then all of a sudden I heard a a voice, my name, Mr. Wolheim, and there was a customs official and I asked him what's the problem, and my English, thank God, was good enough, I mean my schooling which was good enough to communicate with him...uh what's the problem?</sentence><sentence id="847">He said, sir, we have a problem here because we just found that this this boy or this this lad has has a has a...is carrying a violin.</sentence><sentence id="848">I said what's wrong with a violin?</sentence><sentence id="849">He said, it's not an ordinary violin.</sentence><sentence id="850">It's a very valuable violin.</sentence><sentence id="851">Uh certainly it was not a Stratovarious (ph) or or or , but it was a valuable violin, so I said, sir, but most probably the parents gave this to the boy because he liked music, and uh this was probably his violin before so he took it along, and he took it along because he liked music.</sentence><sentence id="852">I didn't know that the boy was able to play.</sentence><sentence id="853">So he looked at him and he said...then in order to save the situation I said, why don't we let him play something so that you can be...uh see that this is something which actually belongs to him.</sentence><sentence id="854">He said that's a good idea.</sentence><sentence id="855">And that fellow started to play, and you know I was very nervous because I didn't know would it succeed or not, so he started to play and all of a sudden everything around that boy and us became very quiet and I didn't realize at the first moment what had happened, and then I came to to to realize that he had started to play "God Save the King," and because of that, you know, the customs officials couldn't continue to operate, so I started...tried to stop him but he was playing all three stanzas.</sentence><sentence id="856">When he was finished and I felt better and asked, sir, are you now convinced that this boy loves music.</sentence><sentence id="857">He said, oh yes, thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="858">And the other story I like to tell is uh, you know, we were under a very strong regulations to see to it that only children up to the age of seventeen were coming in, and we checked the the uh records carefully and the cards back and forth and we thought everything was fine.</sentence><sentence id="859">On one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> when I was the leader, you know, when when when when you got to uh to uh , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and put...and the children boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span>, we put the children to to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="860">They had certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and so we, the the escorts started to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span> in order to pre...prepare for the next morning because we wanted to be as helpful as possible to the immigration authorities not to have any hitchup.</sentence><sentence id="861">So still working on that and uh we were treated very, very nicely by the crew of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> and that was really, in comparison to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was a wonderful thing.</sentence><sentence id="862">In the middle of that a friend of mine, was an escort, came to me and said, Norbert, we have a problem here.</sentence><sentence id="863">I said what's the problem?</sentence><sentence id="864">He said look at the card.</sentence><sentence id="865">I said what is it.</sentence><sentence id="866">He said that boy is is is is...has passed his seventeenth birthday.</sentence><sentence id="867">He's eighteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="868">I said let me said again, and sure it was true.</sentence><sentence id="869">So I knew we had a problem.</sentence><sentence id="870">I said let me see...let us ask the boy.</sentence><sentence id="871">So they brought the boy out of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and when he came, | almost...I almost fainted because he had just been released from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="872">His hair was shaven and obviously he realized that something was wrong and he was shaking likea____--_-- bone.</sentence><sentence id="873">So we asked him when were you born, and sure enough, he was eighteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="874">So we went into a huddle with the other</sentence><sentence id="876">4 other members of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escorts</span> and there were two opinions.</sentence><sentence id="877">One was to throw ourselves at the mercy of the immigration officer the next morning and say sorry, but that would mean that uh he had to obey his rules and regulations and had eventually had to send him back and if he would have been...if they would send him back that was the end of him because they would take him back into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> immediately, and there was the other group, and I was one of them, who said well, the only thing is effectively is to say it was a mistake made by the German police, and they entered the the date that they made up...that they changed the...the the date they put in was was wrong, but we had to tell the boy that this was it, and made him our ally, so uh he realized that and we said listen, you are not born in this year.</sentence><sentence id="878">You are born one year later.</sentence><sentence id="879">You understand that.</sentence><sentence id="880">He said very well.</sentence><sentence id="881">And we...also one of our friends who was a teacher said you know what we should do it is we should somehow try to program him that even in the middle of the night we should ask him when were you born, so that when the question will come up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that he can...that he will not stutter and and and stumble but will say it.</sentence><sentence id="882">OK.</sentence><sentence id="883">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span>, all tired, dead tired, uh went through the usual process.</sentence><sentence id="884">All of a sudden I hear, Mr.Wolheim, kindly see the immigration officer...END OF TAPE 2 ...what's the problem.</sentence><sentence id="885">He said well uh I cannot admit this young man uh because uh he is eighteen years old and you know very well that uh under the uh rules and regulations adopted he cannot be older than seventeen years.</sentence><sentence id="886">So I said well, ask the boy, and when the boy came, you know, and he was shaking and he sort of...hair was shaven...that officer also | mean somehow uh fainted.</sentence><sentence id="887">Something had to be done, so uh uh uh uh how do you explain this.</sentence><sentence id="888">I said it must have been a mistake by the German police.</sentence><sentence id="889">He said but the German police is well known and almost infamous for their accuracy.</sentence><sentence id="890">I said yes, but today under the Nazi regime, they brought in a lot of people who came in just for the party affiliation and not for the efficiency and and bureaucratic work.</sentence><sentence id="891">He said is that so.</sentence><sentence id="892">I said definitely.</sentence><sentence id="893">So he again looked at the card, he looked at this boy and there was a moment of silence and and and really I felt...I felt...1 mean this was the moment where we...a decision had to be made about the life of a human being and then he said to me, sir, could you guarantee that this is a mistake of the German police, and I said by all means.</sentence><sentence id="894">Now he knew that I was lying and I knew that he knew that I was lying, but then he took a stand, admitted to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span>, because he knew that if not, something terrible could have happened to him, so this uh...he saved his life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: We need to stop right here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="962">A: Well, the second story I would like to tell because it had a very interesting, human aspect is uh under the rules and regulations, uh we were not allowed to bring in children over the</sentence><sentence id="964">5 age of uh seventeen and uh therefore we we not only prepared the uh papers and the lists, we checked carefully everything so that we shouldn't have any problems coming to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="965">On one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> uh when I was the leader of that group uh uh we had a problem because uh usually we uh when we landed in in...when we got to uh , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, we put the children into their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> then took us from , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> which was a trip of approximately six hours, sometimes a very rough crossing of the Channel, but for us, for the escorts, uh there was no time to relax because we had to prepare our lists and our papers for the next morning for the landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in order to make it easy for the immigration, to help them.</sentence><sentence id="966">So we were sitting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span> uh doing this kind of work, treated nicely by the crew of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> to tea and cookies uh and all of a sudden a friend of mine approached me and said uh uh...who was also an escort...said there is a problem.</sentence><sentence id="967">I said what's the problem.</sentence><sentence id="968">He said this boy here has passed his seventeenth birthday.</sentence><sentence id="969">He is definitely eighteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="970">I said I can't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="971">He said look at this.</sentence><sentence id="972">So I looked at this and sure enough, found out and had confirmed that he had completed his seventeenth birthday, so the question was how to handle the situation, and there were two opinions.</sentence><sentence id="973">One was to throw ourselves at the mercy of the immigration officer and tell him that there was a mistake, an honest mistake, and appeal to his uh uh sense of fairness, if you want, which certainly uh could endanger the boy because uh he could say no, I am not allowed uh to to admit him.</sentence><sentence id="974">But first I said, let us see the boy who it is.</sentence><sentence id="975">Uh we asked the boy to come down from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, and when I saw him I almost fainted because it turned out that he had just been released from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">His head was shaven and he was shaking uh because he realized that something was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="977">We asked him how old are you and sure enough, the uh date reflected on this card was correct.</sentence><sentence id="978">He was already eighteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="979">So as I told you, for in this deliberation what to do, the group uh...the one group uh thought we should we should inform and stick with the date and and let it pass, hoping that the immigration would have mercy on us, and the other group, and I belonged to them, thought it would be easier to say that the Germans had made a mistake when then entered the birth date, but also tell the boy that he has to lie in his own interest, and the boy understood this very well.</sentence><sentence id="980">So we told him that that was...the majority then came to the conclusion they uh try to convince immigration of a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="981">And one of our escorts, a teacher, said well, we have to try to program this boy, even during the night have to wake him up to tell that he has to confirm that he is one year younger than the paper says.</sentence><sentence id="982">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harwich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="983">Didn't take long.</sentence><sentence id="984">Uh I was called...Mr. Wolheim to <span class="BUILDING">immigration office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">I want to see you.</sentence><sentence id="986">What's the problem?</sentence><sentence id="987">He said sir, we have a problem, the immigration officer said, because uh I cannot admit this this lad, he said, because he is over seventeen years.</sentence><sentence id="988">I said I I can't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="989">I said ask him, so that boy came, shaking, pale, but when the immigration officer saw him with his shaven head, somehow happened to him...I could feel, I could see it...so he asked me what is your explanation here.</sentence><sentence id="990">I said uh the police made a mistake and he said well, the German police is not known for easily making mistakes, and my reaction was to tell, well the police is not

and I'm</sentence><sentence id="993">6 fully convinced that is so what the boy said, that he is seventeen years old, so he looked at me and he looked at the boy for quite some time and I...it was minutes uh uh just sounded like eternity and then he turned to me and said sir, can you guarantee the fact that the German police has a mis...has made a mistake, and immediately I answered yes sir.</sentence><sentence id="994">I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="995">So he knew that I was lying, and I knew that he knew that I was lying.</sentence><sentence id="996">He looked again at the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: Can you tell us now what happened to you when the war broke out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1038">A: Well, when the war broke out we uh we uh uh...when I say we I mean it means also myself...lived with the expectation that they might do something, the Nazis, take us into to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> __, being afraid that uh we might endanger the German war efforts, who knows.</sentence><sentence id="1039">All kind of crazy things were possible, but but nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="1040">I continued my work uh for the uh <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, for the <span class="BUILDING">Central Jewish Office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, for a certain while.</sentence><sentence id="1041">We had still a couple of small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, to the __ center, but this fizzled out soon, and then I was asked to take over the administration of the vocational training uh <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, uh the the...this organization uh had set up, especially outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...carpentry, plumbing, metal work and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1042">These were very good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> uh uh and let...by Jewish and non-Jewish teachers.</sentence><sentence id="1043">Helped very much uh children to acquire vocational training, and so I also had to travel to a certain extent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which was not easy at this time but I still...it was it was possible.</sentence><sentence id="1044">And uh then uh uh in in the summer of "41, uh in the course of the uh events and especially uh after uh uh...after uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was successful in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and in in in <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, and had taken over all these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and occupied them, uh there started what we called the the final solution also in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and uh then I came to the conclusion that uh it's better to stay away from work in the <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> because there was nothing we could do any more for our for our Jewish people, and I had the the feeling and I want to be careful in this respect, that we more or less uh would be in the danger to be more helpers to the Nazis than than to do what what was necessary to do in the Jewish interest, though I realized fully that all these leaders, devoted men, most of them had become martyrs, tried to do their best to save Jewish lives, but uh uh there was nothing anymore to be done, so I decided to to become separated from the work for the for the rest... call them...of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I uh uh had to uh report to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> which distributes uh distributed uh Jewish workers in in...for forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="1045">In other words, the uh Jews who had lost their jobs and who could not work any more in in in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and so they were drawn into all kinds of work, digging work, transport work, uh uh factory work, whatever it was, because also on account of the uh disappearing manpower of of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they needed us for this.</sentence><sentence id="1046">That's what we thought.</sentence><sentence id="1047">So uh I was uh uh...I reported that I was a welder, so I was uh then uh sent to a <span class="BUILDING">firm</span>, to a <span class="BUILDING">German firm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> uh which had a Jewish group which means at this time uh Jews could not work as individuals.</sentence><sentence id="1048">Jews could only work in groups and the people who had taken on these groups had to provide special facilities, special <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> and so, so that Jews and non-Jews didn't mix.</sentence><sentence id="1049">And uh this group I I joined certainly not voluntarily but</sentence><sentence id="1051">7 but uh the special problem was that this was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which was located in the eastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, uh the northeastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1052">I was living at this time on the west and it was a long way to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I had to get up between four thirty and five o'clock in the morning in order to make it on time.</sentence><sentence id="1053">Uh this was also the time when the first uh air raids started of the British air uh air force against <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, so uh during the so-called alarms, when I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we were...had to take shelter in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1054">Jews were separated there also from from non-Jews and later we realized that these <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> certainly didn't give any kind of protection, but this is actually what was done.</sentence><sentence id="1055">But also in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, uh Jews were were pressed into service uh for for as...not air raid wardens but uh uh uh a group to uh to uh fight fires or whatever it is if something should happen, so that uh very often I didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh uh for for almost two days, didn't know what was going on at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1056">Uh in in in November "39, by the way, uh my wife and I had our child...a boy was was born and uh since we had not uh...yeah...I forgot to tell that certainly at the beginning of the war, Jews were not allowed anymore to have a telephone or have radio, so I was not...was not was not able to communicate with them, so uh so uh uh that means very often, especially after an air raid and if it was a heavy air raid, I didn't know what happened to my family and my family didn't know what happened to me, and uh then in the summer of "41, there started what we called the final solution.</sentence><sentence id="1057">Uh we...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> the head of the Jewish community was called to the Gestapo and he was told that (clearing throat)...excuse me...that for a thousand people uh <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> should be made available uh and uh the uh the people should uh should assemble in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh and not be accommodated at another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1058">Now I think I overlooked one thing, that uh also in September "41 there started...laws were promulgated to force Jews to wear a yellow badge, and from this time on...that was September "41.</sentence><sentence id="1059">By the way, it was also the time when no immigration was possible from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Even during the war in the first part, there was still certain possibilities to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> or later after the campaign in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, via <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through , but in September "41 this this was over and uh what I'm also sorry I forgot to say that we tried very hard but the German...the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> uh with which I was registered uh asked us very late to uh to uh to uh get our papers, our affidavits, but that was not easy to get in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and also the the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> stopped very early to process applications.</sentence><sentence id="1061">It also set conditions which were impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1062">More can be read about this in the book of David about the abandonment of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1063">The American bureaucracy at this time was not very helpful to save people it could have saved.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Now uh in connection with the with the promulgation of the laws about the about the yellow badge, there uh other restrictions started.</sentence><sentence id="1065">We were not allowed anymore to uh to use certain <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1066">We were not allowed to uh to uh to buy and to go shopping, only at certain hours.</sentence><sentence id="1067">We certainly...we couldn't see a movie or our <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and uh uh any...we were were also...we had to to place the Star of David at the outside of our of our <span class="DLF">doors</span> in the in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1068">So life became became became more and more uh difficult, almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1069">We still tried to uh get to...I, for instance, saw friends if possible and we uh we uh...and my parents lived in the easter part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and we, as I said before, in the <span class="REGION">western part</span> and certainly my parents were very much interested and also the parents of my wife, to see our boy but uh</sentence><sentence id="1071">8 when we were not allowed to uh to uh use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">public transportation</span>, we even walked that way which was two and a half or three hours.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Now at the beginning we did it.</sentence><sentence id="1073">Later we did it under the protection of darkness which was dangerous, uh uh hiding the Star and then at least to give our parents to see to see us and and the boy (clearing throat) because uh uh communications over the telephone and so didn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="1074">Uh in in the course of of of that time, the restrictions became became became became more uh rigid and also then uh to come back to that order to the heads of the Jewish community, not to make room for the people who had to uh make their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> available, to provide them with other shelter...there started the first deportations to the east.</sentence><sentence id="1075">Uh we were not fully aware what...and I I uh uh uh tried to get information wherever I could, but uh don't forget that at this time you had no public press anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1076">Uh uh the press was completely controlled.</sentence><sentence id="1077">There were no letters to the editor or free speech or free writing and so and certainly the press did not report about anything like that so it were mostly rumors you had follow in in order to find out what was going on, but the deportations started first with the with the deportations of elderly people who were not uh in the in the...part of the forced labor program, because they considered them as uh as disposable and so transports went to first to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, or what they called, what they called, the Germans, and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>, and some of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, as we know from from from information later, never arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1078">I uh uh uh...it's difficult to say how did I react.</sentence><sentence id="1079">I know we were exposed to a development over which we had no control.</sentence><sentence id="1080">I realized that uh all my attempts to save myself and my family, or to save my family and myself had been in vain and, therefore, we we had to take whatever, whatever...I can...only had to hope that uh the military operations would result in a defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that only in the course of that defeat we could hope to be free again, so that means all our...it was my thinking about survival was to see that that uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was defeated.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Uh certainly there were, especially at the beginning, uh many of our friends and somehow we still tried to meet and exchange uh information about the military situation and so we were convinced that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was invincible, and there was not only of...then when you read today the the reports which came out from the father of of Joe Kennedy, he also thought more or less that uh uh uh the <span class="REGION">western world</span> is...and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is defeated and that uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will be will be victorious.</sentence><sentence id="1082">Uh but we uh...I pers....personally must say uh I was a great believer in in in whatever Churchill said.</sentence><sentence id="1083">Not whatever, but but his way of of telling the the people, you know, we will we will never surrender.</sentence><sentence id="1084">We will fight at the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1085">We will fight wherever we...we will never surrender.</sentence><sentence id="1086">This gave me hope.</sentence><sentence id="1087">Also my expectation that one day uh public opinion in in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, which was rather isolationist, might change and become aware that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is not only a danger for Europe but also for for for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the long run, so uh and also that that especially after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, that there was a certain parallel for anybody who knew history, that when Napoleon tried to uh to uh to fight <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, that was end of his of his Empire, so I I was convinced that uh in spite of all the the military might <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had developed, that uh uh it could not last.</sentence><sentence id="1088">The question only was how long?</sentence><sentence id="1089">And in this respect also I...how did did I know.</sentence><sentence id="1090">We were cut off from the world.</sentence><sentence id="1091">We we couldn't see uh uh any any news objectively.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Whatever we saw in the headlines...and by the way we were not even allowed</sentence><sentence id="1094">9 to to buy a paper.</sentence><sentence id="1095">A neighbor of mine brought me a paper once in a while, but that was all regulated and uh only the suc...the success was reported but defeat were not.</sentence><sentence id="1096">But uh then when I was in in this in this labor gang, if I may call it, and uh the attacks by the air force became stronger after Hitler had proclaimed and___ had proclaimed already that the British were defeated.</sentence><sentence id="1097">It gave me no hope, and my wife also the same way, that in the long run uh uh uh there must come a turn, and uh then uh especially when when when the military uh events uh changed the whole situation by the defeat of Rommel in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and especially after the defeat of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1098">Uh this gave me a tremendous hope and gave all of us a tremendous hope, but this was a time already when one transport after the other left, for instance, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and the question was how long will it...when when when will when will the sword come down on us.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Uh I had uh uh in this labor gang in which...where we were working, there was one member, a Jewish fellow who worked with us, who was uh what we called a privileged Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1100">That means he didn't have to carry the the yellow badge, the Star of David, because he was married to a non-Jewess and their children were educated as as uh Christians, so he had still the right to uh to keep a radio, and with him we could arrange...I say with him, with some friends in that labor gang, that during the night he should get up and certainly that was something which was uh...the threat of death penalty if he would be caught...to listen to BBC London and and and to the German service to find out what the situation was.</sentence><sentence id="1101">He did it under the condition that we would provide him in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> with with coffee because he said when he had to get up during the night and he couldn't find sleep immediately, in the morning he was dead tired so he needs real coffee in order to survive the day.</sentence><sentence id="1102">This we could do.</sentence><sentence id="1103">And I I...I said I was one of them who was instrumental in this, so every morning when we came, he whispered to us what he had heard during the night, and in this respect uh we, or I was fully familiar with the progress of uh the Russian army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and of the other defeat of the 6th German army under __in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and especially when when when it came to an end with the with the loss of approximately three hundred thousand German soldiers, so the question came, how long will they be able?</sentence><sentence id="1104">Would that mean the end of it and how fast would would the end came.</sentence><sentence id="1105">Uh but uh uh on the other hand, uh the the the Nazis, in spite of of uh these military developments, continued with their deportations.</sentence><sentence id="1106">In December 1942, my parents were deported.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Uh I was...on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I tried to to see them.</sentence><sentence id="1108">Then I was told that uh uh the Gestapo had come, had taken them on short notice.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Uh later I found out that they were in a <span class="BUILDING">collection center</span> which was in the former Jewish old age home.</sentence><sentence id="1110">I was able to get them some food, prayer book and so on, but then in a short time they were...this uh uh <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was was cleaned out and later then I found out that my parents, blessed memory, were were in one of the first transports which went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> directly, directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and certainly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh uh uh they they obviously got murdered the the first uh moment when they arrived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: How did you feel when they were taken?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1195">A: When they were taken?</sentence><sentence id="1196">Certainly I felt lost and and and call it depressed, but still I must say my my power of resistance was still there because I had...together with my wife, we had...call it we made a pledge, call it an oath, whatever it is...that we will not try...we will not give in, that whatever the circumstances, we will try to to to hold out.</sentence><sentence id="1197">And and and uh uh though we we have no means to communicate with the outside world, with relatives and friends left in the <span class="REGION">western world</span>, and so being alone and and but still uh this spark of life was still there, that uh in spite of everything that we will try to to remain alive, last not least to tell the tale, to tell our story later.</sentence><sentence id="1198">Still we didn't know at this time about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, so when I came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and and a neighbor of my parents told me, told us, certainly 11 | was I was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="1199">More than shocked, and and and it was almost...uh it didn't sink in immediately, that this...that I would never see them again, and that this this was the last... when they were when they were taken away, we couldn't manage to see them in the old age <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because this was closely guarded by the by the SS, so uh it didn't occur to me immediately, but certainly it affected me, but I said to myself I do not like to to that this bad news, the terrible news should overcome you or should should should paralyze me.</sentence><sentence id="1200">I would like...I would I would try whatever I can to survive, to survive this monster, and uh uh I think this is the spirit which which certainly I've tried to carry forward and also later, so uh when when...that was in December uh and then I think it was early in February, after the defeat in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, made a speech to which I listened inofficially, because as I told you, we were one of the last to have a radio...when he said well, uh uh certainly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> could not deny that this was some kind of a defeat, but now uh it...the time has come for the totalitarian...total war and uh the time has come also to uh to uh uh make a final uh...to to get even with the with the domestic enemy, with the internal enemy, and he used a certain expression which is , which means now uh people arise and storm uh uh uh...start in other words to uh to uh...like like uh I think it was as a parallel in history like uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 1870 when the the _I think they call it...to to have an uprising of the people in order to save Hitler and the the regime.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And uh soon thereafter, and I was still working in that labor gang and it was still , and though <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had entered already the war, uh we didn't feel the effect of it immediately because they had to get installed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they had started with the first air raids, but not towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Uh and then my sister was also supposed to be deported but since she was a (clearing throat) skilled stenographer and writer, they took her out to do secretarial service in the <span class="BUILDING">collection center</span>, so she was able to help me to get something to my parents there.</sentence><sentence id="1203">Uh and then we were...uh one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> after the other left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">Some cards...post cards, interesting enough, arrived from the people who had managed to throw post cards out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and none of them certainly knew exactly where they were going.</sentence><sentence id="1205">We heard rumors about uh...and I heard rumors about uh uh events in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, about the the attack, about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, about the murder uh uh...the uh killing actions in in these areas, but don't forget (clearing throat) that all this could not be confirmed.</sentence><sentence id="1206">This was just to the same extent that I asked my friend who listened to to to the radio, to BBC, what does BBC London say, and he said uh nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1207">There is a certain uh uh uh appeal or certain address which was delivered by where he indicated that uh Jews were taken away from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and so, but no hard facts</sentence><sentence id="1209">1 are available, and uh I also uh still had contact with my people of the of the Jewish organization, and when I had a chance I saw the head of that, at this time was Paul Epstein (ph) and we exchanged some more information, but all the information only said that there is a turn, but but we came to the conclusion (clearing throat) for the Jewish situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, it anyhow might come too late.</sentence><sentence id="1210">And uh uh then in in uh at the end of February, early in March, uh from one day to the other, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was was...there there started...there was...came the end of the so so-called final solution.</sentence><sentence id="1211">The SS, interesting enough, the elite SS called the of Hitler, occupied in the morning all <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where Jews were working in these groups, and certainly for them it was easy to get to to them, because they were working in groups.</sentence><sentence id="1212">I for one reason or the other had been advised the night before...said stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1213">You never know what's going on, and I was staying <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and uh then uh a neighbor came running and said I just heard they have taken away my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1214">He was working there and there and don't know where he is.</sentence><sentence id="1215">It's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1216">What is your...what what what can you do?</sentence><sentence id="1217">There's nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1218">You just have to to wait and see.</sentence><sentence id="1219">So I tried to read and to to to to even write a letter to a friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, because with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> there was still...since it was neutral uh you could have still uh an exchange of letters though it was censored, so uh uh and then uh uh in the afternoon of that day, two uh uh policemen who were members of the Gestapo came and told us that uh uh we we are under custody and we uh we uh in ten minutes we should leave.</sentence><sentence id="1220">Now in connection with all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, my then wife uh had prepared a knapsack with all kinds of things we thought would be helpful when we would go to the east to some kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and so what we expected, and had some some uh underwear and some books and the bible and and a chess set and so on, and certainly things for the for the boy, and uh had that ready so in order to grab it whenever whenever the occasion would arise.</sentence><sentence id="1221">And uh as I say in that afternoon they came, and gave us ten minutes and my son was sleeping, so we managed somehow to...we all, after all, spoke the same language, to tell them after all we have to get him ready and should give us some time and uh with some hesitation they said alright, we'll wait.</sentence><sentence id="1222">To talk to them was almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1223">Uh uh I tried but uh I knew it was dangerous because for these were people who were fanatic Nazis and and and they took...uh take out their wrath against you on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1224">They had the right to kill you on the spot and nobody...nobody would would take them uh to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> for that.</sentence><sentence id="1225">So uh then we took our knapsacks and we took our son and and and then we went down.</sentence><sentence id="1226">We were living in an in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the back of a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and uh uh when we came down we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> uh surrounded by SS guards with rifles.</sentence><sentence id="1227">It certainly was not a pleasant...pleasant uh uh moment, because we certainly didn't know what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And uh then we were...when we were ascended this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and saw other Jewish people because they all had the star and they all had the same destiny that their husbands had been

id="1231">It was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1232">It was...it was raining.</sentence><sentence id="1233">It was miserable and then they stopped and cruising and we were absolutely uncertain, but I had the wonderful feeling at least my wife and my son was with me.</sentence><sentence id="1234">The others were in that unfortunate situation</sentence><sentence id="1236">2 that they were separated from their families and uh also I must say my then wife was in a rather good mood and let's say whatever will come, will come, as long as we can stay together, and uh then we were taken to a to a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="1237">Don't forget that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was completely blacked out on account of the air raid sit...of the air situation, and uh then from that big <span class="NPIP">place</span> we were transferred...transferred to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh where also my parents had been before.</sentence><sentence id="1238">It's a collection point.</sentence><sentence id="1239">Also in between we were released for a day or two to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> again uh uh and we could do something because we had uh red arm bands to help uh to to be...to bring some food to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but that was only very minor.</sentence><sentence id="1240">There was nothing...nothing really where you could say uh you can help people.</sentence><sentence id="1241">We were all exposed to the same...to the same danger.</sentence><sentence id="1242">So uh uh and then uh uh again we were we were called in and we were taken in to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in in the <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span>, and on March 11, 1943, we were we were (clearing throat) made part of the transport.</sentence><sentence id="1243">Interesting enough, two days before we became...and I became the witness of the first major air raid of the American air force against <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1244">As long as the British air force came, certainly I mean they had tried what they do, but they are...the the damage they were they were inflicting on on on the on the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> were rather minor, though they were there I mean and it was...you never knew where they would hit and what would be hit, and we were part of that, but when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span> came, I mean there was...there for the first time I realized that was a massive attack and you'll see when we when we uh looked around that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was really burning, and we had to hope that the <span class="DLF">railway</span> uh uh would be destroyed, but that didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="1245">And then on the 11...uh March 11th we were made part of of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1246">Uh we were taken together with...I think we were all in all a thousand people out of that uh collection point.</sentence><sentence id="1247">Men...wo...men, women, children, elderly, young...and uh my sister was with me, with us and also luckily some of our friends from the youth movement and we tried to stick together.</sentence><sentence id="1248">We were uh shipped to a <span class="DLF">freight yard</span> within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and there were forced to board one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, uh approximately I think a hundred people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, so we could could hard...we couldn't lie.</sentence><sentence id="1249">We could hardly sit...mostly stand.</sentence><sentence id="1250">There was just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> for for for...there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for ventilation (clearing throat) and one bucket there for for hygiene purposes and uh...but still I would say that I, in spite of that, and also my then wife, had a feeling well, we'll take it...we can take it, because none of us uh was aware what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1251">Uh we didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="1252">Uh I only noticed on my watch that exactly at four o'clock in the afternoon this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left and was moving east, because I was familiar with the geography of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so we know we were were uh going to the east, and uh as a matter of fact, uh since we were together with other other friends, in order to to not kill times but to somehow alleviate the situation within ourselves somehow started to sing Jewish songs we had uh learned uh uh in the in the youth movement. .</sentence><sentence id="1253">How nice is it to to be with friends, under those conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1254">It's absurd today, you know, but you see this was still part of the of the mood we were in, and I remember that also my wife also wrote some of these cards which were very safe because you could throw them through the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and sometimes they were picked up and people uh then mailed them.</sentence><sentence id="1255">Uh it was Friday night and uh when it became dark, interesting enough, one of the ladies there uh aware of</sentence><sentence id="1257">3 this was a Friday night, uh took out some candles she had prepared, was lighting the candles, was bless...blessing the candles, and and and uh expressing the prayers, you know, to welcome the Sabbath, and you know, the...later very often thought about this, you know, what...how how absurd life can be that, you know, here there was a group, just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death wagon</span> of a hundred people, most probably ninety percent of them did not live to see the next evening anymore, but still riding in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, they were blessing God and welcoming uh the Sabbath, in that mobile uh <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to we still didn't know where.</sentence><sentence id="1258">So we traveled all night and uh then I realized in the morning that we were going via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> (ph) in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and uh uh came to <span class="REGION">Upper Salasia</span> and uh then uh in the afternoon, almost twenty-four hours later, we uh we stopped in a kind of a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> uh and there I saw for the first time written the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I was not aware what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in spite of the fact that I had uh uh listened to to to BBC London, had tried to get all the information I could in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1260">We knew about uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1261">We knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1262"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>... didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1263">And uh obviously also at this time uh uh neither BBC London nor any other information uh sources, had any any concrete idea.</sentence><sentence id="1264"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was new.</sentence><sentence id="1265">So uh uh when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped uh they they they the <span class="DLF">doors</span> was opened and we were all somehow stiff and so it was a cold night and so and so, but we were driven out.</sentence><sentence id="1266">There were...there were SS guards with the with the uh uh uh sticks and uh yelling like animals, and uh beating people out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1267">Uh there I also saw when we left our uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> that two of our people who were with us or three had committed suicide, so uh uh because they probably...it was it was too much for them, and then outside we were we were assembled on a <span class="DLF">platform</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1268">Uh we were ordered to leave all our uh belongings there, all our knapsacks we had prepared carefully and whatever it was remained there, and then they ordered us to uh line up in different groups, men, uh women with children, and women.</sentence><sentence id="1269">And this was the moment when when when I was separated from my wife and my child, and this is where my wife then said well, this is the moment I have...I was...I will be...I was afraid of.</sentence><sentence id="1270">As long as we were together...and sure enough uh uh this was the last uh uh day I have seen her and my child.</sentence><sentence id="1271">We were lining up and uh uh there stand a man in a in a very elegant SS uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Later I came to understand it was Dr. Mengele, and uh when he approached he asked only how old are you, what's your profession, and then he directed people to the left or to the right with his thumb.</sentence><sentence id="1273">And he asked me how old.</sentence><sentence id="1274">What's your <span class="BUILDING">profession</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1275">I certainly did not say that I was an administrator or a law student.</sentence><sentence id="1276">I said I was a welder, and he directed me to one group.</sentence><sentence id="1277">I had lost track of my wife and my son, but then also what I saw and what was completely new to me was all of a sudden women in SS uniform with with their pistol holsters, you know, where they...the pistol uh dangling, and they also prepare...behaved like animals, and they uh uh uh were especially busy with the women with children and the elderly and then we saw uh and I saw people in in a certain uniform I had never seen before, with stripped clothing and peculiar kind of a of a of a cap, and uh so then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> uh were were driving up and one group of people, especially the women with children and the elderly were put on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we still had to wait and uh then this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> left and it so happened that my wife and my my my son had...they were sitting or were standing at the end of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and my wife was somehow waving to me.</sentence><sentence id="1278">And</sentence><sentence id="1280">4 that was the last I've seen of her.</sentence><sentence id="1281">We had to wait and then were were were pressed into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and though we thought it was full already they they uh they still pushed I don't know how many people into...it was less...it was worse than sardines.</sentence><sentence id="1282">Uh and there certainly everywhere were SS guards.</sentence><sentence id="1283">We tried to uh to uh to uh speak to them, but interesting enough they hardly spoke German because they were what they called which means ethnic Germans, but their main major language was Polish, but they had volunteered obviously for the SS and did this kind of duty.</sentence><sentence id="1284">So we couldn't find out anything from them and then we were driven away from that <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and passed by a tremendous uh uh area of <span class="BUILDING">industrial buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1285">I don't know how many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> we could see that was under construction.</sentence><sentence id="1286">We couldn't understand what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1287">We didn't know...after all, we still didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1288">And uh then after having passed this area of <span class="BUILDING">industrial buildings</span>, uh we entered...we...all of a sudden I saw a a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> surrounded by by barbed wire, with <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> and SS guards with machine uh guns, machine pistols, and when we drove into this I said to my friends who were standing next to me from the youth movement and luckily we were still sticking together... may God help us to get out of here alive.</sentence><sentence id="1289">So uh that's the moment when when we had arrived and I had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1290">What happened to my wife and my son I did not know.</sentence><sentence id="1291">The others didn't know what happened to their people, so and then we were ordered uh to descent this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and and and uh were driven into to to some <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and were ordered to undress completely, only to keep our our shoes, our glasses certainly, our belts and uh then the SS ordered us to take off our rings, our watches, whatever...and uh uh then we were were...I together with these other people and we were approximately I would say two hundred people in this in this group, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...uh were were led into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1292">We were not quite clear what what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1293">It was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1294">It was miserable but even later when we...when the water came down although it was cold it was somehow, it was...believe it or not some kind of a relief after this trip that we hadn't eaten.</sentence><sentence id="1295">We had not...we were not in in very good shape, but in all tense (ph)...I | remember that everything that I...I said at this time to myself, register in your mind whatever is going on.</sentence><sentence id="1296">With God's help one day you might be be be called to give evidence about that, so somehow I I tried and not to forget and uh then we...after that...in that...then we were in that <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1297">A man came also with a uniform, with a stripped uniform, and we asked him who are you and he said I'm from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1298">I am a political prisoner, a Jew but a political prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1299">I have taken part in the uh fight of the of the Spanish Republicans against Franco.</sentence><sentence id="1300">I was caught there and and and and delivered by the Spanish to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1301">I am in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> already four years.</sentence><sentence id="1302">You have arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1303">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> here is named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.03322"

firm.</sentence><sentence id="1306">It's stocks were widely held, also by Jewish stockholders, so this is what you are going to do, and we asked what's about our chil...wives and

already.</sentence><sentence id="1310">You are lucky that you came now.</sentence><sentence id="1311">We, the old guards, the old timers, called old-timers are here already for years.</sentence><sentence id="1312">We have gone through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612"

best.</sentence><sentence id="1315">Try to be strong.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Try to take it.</sentence><sentence id="1317">Otherwise you are lost, and uh then after the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> was over, we we were given the same kind of uh dresses these people had.</sentence><sentence id="1318">It was not fitting, you know...it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1319">And some caps also with the same stripes, and then we were led to one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> we had seen there in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and a man who called himself the elder, the block elder, blockaltester, block elder received us.</sentence><sentence id="1320">He was a political prisoner who was uh allied with the communist party and so and had been caught very early, so he had already seven or eight years of imprisonment behind him, and he said I want you to be clean.</sentence><sentence id="1321">I want you to ____ and so and we were then given our our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, which means in this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there were rows of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, three tiers and there was...there was a thin blanket and the so-called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> was a straw sack and uh and uh we were given to understand that this is our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we can sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1322">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to leave your <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1323">There was...there was uh no <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh to rest, to sit down, so uh...and then I realized that uh...the events were so fast and so over-bearing and so shocking that it was not possible for me to fully analyze what was going on, but uh I realized one thing that certainly uh I I...that the Nazis had tried to dehumanize me by taking away all my private...my most private things, my hair, my clothing, to make me a number and that I was degraded to to become a slave, that I was a prisoner, that uh I was not any more able to do what I wanted to do, that I had to uh follow uh orders...how nonsensical they were...and uh that that all this in the name, I said, of German civilization...1 was puzzled.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And also uh especially then came a little bit...got used to this...came to the realization that there was no way out because uh certainly the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was was was surrounded by more than one <span class="DLF">fence</span> of barbed wire, was electrically loaded, that to run away would be impossible and even if so, in a <span class="REGION">Polish area</span>...it was still a Polish population where you don't know the language...was hopeless, so that the only hope which was there is to to live to to see uh that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was militarily defeated, and had surrendered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1465">Q: I think we should stop here... .</sentence><sentence id="1466">We're at a good <span class="NPIP">stopping point</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1469">END OF TAPE 3 ...I had to get out and uh one of the first things you learn in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>...one of the first things was to to make your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, and the Germans, the Nazis, in this respect uh they had an obsession for for for orderly uh <span class="BUILDING">bed building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1470">It had to be done in a mathematical, straight fashion and since I I had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> on top I was the first to have to do it because other...the people...and I had to stand on the on the rim of the of the second tier and the first tier, so, therefore, I had to finish it first and then the others could do it.</sentence><sentence id="1471">Now that was a thing, and then we were... was treated to my first uh breakfast there which consisted of an awfully tasting coffee and a piece of bread and and that was all.</sentence><sentence id="1472">Oh, a little piece of marg...of sausage or so... don't know, but anyhow this first day was a day when when we were registered and and and also again people came and asked what was your profession and I stick...was sticking to my lie that all my life I have been nothing but a welder, because people had told me who had been in in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span></sentence><sentence id="1474">6 before in the action that the Nazis despised tremendously any people looking somewhat intellectually or or professional or so the worst were the were the lawyers and and and when they found a lawyer they really...they they mistreated them very very badly.</sentence><sentence id="1475">So I said I was a welder and then we got we got...uh I got my number, which was 107984.</sentence><sentence id="1476">Uh we had to...I had to...I got some patches of of of stuff of linen and and had to to sew it on my uniform, and also then uh somebody came and tattooed this number on my left arm, so uh that means I I I...and I still have that...uh which means that you were completely uh uh...you were...you have become a number and one of the first things I said to myself is I would like to become not a number.</sentence><sentence id="1477">I had a number but I'd like not to become a number, so still there was that spirit of resistance if possible.</sentence><sentence id="1478">And then on that first day also I 1 went through something which never uh uh experienced before, what they call appell.</sentence><sentence id="1479">The Germans and the Nazis, they are in this respect and especially at this time, they had obstinent appell, you know, and counting was one of their hobbies.</sentence><sentence id="1480">Uh and they had it at least twice a day, so we were all led to a big <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a big square and there we had to line up...our <span class="DLF">block</span>...in in rows of five and had to wait until an SS man came, and there were...were the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the SS that was...the SS stormfurher which means captain.</sentence><sentence id="1481">Uh since it was cold, he had the privilege of wearing a nice fur coat, uh a military fur coat, so we were counted again and again and again, and uh uh then uh the next day, it was the first day when when when I was I was uh uh commanded, after the appell in the morning, to go to a certain kommando they called it, working...working uh squad or working platoon, and uh the newcomers had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="1482">They were attached to a very special one.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I only later I found this one of the kommands to uh to wear us down, to grind us down, uh which we called , the the killing...killing kommando, the murder kommando, uh number four.</sentence><sentence id="1484">So then we uh we we we we walked out, again in military order, uh always five because that was easier to count.</sentence><sentence id="1485">We were counted at the uh square before.</sentence><sentence id="1486">We were counted when we marched out and at this time the SS uh uh guards were walking with us left and right, so uh in other words each kommando had so and so many SS guards attached to them, and uh it was quite a....quite a distance we walked and uh...well, I was still able to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1487">Of course I had still a certain strength in me, and then uh uh then we were...we entered the factory area where where you had these num...numerous <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there under construction.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Uh <span class="DLF">streets</span> were not completed.</sentence><sentence id="1489">There was a lotofmud, __ soil, especially since it was a cold morning, it was all flour (ph) and we had...we had just the this very thin kind of dress and and and it was not easy and uh then I was led together with the others uh to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had to unload uh uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway wagons</span> of metal and cement and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1490">And this was done mostly uh not in an ordinary way, but running.</sentence><sentence id="1491">I mean metal...you cannot...big beams you cannot transport by running but but for instance when you have a sack of cement, then they wanted you to run because it had to be fast.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And also for the first time I became acquainted with an <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> I didn't know uh uh before, that each kommando had a a a inmate leader called kapo.</sentence><sentence id="1493">Where this term originated I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1494">I have never found out.</sentence><sentence id="1495">It comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1496">Uh but they called it kapo and it has been...had entered the the language of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, so you had a kapo as the leader of the...and he had certain foremans to to to help him, especially in bigger kommands,</sentence><sentence id="1498">7 bigger bigger bigger kommandos, but then you had the SS also so they all then uh uh were around us to to watch what we are doing and how we are doing it, that it went fast enough and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1499">And uh I remember that on that first day uh when we were when we were doing this kind of work and I had done part of it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> so it was not completely new to me...I I saw that one Jewish fellow of another kommando uh throw himself in front of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> of a small uh engine to commit suicide so that was the first that I 1 saw there uh and it was the first which was followed by many many more.</sentence><sentence id="1500">So uh when it came to uh to uh to uh the so-called lunch break, some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came with some watery soup which was called buna (ph) soup because the name of that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was Buna and it was provided by the firm which they think was a tremendous uh tremendous gain for us.</sentence><sentence id="1501">It was very often absolutely stinking and and and consisted of nothing but just water uh uh with some some vegetable remnants or so.</sentence><sentence id="1502">It's awful.</sentence><sentence id="1503">And so uh and since...and also we had...there was...yeah...one of our possessions was uh a bowl which you always had to carry with us.</sentence><sentence id="1504">That was your only possession and a spoon.</sentence><sentence id="1505">When we we got the soup, we couldn't sit down and so it all has to be...had to eaten standing up and then after a short while the the work continued up to the very end of the day.</sentence><sentence id="1506">So at the beginning...I mean it was hard but but but I also considered bearable, but then, you know, not a couple of days later...was early in March, uh terrible rain storms hit the <span class="REGION">area</span> and the <span class="REGION">area</span> became muddier than before so the work became more difficult, especially when you have to carry these cement bags.</sentence><sentence id="1507">That was not...the paper was not of the best quality so they very often broke and when you mix cement with water, you know, it it becomes very hard caked and it was setting also on your clothing and so...now the other problem was that I couldn't change...change the clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1508">II L...there was no way to clean yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1509">There was so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> but the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> was there for hundreds of people.</sentence><sentence id="1510">To get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucets</span> was almost impossible, so to keep clean was one of the most difficult things, and also there was always the danger uh that you you would acquire lice which then would would uh result in typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1511">So how to keep clean I don't know, but anyhow that that was one of the problems and also, you know, you certainly you didn't need a a a comb anymore because you had no hair, but you even didn't also didn't have a towel.</sentence><sentence id="1512">You had...really you had practically...you were devoid of any things uh uh which makes fundamentals of of life.</sentence><sentence id="1513">Who speaks about about books and paper and and...it didn't exist, simply did not exist.</sentence><sentence id="1514">You were really uh a slave.</sentence><sentence id="1515">You were rented out by the SS to .</sentence><sentence id="1516">Iwas, therefore, a slave working uh uh uh for the benefit of the SS for and I was aware of the fact that I was allowed to live only as long as I as I was able to do this kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="1517">The moment I became weak or the moment I would I would uh contract any any illnesses and so that was the end, so therefore I I also tried very hard to uh to keep myself clean but, of course, I mean especially when you had these rains and you came back in the evening and the the uh the uh so-called uniform was was covered with with the cement dust.</sentence><sentence id="1518">You went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and you were you were wet.</sentence><sentence id="1519">Everything was wet.</sentence><sentence id="1520">So how to sleep under those conditions I don't know, but but, you know, obviously human beings can can can can can can tolerate a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1521">Uh many of our people...I wouldn't say many...some of our people simply said enough is enough and uh I remember distinctly that that uh uh starting the third or fourth day uh certain of the people who were also in our transport and</sentence><sentence id="1523">8 were still in that same <span class="BUILDING">kommando</span>, simply when we were walking out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, ran what they called _ so the person had ran away, tried to ran away and then the SS started to shoot immediately and shooting him to death.</sentence><sentence id="1524">Uh and the SS loved to do that because for any for any victim I think they were paid at this time twenty or twenty-five marks and a bottle of of of cognac and so on and a day or two of rest.</sentence><sentence id="1525">And I remember for instance we were walking uh one one morning.</sentence><sentence id="1526">It was the fourth or fifth morning.</sentence><sentence id="1527">A father was walking with his son and the father then when we were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, gave the rest of his bread and whatever he had to his son and said uh uh I don't need it any more, gave it to his son, ran out in order to be shot, in the presence of his son.</sentence><sentence id="1528">And uh uh uh this I saw.</sentence><sentence id="1529">These first days uh especially became the the worst I would say in my life and very often when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know, we...after you came back from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, you were counted again.</sentence><sentence id="1530">You were counted when you entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1531">You were counted again in the evening, and uh this sometimes could last uh hours and hours because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was the place where where let us say where where scientists work on mathematics and make progress, but these people were not good in math, and very often when the when the when the numbers didn't didn't didn't jive, we had to wait and and and and they did not uh let us uh let us go before everything was was just just right to the last man, so it happened, for instance, I remember that one evening of the fourth or the fifth, one of the men of my transport just collapsed in front of us.</sentence><sentence id="1532">Uh we he was a cantor, a man I knew well because I had attended his service.</sentence><sentence id="1533">Weisman (ph) was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1534">A wonderful, powerful voice, and and and and well, highly-educated man.</sentence><sentence id="1535">He collapsed and when the appell was taken and the SS man came and kicked him with his with his foot and he could hardly move and uh then when the appell was...when the roll call was over, uh we decided we had to take him to the so-called uh emergency..the krackenbaugh, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and uh it was not easy for us to carry him but we did it because we thought it's the only way to help him, and then on the way, which was quite a long way over there at the end of the uh <span class="NPIP">place</span>, he expired and he died in our hands and uh uh this was, I must say, the first uh casualty I witnessed of somebody I knew well, and then from this day on, many many things happened because the resistance, the power of resistance somehow evaporated.</sentence><sentence id="1536">How I did it I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1537">I 1 thought out all kind... I also felt that I I became weaker.</sentence><sentence id="1538">As a matter of fact, one morning I fainted and my good friends uh lifted me up and the whole day was difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="1539">Uh but I somehow managed.</sentence><sentence id="1540">It was one of these miracles, but uh but uh uh after one month I would say, from the two hundred and twenty or so we had been when we were newcomers, only I think a hundred and fifty had survived, but to save the other's <span class="NPIP">place</span>, later, after liberation when I tried to find out how many of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> had survived, of the thousand who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, not more than six, and I am one of those.</sentence><sentence id="1541">So uh uh I myself asked the question, how long would I be able to to to tolerate that and uh also uh we were cut off.</sentence><sentence id="1542">We didn't know what what was the latest on the front.</sentence><sentence id="1543">We were waiting for the second <span class="NPIP">front</span> and didn't know any...hear anything because we were cut off from any news.</sentence><sentence id="1544">We didn't hear anything about uh what was going on on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>, so I said how long can it last.</sentence><sentence id="1545">And I remember that one moment then when I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, I found a piece of newspaper that probably an SS man had left there, and it so happened that I took into my...you know, pockets I</sentence><sentence id="1547">9 didn't have, but...yeah...was hiding it under my underwear and and, you know, we had to be careful to to to handle this and it so happened when I was in the <span class="DLF">block</span> with my friends I said watch that somebody should discover us and uh I read it and it so happened that was a piece with the report of the of the German Wiermacht saying that they had been driven out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krackow</span> (ph) which gave me an idea that the front, the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>, was advancing, but more I didn't know, but somehow it it added again, you know, to the spark of life and uh then uh there was another day when I almost lost uh my my my uh belief that I would be able to make it.</sentence><sentence id="1548">In our group was a man who uh uh was very active also in our youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="1549">He uh was uh uh a Jewish civil employee, and he was a man with a beautiful voice.</sentence><sentence id="1550">He had studied music because he wanted to become a cantor, and he had been in another kommando and uh I met him and he was desperate.</sentence><sentence id="1551">I said to him uh...his name was Fritz Shafer (ph)...uh what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1552">He said I've had enough.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I can't take it any longer.</sentence><sentence id="1554">I said what are you going to do.</sentence><sentence id="1555">He said I have uh...I was sick.</sentence><sentence id="1556">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1557">After three days they threw me out.</sentence><sentence id="1558">I can hardly stand on my feet and I don't like to be to be to be kicked to death, so I'd rather take my own life, so I argued with him.</sentence><sentence id="1559">I said Fritz, how can you do it.</sentence><sentence id="1560">Think what we have gone through.</sentence><sentence id="1561">Think what we have been taught.</sentence><sentence id="1562">How can you take your own life.</sentence><sentence id="1563">After all, you are observant Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1564">It's un-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1565">He said, this is my decision.</sentence><sentence id="1566">I don't want to be to be to be kicked to death, because what happened here...for this there is no provision in the bible and in in our scriptures, and the next day I heard in the morning whatever shooting going on during the night.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Very often the SS guards on the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span>, they were sometimes shooting because...to keep themselves awake let us say, and they could order you...they had these Jews that they saw something in there for the...it was suspicious and therefore they were firing, so uh so we heard shooting constantly, and next day somebody said you know, did you hear the shooting this morning.</sentence><sentence id="1568">I said yes, what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1569">They said your friend, Fritz Shafer...he uh he uh he tried to be admitted to the to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1570">They didn't accept him, so he said under those conditionsII1___ went against the...you know, this was one of the ways in which people also put an end to their misery.</sentence><sentence id="1571">They went to the to the <span class="DLF">wire</span> and then the fellow from the the gangster from the...the SS gangster from the <span class="BUILDING">watch tower</span> was shooting because that was his order, so he went to the <span class="DLF">wire</span> in order to be shot and and that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1572">And I remember it still...it was on April 3rd, 1940..."43, soon after we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1573">Uh so when I heard this, I must say I 1 1 1 was almost lost because I had lost a battle and I saw the parallel and I was uh said...asking myself how long will we all be able to make that, and then uh one day or two days later, all of a sudden there was uh uh a special roll call that people should register again their their their uh profession, so that gave me another hope and uh there was what they called the labor service, .</sentence><sentence id="1574">Again registered and I registered myself again as welder.</sentence><sentence id="1575">The uh reason was that the Germans had lost on account of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> a lot of manpower, had uh uh inducted into the army also skilled labor, so they were short of labor, and obviously were interested to to now somehow in our in our skill, if you want to.</sentence><sentence id="1576">Sol ITT uh registered.</sentence><sentence id="1577">Nothing came out of it but somehow it gave me some hope, and there was another event which uh was of immense importance.</sentence><sentence id="1578">All the time when when I was there at the beginning, we were constantly under the under the supervision of the SS gangsters, and they</sentence><sentence id="1580">0 were brutal, brutal, brutal uh uh beings.</sentence><sentence id="1581">I cannot say human beings.</sentence><sentence id="1582">So uh uh even, you know, when you wanted to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and so you had you had to to to honor by taking off your cap and asking for permission, for his permission and so on and what they did in order to play around was very often to take, when you when you take off your cap, take the cap and throw it away and when the moment when you...when the people went to get, to collect the cap, then the SS man was shooting him on the pretense that he was trying to uh to uh to uh run away, so uh that...and this this was the uh the situation the first couple of weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1583">Also in connection with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> defeat uh they then came to the conclusion that they wanted to save manpower and they organized the uh the uh guards in such a way that they were surrounding completely the whole area of that <span class="BUILDING">industrial complex</span>, so that when we marched out, when we got into into into the <span class="INT_SPACE">factory area</span>, the SS stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> uh keeping guard out...yeah, keeping guard <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but we marched in only with the kapos.</sentence><sentence id="1584">And that alleviated certainly the situation somehow because then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> in order to keep their pos...their position who were very, very rough with their own people...they were mostly German criminals and and anti-social elements and so they then were not not not provoked anymore by the SS to to to become tougher with the...so this helped somehow, but still it was no no no no solution and and as I say, I 1 11 thought what what...still I was able to move but but I said something has to had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1585">For instance, we were then...I was put in another kommando under the command of a kapo who was a Polish criminal.</sentence><sentence id="1586">He had committed one or two murders uh and and he was such a human being the only regret he had that he had waited too long to murder his wife and his mother-in-law, so uh so uh and he was taking...he was not sent...sentenced to death for one reason or the other because uh...so uh he was a kapo there and he had uh used the foul language especially in Polish, because he was also was also one of these ethnic Germans who didn't know exactly where they belonged.</sentence><sentence id="1587">You know, they they they they they had a double standard.</sentence><sentence id="1588">They wanted to be Germans, and at the same time uh uh they wanted to to remain with their fellow Poles, so uh...and he he uh he was the head of a digging kommando, and that was also that was that that uh he was called in a German expression was Juden Franz (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1589">Franz is a German name, but Juden Franz was Jew Franz he got because he was a grinder of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1590">He had shown so many Jewish uh casualties on his conscious.</sentence><sentence id="1591">And he would always say, well I had to do it in order to enforce the _, and we were not protected.</sentence><sentence id="1592">There was no protected because not only had I lost my my my name and my hair and my clothing and my family...I also had had lost completely my my right to claim any human rights.</sentence><sentence id="1593">And uh that's what certainly these these people, these gangsters knew very well that there was no protection and uh then one day uh the uh the uh...we were called again to the <span class="BUILDING">labor office</span>, again for registration, but this time in the presence of a representative of .And again we were asked what is your uh uh profession, name...uh not name, number and profession, and I said welder.</sentence><sentence id="1594">He was somehow doubtful, for what reasons, but uh then he asked me certain technical questions and I was able to answer them, and then uh uh two days later I was transferred into a kommando where I I got out of this grinding work of transport, digging, and all this and uh was attached to what they call a German meister (ph) uh and uh uh the work was...and it was a great help...was to clean big plates which were used in the uh gasoline</sentence><sentence id="1596">1 columns which had come in order to uh to be installed in the in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1597">That gave me a chance somehow to to to to rest a little bit in between because I was not under the super...this the kapo there was a political prisoner from from ___--_-- so uh I could recover a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1598">The only thing which I dreaded very much that because of that I was transferred also into another lager, to another <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and had not the daily contact with my friends there who were still doing work and as | in that terrible kommando there.</sentence><sentence id="1599">Well, uh so uh uh especially, as I say, uh uh at the beginning uh life or the day in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was simply a day of getting up, starting to run, uh being exposed to uh to uh the whim of the blockaltester or kapo, so hardly be able to to sit, uh watching what what what uh left and right uh what what was happening so that it shouldn't happen to you and especially uh to to try to to do the work, which was not work, which was really slave work reminding you somehow of the illustrations you saw inthe ___-- when the Jews in in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> were building the <span class="DLF">pyramids</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1600">Uh it, as I say, it improved somehow, and I felt at least the improvement uh when when when the SS guards were taken away...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1746">Q: At that point did you make a decision to try to ration your energy very carefully?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1748">How soon did you do that...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1749">A: Especially when I when when I came to the conclusion that what little I had, I had to to stretch out my energy.</sentence><sentence id="1750">For instance, there was...I don't know if it's right, but I got the bread in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1751">I didn't eat it immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1752">I kept a little bit and kept it in my pocket somehow so that they say, when when it's drier, then it has more nourishing value, or one instance I tried to uh to uh to uh...especially after the SS was taken away from the kommandos, to go to the to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> unobserved as often as possible to have to have a minute of rest, or for instance uh you know, uh uh we had as tool only our bowl and a and a and a and a spoon.</sentence><sentence id="1753">Now I came to the conclusion in order to cut the bread...we had no knives certainly.</sentence><sentence id="1754">That was dangerous for the Germans, for the German state.</sentence><sentence id="1755">Uh I sharpened part of that of that spoon so that it was easier somehow to cut in order to save energy and and and this...and also uh uh uh what I tried in spite of all obstacles to to to remain clean.</sentence><sentence id="1756">Uh because I realized that the moment I would give in, that could be the end easily, so uh uh and then when I was working for that first German meister, uh uh who was who was more or less pleasant, uh uh because he treated me not as an inmate, as a heftling, as a slave.</sentence><sentence id="1757">He treated me as somebody who was like a helper or uh...not in his category but as a helper and uh then I tried, you know, to sit down as often as possible and to to relax to to...whenever I could and not to exert myself, do anything special, certainly not to run anymore and so to try to to to walk in a way that that I don't consume too much ener...energy.</sentence><sentence id="1758">Uh after a certain while I lost that job because there was a conflict between and the and the and the which was doing this kind of work and uh then I was uh uh handed over to another fellow who...as a welder...uh the German meister who came from <span class="REGION">Saxony</span> (ph) and he was a first class worker, but his religion as you have it very often in in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...his whole religion was work.</sentence><sentence id="1759">He didn't understand anything about politics.</sentence><sentence id="1760">His politics was work.</sentence><sentence id="1761">He didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="1762">He didn't like the war but this doesn't affect it.</sentence><sentence id="1763">He was just...as long as he could work, and he was</sentence><sentence id="1765">2 very proud in his work, so at the beginning it was not so easy because I was not an accomplished welder, but I tried to learn from him and he realized that and I must say in all fairness, he treated me like an equal.</sentence><sentence id="1766">And when he saw that I made progress in whatever he wanted me to do, then he gave me some cigarettes uh which I didn't use certainly because I then bartered the cigarettes for bread which was very important, also to to get up some more energy.</sentence><sentence id="1767">And uh uh so uh also what was a tremendous advantage, that uh when I worked with him I could work under a <span class="DLF">roof</span> so that the elements...I was not exposed to the elements.</sentence><sentence id="1768">I also remember that uh when I entered this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I worked then, I for the first time in weeks I saw a mirror, and I looked myself into the mirror and I was aghast.</sentence><sentence id="1769">I was simply...I 1 1 mean this was the worst, one of the worst things I must say that happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="1770">I didn't recognize myself anymore, certainly without hair, unshaven you know, because we had a chance only to to be shaven once a week, and I said for goodness sake, what happened to you.</sentence><sentence id="1771">Uh uh but still the fact that I was somehow now in a better <span class="NPIP">position</span> helped me tremendously and and I was still felt sorry that for my other friends that they having no skill and having nothing to offer in this respect were not able to alleviate their situation somehow, and uh so I I I worked with this man for a certain while and again then something changed uh because because uh uh uh they wanted to have welders in in in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> directly.</sentence><sentence id="1772">There was a welder kommando and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.03322" long="19.29246">Buna</span> was constantly expanding and at the beginning when I came, the total of was approximately two thousand or two thousand five hundred.</sentence><sentence id="1773">Then we we we grew to approximately ten thousand.</sentence><sentence id="1774">What they did was also that uh they uh and the Germans were...the Nazis did things which are not well known but should be should be recorded.</sentence><sentence id="1775">At a certain time, they established <span class="BUILDING">brothels</span> for the German uh inmates and the Polish inmates, and they brought prostitutes from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into a special <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where the the the Polish uh uh inmates, non-Jewish Polish inmates, or the German inmates had an opportunity to go whenever there was...there was a certain schedule for that.</sentence><sentence id="1776">There was a special <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> built in the middle of the and we were called to uh to do the heating there, to establish the heating so they needed welders and I was one of them which gave me a tremendous uh uh...which was a tremendous help.</sentence><sentence id="1777">Number one, I mean I was suffering from certain , from from swollen feet, so I didn't have to walk these long distances to the to the to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and uh also I became acquainted with the with the people there inthe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> _ people and so and I started to do certain things in my free time, using scrap and making hooks for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, or or for the curtains and things like that and L..and it turned...there was no money.</sentence><sentence id="1778">I mean none of us was allowed to have any money certainly, so you were bartering for bread and and and so this kind of work uh uh uh...I wouldn't say I liked but it was helpful also to to come back to my to my somehow to my health and to my to my energy.</sentence><sentence id="1779">Uh also uh in in...in between I started to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in in that <span class="REGION">area</span> with a with a with a man who was, interesting enough, a Polish national but who was an artist as a welder and I learned a lot from him, and...though he was a very nationalistic Pole, he was no anti-Semite.</sentence><sentence id="1780">He was special, and we got on good terms.</sentence><sentence id="1781">Uh he bought me papers, newspapers, I mean and once in a while a piece of of of of uh sausage.</sentence><sentence id="1782">I even could could ask him to write for me a letter to a neighbor of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> with whom I had left some money and some things, and</sentence><sentence id="1784">3 sure enough this lady, a wonderful lady, wrote back and and sent money and some food to this Polish man, so I left him with the money because I couldn't use the money.</sentence><sentence id="1785">It was too dangerous but he gave me the food and that was manna for me.</sentence><sentence id="1786">So uh uh and also this... === s was his name...he had a very interesting technique.</sentence><sentence id="1787">Since he hated the Germans so much, uh and hated certainly to work for _ for the war effort, he had developed a certain technique, you know, when you weld pipes you have to be very careful because uh under high pressure they could burst easily and therefore you have to be have to be very accurate.</sentence><sentence id="1788">I knew how to do this.</sentence><sentence id="1789">I knew how to do it, and then he taught me how to do it that it looked good from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, was bad from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, by, for instance, apply more oxygen or an abundance of oxygen so that bubbles would would would would build inside the the the metal and it would...the weld of metal, and certainly the pressure...and the pipes would not be able to to to to tolerate the pressure.</sentence><sentence id="1790">Uh and that's how...I say when I worked with him for the first time, we established a contact.</sentence><sentence id="1791">Then I I worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the...partly to establish that <span class="BUILDING">brothel</span> and then when I was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I heard one day that there were British prisoners of war who had appeared in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and sure enough, uh what the Germans had done was uh the British, as you know from the records, had fought Rommel in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span>, had surrendered at _--.:</sentence><sentence id="1792">The soldiers who had been taken prisoner in__ had been brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> got out of the war, the Germans didn't let them go but transferred them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to <span class="REGION">Upper Salasia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1793">was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a tremendous prisoner of war camp and against the rules and regulations of the Geneva Convention, they brought of these prisoners of war to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, not to work like us, I mean like inmates, but in their uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1794">Uh they had a special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a special prisoner of war camp and they were guarded by German...by German soldiers, by by by by by army soldiers, but they put them to work in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and when I heard this I said I have to come...I have to meet them.</sentence><sentence id="1795">How I didn't know, so I uh arranged it somehow that I got an assignment with the same kommando I was before, this ...(pause) and uh when I saw the the the...they also when they got into the...under the uh uh area of their __ <span class="BUILDING">complex</span>, they were marching, but they were marching differently than we were.</sentence><sentence id="1796">They were marching to such extent that the German guards were mostly elderly fellows and they could hardly uh keep up with them, and when they saw us, I tell you they were throwing cigarettes at us and whatever they had and uh keep up these good spirits and so it was tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="1797">And uh I could almost weep when I when I saw that.</sentence><sentence id="1798">That was a tremendous...tremendous uh...give us a spirit...tremendous spiritual uplift, and I could feel it and then I I thought how could I come into contact and luckily when I was transferred back to that fellow ____, uh British uh prisoners of war were working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and under very, very careful circumstances and all because they had to be careful.</sentence><sentence id="1799">Uh uh I was then able to establish contact with them, and luckily my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> English was good enough...__ English which I had improved during my my years at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1800">The British were very careful, on an individual basis, because they never knew with whom they were meeting, you know, and slowly but surely, and I say it with pride, I was able to to establish a very close personal contact and the moment the this kind of <span class="DLF">sound barrier</span> was was was pierced, they became the best friends you could imagine, and what they did was not</sentence><sentence id="1802">4 only for me but many others, for instance, they had, you know, there was a different categories of of soup for the luncheon and uh the quality of our soup was the worst.</sentence><sentence id="1803">The quality for the German civilians was the best.</sentence><sentence id="1804">For the English prisoners of war, theirs was in between, but they didn't need it.</sentence><sentence id="1805">They didn't want it because luckily they had their International Red Cross parcels, so, therefore, they had already clients amongst our people, our inmates, to give them the soup which was very helpful because it was of better quality and uh they uh...since I was on such terms with them, they helped me with chocolates and and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1806">At the end actually I had British...when I walked out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I had British socks.</sentence><sentence id="1807">I had British shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1808">I had British underwear, so uh uh because they had enough of that stuff and they didn't need all this, but what was most important was...or two things] ___ the British ___-- was, one day uh uh they told us that would...you know, they they they they had chocolate and cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1809">They were also trading with the civil population in that in that in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, in that complex, uh so they they were able to construct a radio set via uh like in what...<span class="BUILDING">Stalag 18</span> (ph), you know...and they every night were listening to BBC London.</sentence><sentence id="1810">They had certainly technically tech...people with technical knowledge and so on, uh so...hiding it certainly from different German guards and after I had established this uh atmosphere of confidence with them, uh they uh agreed to tell me what they have heard, so that I actually was able to uh to uh to follow the news of BBC London in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and compare this news with what was written in the newspapers...discuss it with them.</sentence><sentence id="1811">Also they asked me...once in a while, you know, they met girls, Ukrainian girls, Polish girls.</sentence><sentence id="1812">They said they fell in love with them, or girls from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and they wanted to communicate with them but the girls certainly didn't understand understand English, so I volunteered to write in German to these girls.</sentence><sentence id="1813">After the war, when it's over, we'll come and marry you and I give you my word as a prisoner of the of the of the English uh soldier that I will never forget you and so so that was that was that was uh uh with them and and I must say this this helped uh tremendously, because it it kept us...at least kept me...I couldn't communicate with everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but with the close circle of friends I had, what we had heard and what what what the progress were and one one of the most was...emotional days was when first uh there came the news...you must remember that by error a girl had played around with a telegraph in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and the the news had gone out that the Allies had landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, and then it turned out it was a hoax, but on the day when they did land, uh somehow there was an electrifying atmosphere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the Germans became very nervous, and I immediately went to my friends and said what what uh happened.</sentence><sentence id="1814">They said we don't know because we don't like to talk about it before we have a confirmation, and the next morning uh uh they were jubilant and almost drunken, so said it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1815">They have landed, and then I could come back to my friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and said listen, that's it, and it's created... mean then we somehow we we knew that it was simply a matter of time when when when the the front in the east and in the west would come clear and though we were more or less aware that the Nazis might not allow us to live to to to experience the day of liberation, that at least that that there's some hope.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And that that we can look forward to that moment eventually, so uh as I say, the the role of the of the British prisoner...
