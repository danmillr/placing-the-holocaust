<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Will you begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Simon Federman.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, on March 1, 1926.Q. Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</sentence><sentence id="5">A. Before the war, my parents originally came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in the beginning of the 1920s.</sentence><sentence id="6">My father was a watchmaker, jeweler.</sentence><sentence id="7">We had a very modest life because he never made a lot of money, but it was a quiet simple life.</sentence><sentence id="8">I had three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="9">One of them passed away.</sentence><sentence id="10">We were not religious people, maybe the reason was it wasn't very easy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in those years to buy kosher food.</sentence><sentence id="11">It would have been an effort.</sentence><sentence id="12">My mother stopped after a little while to go to a small Jewish section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to buy kosher food.</sentence><sentence id="13">So, we started to live like everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> without being kosher, and our religion was not very, very important in our <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">During the 1930s, even I being a young boy, listening to the radios, reading some newspapers, hearing my parents when they were talking, we heard what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">You know, we were religious, but we still were very Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="16">I knew personally some of the tradition.</sentence><sentence id="17">I knew some of the holidays, but I never went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">But this being Jewish I knew it and I felt it; 1 was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="19">What was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> touched us.</sentence><sentence id="20">In the later 30s I started to see some people coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they were Jews who were running away.</sentence><sentence id="21">I was hearing some of the hardship they had in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">But it didn't you know it was something I heard, but I didn't feel it.</sentence><sentence id="23">I was too young, but I knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="24">In 1939, just before the war, I was listening to the radio like most of the people and we heard that there might be a war against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, there might be a war, but we didn't have to worry about it because we were so strong.</sentence><sentence id="26"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was so strong, that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ever they are doing anything, we would run over them in a very short time.</sentence><sentence id="27">And all this was lies.</sentence><sentence id="28">But we believed it.</sentence><sentence id="29">Every single day we heard that propaganda And the poor folks everything was a lie, because it took the German army to conquer <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in a couple weeks.</sentence><sentence id="32">Q. In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> you went to a public school?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="33">Q. And were you friends very mixed?A. Mixed?Q. Catholic, Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="34">A. Mixed, that's how religion is because we didn't have any allies, we didn't have any black people, because before the war it was very rare when you saw a black person in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">So, when we talk about mix, it was religion.</sentence><sentence id="36">But like I say, I didn't feel any different between the Christian and me.</sentence><sentence id="37">Enough of this, I have the feeling it never went to their mind that I was different than they were.</sentence><sentence id="38">Because we were a small minority, and as long as they knew that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">I spoke like them.</sentence><sentence id="40">I didn't have any accent, so I must have been in their mind, I'm sure, they must have thought I was like them, a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="41">Even when I was in the Army, it never went to their mind that I could have been different.</sentence><sentence id="42">That's how religion was.</sentence><sentence id="43">My mannerism and everything was Parisian.</sentence><sentence id="44">Q. You never were aware of anti-semitism as a boy?A. I knew it existed because I knew how you know sometime when people were arguing or fighting they said to somebody else, you know, he's a dirty Jew.</sentence><sentence id="45">But I don't know, but it never was addressed to me, because I don't want to sound macho, but I wouldn't have tolerated it.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, they did nothing to me.</sentence><sentence id="47">I already didn't feel anti-semitism.</sentence><sentence id="48">I didn't feel anything like that when I was a young kid in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">I was like anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="50">Q. What do you remember about the Germany occupation, the first days?A. What I remember is I really saw the Germans in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't see them in 1939, because when the war started my father was called into the army and like the result of all that propaganda and all this they mobilized a million people, but they were not ready for it.</sentence><sentence id="52">My father had half of a uniform, no guns, sleeping in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">You know, this was supposed to be the 12 median French army.</sentence><sentence id="54">So, the commander decided, and I think in the end of 1939, tried to evacuate women and children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Not because we didn't know you know the Germans were going</sentence><sentence id="57">to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, whatever, so they decided -- and also I remember in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they gave us some gas masks, that you were supposed to carry at all times with our gas masks in it.</sentence><sentence id="58">Like I was saying before, they decided to evacuate women and children and we were to register, the women and children, and they send us out I think about 100 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, in small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And this is where my mother, my sister and myself went.</sentence><sentence id="60">It lasted a few months, until the Germans really had their offensive.</sentence><sentence id="61">One day the offensive, they had a big offensive all of a sudden they are finally I think they realized they had so many men in the army, but they didn't have anything to give them.</sentence><sentence id="62">So, what they did, they released my father who had four children.</sentence><sentence id="63">When my father was released, the first thing he did was go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we were.</sentence><sentence id="64">When he got there, he heard on the radio where the German army is advancing and the French government did something also not very smart.</sentence><sentence id="65">They made a call over the radio that all men 13 years old must try to move to to reform and fight the Germans there.</sentence><sentence id="66">I never saw a gun in my life.</sentence><sentence id="67">I'm 13 and they're going to make me fight there.</sentence><sentence id="68">But, we decided the Germans are not going to catch us.</sentence><sentence id="69">We didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">We didn't have anything, we started to work, and we found some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> going by or whatever and we got a lift.</sentence><sentence id="71">We got to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and then we tried to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and we finally got to .Q. When was this?A. 1940.Q. In June?A. I think it was the early part of 1940, maybe in June.</sentence><sentence id="72">May, June, I don't remember very well.</sentence><sentence id="73">It wasn't very cold.</sentence><sentence id="74">Q. But you hadn't yet seen Germans coming in?A. I didn't see them.</sentence><sentence id="75">We knew while we were on the <span class="DLF">road</span> going to we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> bombing us.</sentence><sentence id="76">You know you had thousands and thousands of refugees, you know, the farmer was there with his animals.</sentence><sentence id="77">We had people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, people walking.</sentence><sentence id="78">You're talking about people on the and all of a sudden you saw those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> come in, he started shooting.</sentence><sentence id="79">So, my father, we finally reached the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span>, and we met another refugee</sentence><sentence id="81">like this and talking to them, some of them were Jewish, and they said we are going over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Purinae</span>, over to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">If you have anybody in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, try to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">The <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> will try to get you some papers to reach <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">So, my father had a brother there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">So, we said, Okay, let's try it.</sentence><sentence id="86">When we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> we were stopped.</sentence><sentence id="87">We said okay, we are going to go in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> but what's going to end up with my mother and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="88">I cannot abandon them.</sentence><sentence id="89">So, we decided to go back.</sentence><sentence id="90">We couldn't leave my mother.</sentence><sentence id="91">So, we decided to go back because we could not abandon my mother and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="92">And then <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was divided.</sentence><sentence id="93">Already the German army stopped in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with an armistice and the <span class="REGION">northern part</span>, the Germans were there, and the <span class="REGION">southern part</span> was the Vichy government.</sentence><sentence id="94">So, I don't remember exactly the date, but we got on board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">In the meantime, my mother and sisters were back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and when I got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="REGION">South France</span>, <span class="REGION">northern part</span>, this is when I saw the Germans for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="96">They went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but it wasn't that important because he had so many people trying to get back to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so they didn't look at us too close.</sentence><sentence id="97">We got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">Q. Was it frightening to see the German presence?A. No, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="99">It was orders and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="100">Q. Was it fairly easy to go back and forth between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> and --?A. It was not easy.</sentence><sentence id="101">It was not easy because after that you need a visa, which we are talking a few days after the armistice was signed.</sentence><sentence id="102">So, I really don't think they were organized to really put a lot of control, you know, between the north and the south.</sentence><sentence id="103">So, we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then life went back more or less normal.</sentence><sentence id="104">You saw Germans in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">All of a sudden a few months later, I think it was the beginning of 1941, all of a sudden we were told if we were a Jew, we had to register.</sentence><sentence id="106">We had to go to what we called police, you know the man in the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to register as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="107">But not really knowing what anti-semitism was, so we really didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="108">If you want to know if we are Jews, we are Jews.</sentence><sentence id="109">We went there and there were <span class="DLF">lines</span> of people who registered.</sentence><sentence id="110">I think at that time they put a stamp on our identification card, because every French person must have an identity card, and they gave us a gold star, a</sentence><sentence id="112">Jewish star, the Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="113">They told us you must put it on your clothes.</sentence><sentence id="114">And also, certain restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="115">If we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span>, we were to go only in the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">We were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">public places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">So, my mother sewed my clothes, the Jewish star.</sentence><sentence id="118">The next day, I told my mother, take it off, please.</sentence><sentence id="119">She said, no why?</sentence><sentence id="120">I said, nothing doing.</sentence><sentence id="121">I said if they are going to decide to pick me up, I'm not going to make it easy for them.</sentence><sentence id="122">You know, I don't look exactly like what the Germans think a Jew looks like, you know with the big nose and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="123">I said no.</sentence><sentence id="124">After arguing for a little while, she took it off.</sentence><sentence id="125">I could not accept those restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="126">I wanted to be able to go into a <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">I want to get into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">move</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="129">The danger was not that great.</sentence><sentence id="130">And after that, we noticed something else.</sentence><sentence id="131">They were starting to pick up Jews, but they were picking up mostly foreign Jews.</sentence><sentence id="132">We noticed what they were doing, they knew people were coming back from work at 6:00 at night, so they were closing off <span class="DLF">streets</span> not far from the main <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">So, I worked out with my father.</sentence><sentence id="134">I said I'll go at the time he was supposed to come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I will walk in front of him about 1,500 hundred feet.</sentence><sentence id="135">If I saw them, closing the <span class="DLF">street</span> I being a young fellow, I could run pretty fast in those days, I was running back and I would have told him and we would have taken another way of going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">This is what we did for a while.</sentence><sentence id="137">Q. Now, let me ask you something.</sentence><sentence id="138">You were born in Paris?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="139">Q. But your parents were not born --?A. My parents were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">Q. Would they have been vulnerable to the roundups?A. No, no, because you see lucky for us, my father and my mother thought <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is not for them.</sentence><sentence id="141">They were born there and they saw the anti-semitism.</sentence><sentence id="142">They saw how bad it was for the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">So, one day they decided to -- the original idea was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but they couldn't get a visa.</sentence><sentence id="144">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, in the early 20s needed people to work in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> in <span class="REGION">northern France</span>, to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, things like that, so they were letting foreigners come to do the work that Frenchman would not do.</sentence><sentence id="145">So, my father got a job with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Renault</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">He had in mind, I</sentence><sentence id="148">can't go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I'm going to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">I might as well try to become a Frenchman.</sentence><sentence id="150">I have the privilege and obligation of a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="151">I don't want to be a foreigner in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">So, what he did, after a couple of years, he applied for citizenship and he was a Frenchman and my mother and this is what French people do.</sentence><sentence id="153">Being born would have made me a Frenchman, but still they were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="154">So, you know, they were picking on the foreign Jews more or less, but we knew it was a matter of time for us.</sentence><sentence id="155">So, this was our life from about 1941 to 1942.Q. Were you in school?A. I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but they were looking for trouble.</sentence><sentence id="157">They give us all the time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">I couldn't continue with certain things.</sentence><sentence id="159">They put me in another <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, some kind of what do you call, <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">They really tried to get us out all the time.</sentence><sentence id="161">This was until 1942.</sentence><sentence id="162">In the beginning of 1942, I think the end of June or the beginning of July, all of a sudden we heard it was going to be bad for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="163">We already had all those laws.</sentence><sentence id="164">We had all those restrictions, and talking to some older fellows they told me a little bit more about it.</sentence><sentence id="165">They said they know from somebody in the police department they messed up picking up the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">I think it was the 14th of 15th of July all of a sudden I was told to warn the Jews in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that I knew, they were coming to pick up the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="167">But they are going to pick up the men and the boys.</sentence><sentence id="168">This is what they are going to pick up.</sentence><sentence id="169">So, they asked me to warn anybody I knew.</sentence><sentence id="170">Those people must have been from the resistance, I don't know where, but they had the knowledge I didn't have, and they told me, they asked me to do it.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, I started to tell everybody I knew.</sentence><sentence id="172">I chose men and boys and on the 15th it will happen.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, again you warn everybody.</sentence><sentence id="174">So, a lot of men with their sons who believed it will happen, who believed us, they tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and to see what will happen.</sentence><sentence id="175">I went with my older sister, -- let me go back to something.</sentence><sentence id="176">Let me go back to something else.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was getting very bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the beginning of 1942, and we knew two people that we had contact with, the Germans are really going to go after us, with the help of the French police.</sentence><sentence id="178">So some people started to organize a way of getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">free zone</span> and those people were helping people to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">free zone</span> where what we called , people who were passing people on</sentence><sentence id="180">the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">Some did it for money.</sentence><sentence id="182">Some did it because they wanted to help.</sentence><sentence id="183">So, when we saw what was going on, the first thing we did was try to get my father out.</sentence><sentence id="184">Because I was a young boy, we figured they are going to get the man, so we spoke to one of those " and we worked out some kind of deal <span class="NPIP">within</span> and my father left.</sentence><sentence id="185">It must have been the end of June and on July 16th my father was gone.</sentence><sentence id="186">So, it was my older sister we went to sleep in a <span class="BUILDING">Christian's home</span> because we were told they were going to pick up the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on the 16th.</sentence><sentence id="187">During the night I heard a lot of noise, and I looked through a <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw the police dragging children, with little bundles.</sentence><sentence id="188">So I saw the French police dragging little kids with their mother, little bundles in the <span class="DLF">street</span> taking them I didn't know where, but I saw them, you know, at night, coming out of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and walking in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> with those French police around them.</sentence><sentence id="189">The mothers crying and I was so shocked, because we were expecting them to pick up men, and they picked up the women and small children, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="190">Lucky for us, we were French citizens.</sentence><sentence id="191">In our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there were a few Jewish families and they were going from one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they must have got a list of maybe not a list.</sentence><sentence id="192">They went from one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to another, and they knocked at my mother's <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">When she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> she had a Jewish star on it and they asked her for some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">identity car</span> and she showed an identity card, she was French.</sentence><sentence id="194">Q. You were talking about the police came in and your mother showed them her identity card.</sentence><sentence id="195">A. Yes, and because on this particular night they didn't pick up French women.</sentence><sentence id="196">This is how we were lucky to survive that particular night.</sentence><sentence id="197">But we decided that we must get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> because today they would find Jews and tomorrow maybe it would be us.</sentence><sentence id="198">So, what we did was we tried to get into contact with a man who helped my father go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, but he disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="199">Either he was caught or he wouldn't do it anymore, but we had an idea of what it took to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">So, we decided and my mother and my two little sisters would go first because if we all disappeared in one shot or whatever, it will be too visible.</sentence><sentence id="201">So we planned it that they were going to go on a vacation and my older sister would stay, but we closed up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> as best we could after they are gone.</sentence><sentence id="202">So, they left, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I don't</sentence><sentence id="204">remember the name a few miles to the <span class="DLF">identification line</span>, and they got to that small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and the next morning they started to walk.</sentence><sentence id="205">They were a couple miles from what was supposed to be the free zone, and they were walking early in the morning and a Frenchman came by with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">He looked at them and he knew the way they looked that they were not from the <span class="REGION">region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">So, the walk was leading right to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> so he asked my mother if she wanted him to take the two kids on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and put it on the hood.</sentence><sentence id="208">My little sister was three years old and the other one was seven, eight years old and they couldn't walk that well.</sentence><sentence id="209">So, she really didn't feel like it, but she accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="210">And she found the fellow with the two children a couple miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> waiting for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="211">Because he wasn't going to cross over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">So, he said walk over a little bit over there and the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> you see will be in the free zone.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, they got to a <span class="DLF">field</span> and saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my mother told my sisters start running and don't stop until you get over there.</sentence><sentence id="214">And this is what they did.</sentence><sentence id="215">My little sister was so small that they just cut the wheat, they cut it so they had the little stump left so it was catching up her little pants, so my sister grabbed her and ran with her.</sentence><sentence id="216">All of a sudden my mother a patrol, a German patrol came by and stopped my mother and they already had two women, Frenchwomen arrested there because some Christians were also trying to get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to see their family.</sentence><sentence id="217">And to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> you needed a special pass and something, so they arrested those two women, and that German soldier got my mother and said what are you doing.</sentence><sentence id="218">She's says I'm on vacation.</sentence><sentence id="219">And she said my children are running in the <span class="DLF">field</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="220">I want my children.</sentence><sentence id="221">I want to get them.</sentence><sentence id="222">So he said show me what you have in your pocketbook.</sentence><sentence id="223">She opened up her pocketbook and what she had was a piece of paper from a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was .</sentence><sentence id="224">The little French she knew he could understand sick children, <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for sick children.</sentence><sentence id="225">She said, see my children are sick, on vacation, so I don't think he was avery hard man.</sentence><sentence id="226">He said go ahead and get your children and come right back.</sentence><sentence id="227">So, she was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="228">She went to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">Q. Did you mother wear the Jewish star?</sentence><sentence id="232">A. In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> yes, but when she left she did not wear it because she knew she couldn't be Jewish to go over there.</sentence><sentence id="233">A few days later it was my turn to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">So, what we did with my sister we packed what we could, big bundles and boarded this <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to be shipped to <span class="REGION">South France</span> where my father already was.</sentence><sentence id="235">Q. You had gotten communication from him?A. Yes, we got letters.</sentence><sentence id="236">So, we thought with my sister to go the same route.</sentence><sentence id="237">It was the only <span class="DLF">route</span> we knew.</sentence><sentence id="238">We were very lucky because we got to that small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">I don't remember the name and we spent the night -- I don't remember if it was a <span class="BUILDING">motel</span> or whatever -- and 5:00 in the morning we left, we walked.</sentence><sentence id="240">We heard motor cycle patrols, and so when we heard it we got out of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and went to the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">We turned down so much that we didn't know what the <span class="NPIP">free side</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="242">So, I told my sister I saw somebody in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, I told my sister you stay right here and I'm going to run over and ask him where am I. So, I ran over and I asked him and he said you are standing right here on the free zone.</sentence><sentence id="243">So, I waved my sister and she came on in and we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, the French asked us what are we doing here.</sentence><sentence id="244">We said we are Jews and we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">But being French citizens, he couldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="246">This particular guy couldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="247">So, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and changing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and all this it took us about seven or eight hours until we got to , and we find my father there.</sentence><sentence id="248">Q. Let me just ask you a question.</sentence><sentence id="249">When you were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together after your father left, how did you make decisions?</sentence><sentence id="250">Did you as the boy, even though you were very young, feel responsible?A. Always and I stayed the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="251">My father was a wonderful man, but he was an easy going man.</sentence><sentence id="252">He wasn't making an important decision didn't come easy to him.</sentence><sentence id="253">I being young I didn't have the vision that he had for me making a decision was easy.</sentence><sentence id="254">I started to make decision in -- I started with my father -- I pushed him to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and from this day on I kept making decisions to this day.</sentence><sentence id="255">All of a sudden I wasn't anymore a child, I was responsible for what was my family.</sentence><sentence id="256">This is the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="257">I never had</sentence><sentence id="259">0 a childhood.</sentence><sentence id="260">I was a man in 24 hours.</sentence><sentence id="261">We got, like I said, we got into , and we started the best we could.</sentence><sentence id="262">My father found a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, two room apartment with six people.</sentence><sentence id="263">So, at night we were opening the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and in the morning we were closing them.</sentence><sentence id="264">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">But the hardest part was finding food.</sentence><sentence id="266">Because we didn't know anybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of .</sentence><sentence id="267">People knew each other.</sentence><sentence id="268">They were born that way.</sentence><sentence id="269">They had a way of getting food more or less at no price.</sentence><sentence id="270">We had to buy everything on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">We were not rich people.</sentence><sentence id="272">Q. You couldn't just go to a local store?A. You needed the coupons.</sentence><sentence id="273">You needed the food rations.</sentence><sentence id="274">You couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="275">So what you could buy was nothing without coupons.</sentence><sentence id="276">Everything else was <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, and we didn't have any contact.</sentence><sentence id="277">Q. And the coupons that you had would have been from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were different?A. No, no, we registered through the department that was taking care of that.</sentence><sentence id="278">We were getting so many coupons for the months.</sentence><sentence id="279">And it was very hard because it was so hard as my sister was about seven or eight years old.</sentence><sentence id="280">We had to pick her up in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she was fainting from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="281">It was tough.</sentence><sentence id="282">Later on we met some contacts and we knew a little bit more so we could get some kind of food, but in the beginning it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="283">It was not only us, it must have been quite a few people that ran away from the <span class="REGION">northern part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">I'm sure it wasn't easy for the local people, but it was a little bit easier than us because they knew how to get stuff.</sentence><sentence id="285">So, it was like that until I don't remember exactly when the German army came in.</sentence><sentence id="286">It wasn't too long, but a lot of people went to , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>, the eastern side of <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> because it was occupied by Italians, the Italian Army.</sentence><sentence id="287">the Italians were not bad.</sentence><sentence id="288">For instance, they were not the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="289">They didn't have the hatred against the Jews that the Germans had.</sentence><sentence id="290">So what we did in we had to go somewhere, go where the Italians are.</sentence><sentence id="291">And also, a lot of people were trying to go to that eastern part of <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> because from there some tried to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">Some were lucky enough and some of them were rejected by the police army or custom.</sentence><sentence id="293">But when the Germans decided it was time, all of a sudden they invaded the rest of</sentence><sentence id="295">1 <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I am sure they were very unhappy with the Italians who were not tough enough with us.</sentence><sentence id="296">So, then after a little while when I was in , | met somebody that I knew who asked me if I wanted to do some work for the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="297">Q. This was when?A. It was in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="298">So, I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="299">And we started through there and people who were deporting were not going to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="300">They were ready to work, like we heard about work because the Germans all of a sudden I think in 1940 they asked for a French man to go and work for them to build the <span class="DLF">Atlantic wall</span> and things like that so working for the Germans was something the Germans were looking for because their men were in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="301">So, for a little while we had the illusion that they were taking people to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">But in 1943 we heard stories that they were deporting Jews to kill them.</sentence><sentence id="303">This was in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="304">It's not like people were saying we never knew.</sentence><sentence id="305">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they didn't know they were killing Jews.</sentence><sentence id="306">We knew already in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="307">What date, I don't remember what we were told they were deporting Jews and killing them.</sentence><sentence id="308">How they were killing them we didn't know, but the objective was to get rid of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="309">So, this is why it makes me feel I must do something.</sentence><sentence id="310">And, I was 16 or 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="311">I don't think of I was really conscious of the danger.</sentence><sentence id="312">To me, now, if somebody would say I was talking easy the two men I already had in mind would never get me alive over there, and I meant it.</sentence><sentence id="313">To me that you know was not something I could be scared of.</sentence><sentence id="314">It was part of the time.</sentence><sentence id="315">Now, I'll be careful on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">I don't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> too often, but in those days this was the age when I wasn't afraid.</sentence><sentence id="317">They asked me, so they asked me if I wanted to go in and try to collect some money and help people who will go by the city of to find them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> safe to stay and if I wanted to do some counter propaganda the German and Vishi government was doing.</sentence><sentence id="318">Because you saw quite often in the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> big posters with the face of a man who looked unshaved and things like that, and they were saying those are the terrorists who are doing this and this and this.</sentence><sentence id="319">Putting bombs and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="320">Usually they were Jewish names or Spanish names.</sentence><sentence id="321">The poster was saying the trouble we have in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> are not the French people, a bunch of foreigners who are the terrorists.</sentence><sentence id="322">Those are the people, and usually those</sentence><sentence id="324">2 people were people who already shot or hanged.</sentence><sentence id="325">So, they asked me we have to do something to counter propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="326">So, what they were doing they were buying these tickets with one sentence, "Die for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>."</sentence><sentence id="327">They asked me to go to every post I could and put the sticker on.</sentence><sentence id="328">We usually were working two fellows.</sentence><sentence id="329">One watching and one putting the sticker and vice versa.</sentence><sentence id="330">One day, I was supposed to meet somebody, somebody was going to work with me and he was going to bring me the sticker.</sentence><sentence id="331">Somebody was going to bring him the stickers.</sentence><sentence id="332">I went to the point.</sentence><sentence id="333">He wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="334">I waited, waited.</sentence><sentence id="335">He wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="336">So, I went to him and going on I saw my sister coming in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">I asked her what are you doing here you're supposed to be at a movie.</sentence><sentence id="338">She said, oh when we got to the movie you know there was <span class="DLF">line</span> and we didn't want to wait.</sentence><sentence id="339">She started to give me some kind of story, but I knew her.</sentence><sentence id="340">I looked at her and all of a sudden I said, I noticed she had a package under her arm.</sentence><sentence id="341">I said what do you have there?</sentence><sentence id="342">She said nothing.</sentence><sentence id="343">Nothing, I said show me.</sentence><sentence id="344">She was a year and a half older than I was, but I was still the boy of the family.</sentence><sentence id="345">I said show me.</sentence><sentence id="346">And I saw the stickers.</sentence><sentence id="347">She was supposed to go to work with somebody else who didn't show up also.</sentence><sentence id="348">She had a sticker and this is all around and my sister was working for the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="349">So, when I saw the sticker I said as long as you have the sticker let's go.</sentence><sentence id="350">So, it was even easier with her than with the fellow I was working with, because with her I was pushing her against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> where the sticker was and I was making believe the I was kissing her and was putting the sticker right in her back.</sentence><sentence id="351">And in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> you know, of course I don't know if it is now, but seeing a couple against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> kissing was not something unusual.</sentence><sentence id="352">So, it made it easier.</sentence><sentence id="353">I was surprised that my sister was doing this because she never told me, and I never told her either.</sentence><sentence id="354">Q. So your parents didn't know you were involved in the resistance?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="355">They would have been scared.</sentence><sentence id="356">Like I said, I wouldn't talk to my sister either because I really didn't want her to be involved.</sentence><sentence id="357">Once we knew I never worked again with her, but I knew she had her own job.</sentence><sentence id="358">Q. Did you talk about your work to her?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="361">3 Q. Not at all?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="362">Because we really didn't know what our work was going to be.</sentence><sentence id="363">I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="364">Sometime I was getting some money I was getting it to somebody else who was going to collect it.</sentence><sentence id="365">Sometimes I was getting some small arms.</sentence><sentence id="366">Sometime I was getting a little bundle with false i.d.s, you know because the printers were printing false i.d.s or they were stealing them when they were making identification cards for the police department and keeping part of it, but we took it to somebody else who was using it to make something else.</sentence><sentence id="367">I was sometime getting some stamps from different police departments.</sentence><sentence id="368">All this, I was some kind of point where people bring something to me and I was giving it to somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="369">The only thing I kept after a while was a handgun.</sentence><sentence id="370">And they didn't mind, and I never knew who was going to show us.</sentence><sentence id="371">We had some way of knowing when somebody, but I didn't know who.</sentence><sentence id="372">For instance, we had somebody coming and telling me we had some training.</sentence><sentence id="373">Some small arm use, some kind of what would happen if we were fighting in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we were getting some kind of training, not much, but some kind of training, and the training we were getting usually there is an <span class="DLF">avenue</span> there is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> goes there and this particular part of is some kind of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> and that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> which was very quiet where we could go two or three fellows we're going to start there and talk.</sentence><sentence id="374">We couldn't use any arms, but we could dismantle the things like that.</sentence><sentence id="375">This is where we were getting this training during the occupation.</sentence><sentence id="376">I never asked them where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="377">If they were from a Jewish underground or a communist underground.</sentence><sentence id="378">It was never part of my mind.</sentence><sentence id="379">They were part of the resistance and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="380">The only thing I had in mind was resistance against the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="381">Q. So you never joined one resistance group or another?A. No, I found out really just before the Russians, the people were doing and I was part of the FFI.</sentence><sentence id="382">We never talked about politics.</sentence><sentence id="383">We never talked about religion.</sentence><sentence id="384">We were there to help and do what we could do.</sentence><sentence id="385">We'll help without a Jew going by who needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay or a ration card, but it didn't make any difference to us.</sentence><sentence id="386">Q. Did you know who your leaders were?</sentence><sentence id="389">4 A. No, I never knew.</sentence><sentence id="390">Q. Did you know how large the organization?A. No, never knew.</sentence><sentence id="391">After the war, I found out it was pretty large.</sentence><sentence id="392">There were only small groups, because you know if they would have caught us, we couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="393">Like I say, I knew a few people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="394">They were coming and talking to me and asking me if I could do that and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="395">But I never knew that Gold was the leader.</sentence><sentence id="396">I didn't know the .</sentence><sentence id="397">It didn't make any difference to me anyway.</sentence><sentence id="398">I was just resisting the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="399">And in 1943, I think it was in 1943, I don't know what month, it got pretty bad also and the people from the resistance, the people I spoke to said listen we have to try to save the children.</sentence><sentence id="403">5 Tape 2 Q. I think you were talking about -- A. I think I was starting to say in 1943, the people I knew in the resistance told us it is becoming harder for the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> so what we are to try to do is to save the children.</sentence><sentence id="404">So, they asked me and I asked my parents if it's okay to have them take the little children and give it to somebody in the resistance who is going to place them somewhere where they are going to be safe.</sentence><sentence id="405">It was very hard for my parents.</sentence><sentence id="406">For me, I said sure, they're going to be safe, why not?But for my parents this was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="407">My little sister was three years old.</sentence><sentence id="408">The other one nine.</sentence><sentence id="409">We talked about and we said we might have a chance to survive, but why not give them a chance.</sentence><sentence id="410">So, what we accepted the offer from the resistance and one day a woman, if I remember well, an Italian Frenchwoman came down and she says I'm going to take them and we wanted to be safe and also it was with one of my sisters fainting from hunger we decided it would be a good idea.</sentence><sentence id="411">We tried to teach my little sister, three years old to call that woman Mommy.</sentence><sentence id="412">The older one it was easy.</sentence><sentence id="413">Before they left my mother sewed in | think in their lining, in the bottom of her skirt a piece of paper with the name and the address of my uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">We told my older sister, the nine year old.</sentence><sentence id="415">We told her if the war stopped and we're not around, get in contact with your uncle.</sentence><sentence id="416">And they left.</sentence><sentence id="417">We didn't know where they were.</sentence><sentence id="418">Q. Your parents must have been -- A. I'm a father myself so I can imagine how tough it was for them.</sentence><sentence id="419">So even without any children you can imagine how it is to give away, giving those two little children up not knowing where they were.</sentence><sentence id="420">Because it was always the same story, life in the resistance we didn't know too many people because in case we were caught, the same thing with that.</sentence><sentence id="421">We couldn't know where they were because if something would happen to us, we couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="422">So, this is what we did.</sentence><sentence id="423">We found out later on they were taken to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the mountains of , and I think the name was .</sentence><sentence id="424">That particular <span class="REGION">region</span> , and I had the feeling I was told the farmers that there were young</sentence><sentence id="426">6 children from the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> undernourished and they are here to get better food, better <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="427">But I don't think we fooled them.</sentence><sentence id="428">They didn't say anything and never mentioned anything and never took my sisters to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="429">They took them to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but they never took them to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">So, I already had the feeling that they knew what they were dealing with.</sentence><sentence id="431">And they were safe like that until liberation.</sentence><sentence id="432">And I was told where they were and I went there to pick them up.</sentence><sentence id="433">Q. By the resistance?A. What?Q. The resistance then told you where they were?A. Oh, yes, they were the only ones who knew.</sentence><sentence id="434">Q. But you didn't know who the resistance was?A. But the people we were dealing with, they got in contact.</sentence><sentence id="435">We were in contact in end we were in contact almost every day with different people in our little group.</sentence><sentence id="436">And one of them knew somebody who knew where they took them.</sentence><sentence id="437">Q. Did you initiate that or did certain people come to you and say do you want us to save your sisters?A. No, they give us that option.</sentence><sentence id="438">I didn't know that option existed.</sentence><sentence id="439">I couldn't go to somebody and say what can you do for my sisters or even for myself.</sentence><sentence id="440">They came to us and told us there is a way to save the children if something should happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="441">Q. What did they think -- what was the idea that might happen to you?A. Being caught by the Germans and be deported, being killed.</sentence><sentence id="442">For instance, my sisters, okay, they were saved.</sentence><sentence id="443">They were safer over there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, but we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="444">And I don't remember the date, but they started to pick up the Jews of .</sentence><sentence id="445">So, now we had the problem what to do.</sentence><sentence id="446">For me it was easier.</sentence><sentence id="447">I was a young fellow, so I could find <span class="NPIP">places</span> that were safe where I could sleep, I could stay.</sentence><sentence id="448">But my sister was a bit older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="449">Her being a girl she couldn't sleep like that.</sentence><sentence id="450">Once in a while I slept <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, because you know a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>, I didn't have any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">The first thing, when we had a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>, it was my parents.</sentence><sentence id="452">So, the resistance again, somebody from the resistance I was talking to told us there is a way we</sentence><sentence id="454">7 can help, having my sister go into a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">This was already at the end of 1943, or the beginning of "44.</sentence><sentence id="456">We said okay.</sentence><sentence id="457">So, they talked to the Mother Superior and she accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="458">So, my sister went into a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="459">But you know all the sisters, everybody was going to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> except my sister, so you know when they were asking they never tried to convert her.</sentence><sentence id="460">They never tried to put any question on her, and the only one who really knew for sure was the Mother Superior and one other sister said why doesn't she go so the Mother Superior told one day I will tell you.</sentence><sentence id="461">But it never bothered her not going to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">I think they figured it out by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="463">Q. I'm surprised that she didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> just in case somebody else would find out.</sentence><sentence id="464">A. No, because she was in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">She was not <span class="NPIP">outside</span> going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="466">Q. But couldn't the Germans come in even to the convent?A. They could but they never did it.</sentence><sentence id="467">They never did that.</sentence><sentence id="468">Q. So, your sister was placed in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, and you and your parents were still at large?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="469">Q. What did you do every day?A. What I found -- I found a job.</sentence><sentence id="470">I had a little training as an office machine mechanic.</sentence><sentence id="471">I went to a small business who was dealing in that kind of machines, calculators and that type and so on and so forth, and I told him I had some small training, can he use me.</sentence><sentence id="472">So, the first thing he did was call in the labor department to find out if he could hire a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="473">Because I never hidden -- when I really had to deal with people, I didn't volunteer but I never hidden.</sentence><sentence id="474">And also, the question was what are you doing with your accent, your Parisian accent here?</sentence><sentence id="475">So, I told them the truth.</sentence><sentence id="476">I left over there because I'm a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="477">So, I had a job.</sentence><sentence id="478">My father being a watchmaker, jeweler, he was working for different <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, going there and doing some repairs.</sentence><sentence id="479">So, this is how we were making a living.</sentence><sentence id="480">Q. In between you were trying to help the resistance?A. Oh, yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="481">Somebody in the resistance knew we existed so when somebody needed some help going by , they had our name.</sentence><sentence id="482">We helped them either if we could get them some false i.d.s or if we could get them some ration cards, or we find them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="485">8 They were going to wherever they wanted to go, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, or wherever they were trying to reach.</sentence><sentence id="486">Q. When you say we, you're just talking about you and a few others?A. Few, everybody I knew, and I'm sure what I was doing must have been repeated by the group.</sentence><sentence id="487">Q. Did you have, I know you didn't know who your overall leaders were but was there one person who supervised you or told you what to do?A. There was one guy seemed to have more information that we did.</sentence><sentence id="488">He was telling us, he was telling assignment tomorrow somebody is going to be you know.</sentence><sentence id="489">He was between us and somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="490">He knew while we were talking about maybe leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and maybe going up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to the Marque to join you know a lot of groups of different men who were fighting more or less organized with a heavy weapon.</sentence><sentence id="491">Weapons they were getting from either dropped by the Allies or stolen from different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but they decided to keep us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">They needed us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so we never went really to join those people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">Q. Was that something you wanted to do?A. I was going to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="494">I was going to anything as long as it was fighting against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="495">| don't think I was thinking too clearly, but sometimes I was sticking my neck out where I shouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="496">All of a sudden while I was working in the little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> over there, a young German soldier came in with his gun, with everything, and he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and he asked my boss if he could use the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to repair the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">So, my boss was not going to refuse him.</sentence><sentence id="498">He said, sure.</sentence><sentence id="499">So, that younger fellow who we give him a place on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and he started to look at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and he couldn't communicate in French, but my Yiddish came back.</sentence><sentence id="500">You know, so I started to say a few words of Yiddish and he understood some of it and I understood some of his Germans.</sentence><sentence id="501">So we got a little bit friendlier and he told me story.</sentence><sentence id="502">He was a young fellow.</sentence><sentence id="503">He must have been 18 or 19 years old and he was from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> it was already turning bad for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="504">So, in that <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> we had a map of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and we were pointing every day the advance of the Allied army in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">He was looking at it.</sentence><sentence id="506">One day I told</sentence><sentence id="508">9 him I said they are going to be there very soon.</sentence><sentence id="509">I said what are you going to do?</sentence><sentence id="510">He said I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="511">They might send me , might send me somewhere, some <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">I said why don't they keep quiet and stay somewhere here, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">It came out of my mind without even thinking.</sentence><sentence id="514">He was a nice fellow he said I wish I could.</sentence><sentence id="515">I will always remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="516">His name was , something like that, but I stuck my neck out really without thinking.</sentence><sentence id="517">So, that gives you an idea of my state of mind.</sentence><sentence id="518">I wasn't afraid because of the age or whatever it was at the time.</sentence><sentence id="519">You couldn't really be afraid.</sentence><sentence id="520">When it came to finding <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>, this must have been in somewhere in the beginning of 1944 just before the landing of the Allies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and thinking about landing in <span class="REGION">South France</span>, they started bombing.</sentence><sentence id="521">They were bombing a lot because it was a railroad turnaround, and by coincidence, it was almost in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="522">But they were bombing almost halfway there like clockwork.</sentence><sentence id="523">What they did, the government of , the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of the French pope was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> about four or five foot thick.</sentence><sentence id="524">They opened it up and we could stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and sleep <span class="NPIP">inside</span> in those <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> because of bombings.</sentence><sentence id="525">So, for me it was beautiful because a lot of French people were going there to avoid the bombing before me.</sentence><sentence id="526">It was somewhere without really to hide.</sentence><sentence id="527">Also, it got to the point where we got so used to the bombing so sometime we were looking if I was with a friend, we were looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming over and we were already figuring if they were released now, the Germans had this from somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="528">But you know being afraid now, it's amazing how you lose fear.</sentence><sentence id="529">It's part of the daily routine and we were watching them and first the Red Cross for some kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> or whatever after the bombs were coming down.</sentence><sentence id="530">Also, they asked me -- and also the French government was kind to ask us, if anybody to help the people after the bombing, because sometime a lot of the people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="531">So, we had to go there and try to dig them out, but everytime we heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> coming, a lot of people were cursing.</sentence><sentence id="532">We were happy because while the bombs were falling, they didn't worry about us.</sentence><sentence id="533">For us, everytime we saw those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming it was a closer day to liberation.</sentence><sentence id="534">Sure, we could have been killed but for us it was a relief.</sentence><sentence id="535">We knew it was stopping the Germans and of getting us.</sentence><sentence id="536">So, you know it was a very strange atmosphere in those days.</sentence><sentence id="539">0 Q. Did you get information from <span class="NPIP">outside of</span> ?</sentence><sentence id="540">Did you get a radio broadcast or?A. We were listening to all those ears, the information we were getting was from the BBC.</sentence><sentence id="541">I don't remember exactly at what hour, but we made it our business to listen.</sentence><sentence id="542">This was all the information we got because everything else we got from the French government were lies.</sentence><sentence id="543">But the <span class="BUILDING">BBC</span> was the <span class="DLF">life line</span> to the news.</sentence><sentence id="544">Q. Back to this resistance organization that you were involved in.</sentence><sentence id="545">I know you said you didn't know too much about the organization, but what can you tell me in more detail the sorts of things you did for them and how you got what you got and where you took it and that sort of thing?A. Usually, you know it might not be very dramatic, usually I was collecting stuff from people.</sentence><sentence id="546">Q. From what people?A. Other people from the resistance who were bringing me a package with for instance, small arms, or a package of propaganda material or a package of ration cards, something like that was brought to me.</sentence><sentence id="547">And somebody else was picking it up from me.</sentence><sentence id="548">See, this was a thing.</sentence><sentence id="549">I didn't do anything heroic, you know, but it was part of my job.</sentence><sentence id="550">And also, about close to the end before the liberation all of a sudden so many <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were blown up.</sentence><sentence id="551">So much sabotage was done, all of a sudden the Germans had a bright idea of saying that all men and I don't remember from what age must report every night and watch the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> and put our men every 50 meters, every 100 meters.</sentence><sentence id="552">And you must go there and if something should happen, you're responsible.</sentence><sentence id="553">So, I think I was too young.</sentence><sentence id="554">My father was called.</sentence><sentence id="555">That's when I said to my father, it's crazy.</sentence><sentence id="556">First of all, some of my groups are going to blow it up anyway, and how can you be responsible for something like that.</sentence><sentence id="557">You're already hiding so don't go.</sentence><sentence id="558">What are they going to do?</sentence><sentence id="559">There's nothing they can do, you know, you are not there.</sentence><sentence id="560">Q. So your father, at this point, knew you were involved with the resistance?</sentence><sentence id="563">1 A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="564">At that point he knew it.</sentence><sentence id="565">He knew it from the moment we spoke about sending away my sisters.</sentence><sentence id="566">Then he knew.</sentence><sentence id="567">So, it didn't go watch those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and a lot of other things happened and we by the end were told to watch anything going on.</sentence><sentence id="568">If there is any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> organized with people in it, to make sure that those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would not go through.</sentence><sentence id="569">This was our job so I hate to see anything going on, something different in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="570">We were watching to see if the Germans were not moving too much, and little by little we say them disappearing, because we didn't have any big fighter on there.</sentence><sentence id="571">You see, when they came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the first time when I saw them, in the <span class="DLF">street</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, where you saw young guys must have been in their 20s, strong young guy, when they left, what do you see, old men pushing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> with their belongings in it walking.</sentence><sentence id="572">A young kid maybe 14 of 15 years old because they must have used the army somewhere in a different <span class="NPIP">front</span> before the occupation they took anything.</sentence><sentence id="573">You know, what a difference between an army and a retreat.</sentence><sentence id="574">So we saw them but we didn't see any big fight.</sentence><sentence id="575">Q. Was there a pretty large German presence?A. For a little while, yes.</sentence><sentence id="576">For a little while they were all there.</sentence><sentence id="577">Every time we turned around there was a German there.</sentence><sentence id="578">Q. And Vichy police as well?A. Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="579">Not only the Vichy police but we had different kinds of police.</sentence><sentence id="580">You had the police of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, you had the with the Nationals and it was part of it the munitions.</sentence><sentence id="581">Those were the worst collaborators there is.</sentence><sentence id="582">They were the ones doing the dirty job.</sentence><sentence id="583">You know they were working with the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="584">So, we had to be careful of a lot of different organizations.</sentence><sentence id="585">Q. Did you see when you were living in the south Jews being taken away or people being beaten or any of that sort of thing?A. Beaten in front of me, no, but being grabbed and thrown into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and taken away, yes.</sentence><sentence id="586">This I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="587">I saw it quite a few times.</sentence><sentence id="588">You know, because sometimes walking the <span class="DLF">street</span>, all of</sentence><sentence id="590">2 a sudden they were asking for identification paper, and the ones who didn't have the right kind they were grabbing them and throwing them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and taking them away.</sentence><sentence id="591">Q. Did you feel that you had any real close calls?A. Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="592">Yes, I had a very close call.</sentence><sentence id="593">I was working with a fellow, and he had some propaganda stuff he was supposed to give me.</sentence><sentence id="594">What he did, he did something very, very stupid.</sentence><sentence id="595">He picked it up from somewhere, I don't remember where and he had it on his back.</sentence><sentence id="596">In those days, you know, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">So, everything was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> and we had what we called <span class="BUILDING">bike garages</span>, and those <span class="BUILDING">bike garages</span> were in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> inside of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">So, he says I'll wait over there and I will give it to you.</sentence><sentence id="599">We walked and I said go ahead and pick up your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and I was waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">As soon as he got in, I saw them, either the police or the Gestapo and they grabbed him.</sentence><sentence id="601">When I saw them, the only thing I could do was turn around.</sentence><sentence id="602">They called me, but I wasn't going to stop for them, so it was a very close call.</sentence><sentence id="603">Another time I had another friend, he was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="604">Because in that particular <span class="NPIP">day</span> they picked up a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="605">In that particular night they were arresting quite a few young people, Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="606">And that friend of mine that was Jewish also was part of the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="607">He wasn't exactly what a German would have thought a Jew looked like.</sentence><sentence id="608">He was blonde, blue eyes.</sentence><sentence id="609">When they arrested him, in the meantime they put him in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and the next morning the Gestapo was coming or the ammunition or whatever, and the same night another fellow I knew, wasn't Jewish was arrested also, and he told me the story.</sentence><sentence id="610">I wouldn't have believed it.</sentence><sentence id="611">What they did, they arrested so many young fellows they put them in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with a very big <span class="DLF">door</span> with a big padlock.</sentence><sentence id="612">My friend was a small little fellow.</sentence><sentence id="613">He must have been maybe 5'5" or 5'6" and he went to that padlock.</sentence><sentence id="614">He must have been so desperate, he bolted and he run away, and other guys run away too.</sentence><sentence id="615">The other fellow I knew --- Q. You were talking about ?</sentence><sentence id="616">A. This fellow told me he saw it with his own eyes, a little guy like that breaking a big padlock like that.</sentence><sentence id="617">He wouldn't have believed it.</sentence><sentence id="618">And they all ran away.</sentence><sentence id="619">Because you see, he knew, he knew the next morning the Gestapo or whoever was going to interrogate him and ask</sentence><sentence id="621">3 him and even with all this false paper, they would ask him to drop his pants down.</sentence><sentence id="622">And you know in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, nobody was circumcised that was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="623">So, he must have been so desperate that he did it.</sentence><sentence id="624">This is how the things were with the young people.</sentence><sentence id="625">We knew how bad it was for us to be caught and be deported.</sentence><sentence id="626">Q. Had you thought about going into real hiding?A. Never.</sentence><sentence id="627">Q. Why?A. I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="628">It wasn't in me.</sentence><sentence id="629">The only thing I thought was if they wanted me to go to the .</sentence><sentence id="630">Iwas ready for that.</sentence><sentence id="631">But going into hiding, no.</sentence><sentence id="632">It was amazing.</sentence><sentence id="633">You see like I say it was very hard to communicate this but I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">I always felt completely free.</sentence><sentence id="635">Nobody is going to tell me really what to do.</sentence><sentence id="636">You see, maybe certain people came from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, you know, like my father told me, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> sometime you know when they saw a soldier you know they would get off the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> because they were afraid somebody was going to hit them.</sentence><sentence id="637">They knew more about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">pogrom</span> than I did.</sentence><sentence id="638">I never saw a pogrom in my life.</sentence><sentence id="639">So this is what to me I think and it never went to my mind.</sentence><sentence id="640">I was hiding to avoid being taken by the Germans but trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> somewhere in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> or whatever, it wasn't in me.</sentence><sentence id="641">Q. Or to pretend you were catholic?A. I never did that.</sentence><sentence id="642">Even when I was in the army, they send me an , SO one day, I will always remember, we went to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> somewhere around , and the captain all of a sudden got the idea of everybody is going to go on Sunday to mass.</sentence><sentence id="643">We had to get up early and we all go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">I got up like anybody else but when we got to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> they all got in and you know kneel and cross themselves, I stayed at the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="645">They asked me why don't you go in.</sentence><sentence id="646">I said I don't mind going in, but I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="647">I never volunteered.</sentence><sentence id="648">I never told them, they never asked me, but when it came the time to say it, I said it.</sentence><sentence id="649">They were all surprised because I was the only Jew in the whole unit.</sentence><sentence id="650">It never came to</sentence><sentence id="652">4 their mind that I could be different than they were as far as religion.</sentence><sentence id="653">During the war, it was the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="654">If I felt like I mentioned before, if I applied for a job, I didn't write I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="655">Q. Why not, wouldn't it have been easier?A. It would have been a lie.</sentence><sentence id="656">It wouldn't have been helpful.</sentence><sentence id="657">Because you see I was a Parisian with a different accent.</sentence><sentence id="658">What was I doing in .</sentence><sentence id="659">You see?</sentence><sentence id="660">So, I told them that there was no law against hiring a Jew and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="661">Maybe I wasn't smart.</sentence><sentence id="662">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="663">But I never did hide it.</sentence><sentence id="664">I didn't hide it in the army.</sentence><sentence id="665">I didn't hide it anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="666">The only thing I was hiding it when I had false papers.</sentence><sentence id="667">Q. Now, what did you get the false papers for?</sentence><sentence id="668">What did you need the false papers?A. For the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="669">For instance, they were stopping the people the in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and asking for identity card and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> everybody has an identity card.</sentence><sentence id="670">So, the police a lot of times stopped you and asked you for an identity card.</sentence><sentence id="671">So, then I had a false identity.</sentence><sentence id="672">Sure, I wasn't telling them I was Jewish when I was showing them my identity card.</sentence><sentence id="673">If not, there was no reason.</sentence><sentence id="674">Q. Why wouldn't you use that same card for the man who was going to hire you or anything else?A. You see, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I was missing something.</sentence><sentence id="675">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for a young fellow, I don't know how it is now, you needed a permit for a young man to go to work, and I didn't have that permit.[had it only in my name.</sentence><sentence id="676">The permit when I went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="677">My name was Federman on the permit, it was not Richard.</sentence><sentence id="678">So, you know it was more involved, plus we needed the money to survive.</sentence><sentence id="679">I had to get ajob.</sentence><sentence id="680">You know, and where do you find, the resistance never, never offered any, you know, the false permit for children to go to work.</sentence><sentence id="681">So, this must be one of the reasons why I didn't use it.</sentence><sentence id="682">Q. Was it your sense that there were other Jewish members of the resistance --?A. Yes, yes because I knew some fellows that were Jewish, but it was never something you know that important.</sentence><sentence id="683">Our main objective is to resist.</sentence><sentence id="684">That's how it is.</sentence><sentence id="685">We were willing to help anybody who was willing to resist, who was part of our resistance movement.</sentence><sentence id="688">5 Q. There were girls in the movement?A. Yes, my sister.</sentence><sentence id="689">Q. Did the girls have different kinds of jobs than the boys, different types of responsibilities?A. They must have because my sister never got any kind of training about fighting.</sentence><sentence id="690">You know, and it's very hard now when I'm thinking about it, we never talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="691">We never talked about the details about what she was doing and what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="692">It's very hard to explain, but we never talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="693">Like for quite some time we never talked about the details that happened during the war.</sentence><sentence id="694">You know, I start to really talk about is when my kid got older.</sentence><sentence id="695">But it's not , some people, I personally felt had a lot more interesting things to talk about than I did.</sentence><sentence id="696">Some people were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, some people suffered a lot more than I did.</sentence><sentence id="697">Q. Were you aware of the Jewish underground organizations?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="698">Like I told you, we had some contact with the people coming mostly from I'd say who were -- we knew there was some kind of organization, but I knew so few people in .</sentence><sentence id="699">So, it wasn't a problem of trying to find a group where you fit.</sentence><sentence id="700">Sure, if there was a lot of Jews in , I'm sure I would have been with them.</sentence><sentence id="701">But I didn't know enough people.</sentence><sentence id="702">See, so this is why I worked with the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="703">By the end, I found out it was the FFI, but I wouldn't have been surprised if somebody would have told me it was a communist movement or a Jewish movement.</sentence><sentence id="704">Q. So the name of your group was?A. After the war?Q. That you found out?A. , the French Force of the Interior.</sentence><sentence id="705">Like you have the French army <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who were supposed to be <span class="NPIP">inside</span> doing what we could.</sentence><sentence id="706">Some of those forces was a lot more active than we were because they were organized to really fight in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, in the .</sentence><sentence id="707">Some of them were very, very well organized.</sentence><sentence id="708">The resistance from the French railroad.</sentence><sentence id="711">6 Q. These were all separate organizations?A. They were separate organizations.</sentence><sentence id="712">They had contact with other organizations to synchronize some of the work, but everyone was assigned a certain job.</sentence><sentence id="713">Some people were -- it never happened to me-- but some people were specialized in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, allied flyers who were shut down, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">They were specialized in that.</sentence><sentence id="715">They were looking for that.</sentence><sentence id="716">Some had direct contact with , but we didn't have those.</sentence><sentence id="717">I'm sure some of those Jewish underground I had the feeling they had contact with the zionists from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="718">Some were I'm sure were in contact with American Jewish organizations which were very active trying to help the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="719">They were helping a lot more of the foreign refugees than the French, but I'm sure they were there, but we were French, we were not foreigners.</sentence><sentence id="720">So, we had a different way of reacting.</sentence><sentence id="721">Q. So you really didn't know about all of others?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="722">Q. Did you ever feel isolated?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="723">Once I started to work with the resistance, I knew I was not isolated.</sentence><sentence id="724">I knew somebody was trying to do something for us because you know this is why they give us the option of the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="725">I knew what I was doing was helping somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="726">So, I knew I was part of a large group, but my personally I didn't know those people.</sentence><sentence id="727">After the war, then I saw in the dozens of different groups, and more or less we synchronized in doing what we were to do.</sentence><sentence id="728">We were watching to see if the Germans were not doing an sabotage.</sentence><sentence id="729">We were waiting for the Allies to reach us.</sentence><sentence id="730">But the Allies had an easy time because when they reached us, everything was already under control.</sentence><sentence id="731">The first time I saw Americans, I was told go in see where the Americans are.</sentence><sentence id="732">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was already under control of the resistance, but we are told go and give a look.</sentence><sentence id="733">So, I inquired and somebody told me they are somewhere not far from there, and they were a couple miles down the <span class="DLF">road</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I got there and I saw three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">This is the first American I saw.</sentence><sentence id="735">By coincidence one of the tank commanders, the leaders,</sentence><sentence id="737">7 I think it was a lieutenant or whatever, spoke a few words of French, because he didn't know what to expect either.</sentence><sentence id="738">We told him it's open.</sentence><sentence id="739">Q. The Germans had just disappeared?A. They just went away.</sentence><sentence id="740">Q. When was this?</sentence><sentence id="741">Do you remember the date?A. I think summer of "44.</sentence><sentence id="742">They disappeared, and we saw them little by little disappear and like I said we saw them walking, pushing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> with their belongings.</sentence><sentence id="743">We saw them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">We even saw a couple with some kind of small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor boat</span>, you know they must have stole it somewhere going up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> maybe going to .</sentence><sentence id="745">But it was not like a big fight like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="746">They went and that was all there was to it.</sentence><sentence id="747">The only time we worried a little bit was in the winter of "44 "45.</sentence><sentence id="748">We were already liberated and all this and all of a sudden the Battle of the Bulge started.</sentence><sentence id="749">So, we were already talking about what do we do if the German army comes back.</sentence><sentence id="750">But it didn't last that long.</sentence><sentence id="751">Also, the regression we saw a lot of different groups because all of a sudden we were told to look around to see if we can pick up any Germans who stayed behind.</sentence><sentence id="752">So, we got from different people their names and the address of a Frenchwomen who was living with Germans.</sentence><sentence id="753">The Germans were gone, but those women were caught.</sentence><sentence id="754">We were interested and the only thing we did was we left them with their panties on.</sentence><sentence id="755">It didn't make any sense but it was maybe a relief so we dragged them to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">After that, when we saw a woman with a scarf on her head for a few months, we knew what it was.</sentence><sentence id="757">This was a different group again.</sentence><sentence id="758">Sometime we're walking and one <span class="DLF">street</span> was dragging a couple of women and we met in another <span class="DLF">street</span> another group with another couple of women.</sentence><sentence id="759">So, we knew there were different groups working.</sentence><sentence id="760">After that, we were told to help to try and round up the collaborators.</sentence><sentence id="761">So, this is what we did.</sentence><sentence id="762">We went to the French police and they were taken to <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">There was a very fast trial and then we took them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and we shot them down.</sentence><sentence id="764">But it lasted --it didn't last too much.</sentence><sentence id="765">Most of those people were shot were people with a lot of proof of what they did.</sentence><sentence id="766">Even when I was in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> once and their lawyers and I heard the</sentence><sentence id="768">8 lawyer talking and he said no chance of a death sentence and everytime it was that sentence by a couple jurors.</sentence><sentence id="769">This was the atmosphere of that liberation at the time.</sentence><sentence id="770">Q. So, back to the liberation itself.</sentence><sentence id="771">The Germans had disappeared, you heard some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> were nearby.</sentence><sentence id="772">That was it?A. We went there.</sentence><sentence id="773">That was it, and after that, a few days later we saw the Army coming.</sentence><sentence id="774">You know, the regular army.</sentence><sentence id="775">The French army and the American army, and I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="776">I didn't know they existed.</sentence><sentence id="777">I saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris Jewish Brigade</span> going too.</sentence><sentence id="778">All of a sudden, one day I was looking at all those soldiers and what do I see?</sentence><sentence id="779">Jewish guys.</sentence><sentence id="780">You know who were part of the what do you call, the English army, Jewish .</sentence><sentence id="781">I don't know if you ever heard of that?</sentence><sentence id="782">So, this really make me feel real good when I saw those guys.</sentence><sentence id="783">They went through and they kept on going up to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="784">After the liberation, I wanted to go up with the French Army.</sentence><sentence id="785">They looked at me and said what's the matter with you.</sentence><sentence id="786">You are not trained.</sentence><sentence id="787">You are not a soldier.</sentence><sentence id="788">You are somebody from the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="789">You are not a soldier so wait a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="790">I waited a few months and after that I went into the French army and I went up to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I did an occupation the first three years mostly in and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="791">I don't remember , but somewhere I found out there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I never knew the name, and even now I don't know the name of it.</sentence><sentence id="792">Nobody talks about it, but somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, I don't know if it's up over or wherever.</sentence><sentence id="793">One day I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went there and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was already liberated, and I saw the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and all this, but until now I never really made an effort to find out the name of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="794">So, there was a camp right in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, right there.</sentence><sentence id="795">After that, they asked me very nicely to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because we were also -- a fellow like me coming from the resistance and we were not trained with the discipline that a regular soldier is when somebody was looking at us and saying something, you know sometime we were very rough with him, what were you doing in the war.</sentence><sentence id="796">Where were you?</sentence><sentence id="797">We came from the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="798">What were you doing there those four years.</sentence><sentence id="799">So, I think the French government decided to get rid of us.</sentence><sentence id="800">We were not very good soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="801">So, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="802">During the war we lost everything.</sentence><sentence id="803">In 1942, we abandoned</sentence><sentence id="805">9 everything and left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">My father had a small little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">Everything was taken and in , after that we found out that we had hidden in our small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">After that when we tried to go back everything was taken away.</sentence><sentence id="809">So, neighbors told us I don't know if it was true but one day -- maybe it's true.</sentence><sentence id="810">A German army came in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they were looking for us and they emptied all things and they find a statement, so we lost everything around twice, but we were smart enough to put our life more value on our life than our belongings.</sentence><sentence id="811">Some people were caught because they stayed.</sentence><sentence id="812">It's very hard for somebody who worked all his life and see that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, if something should happen, I will take my suitcase and go.</sentence><sentence id="813">I figure you know material things are not important, but for some people they are important.</sentence><sentence id="814">The <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>, they lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for years and years and abandon everything and go, they couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="815">They figure maybe they won't pick us up and they were picked up.</sentence><sentence id="816">This is why a lot of people were picked up.</sentence><sentence id="817">They figured it will not happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="818">I understand now until now I couldn't understand why it would be so hard for people to abandon everything just to save their life and maybe start over again.</sentence><sentence id="819">Q. How did your family get back together again.</sentence><sentence id="820">How did you find everyone?A. The liberation I was told by the people who took them that took my sister, where they were and I went to pick them up.</sentence><sentence id="821">My sister came out of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="822">My mother and father were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so we got back.</sentence><sentence id="823">After that I don't remember what month, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="824">We're talking about taking my father didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="825">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to see what happened to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we were in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">When I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was empty and on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and he was using our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as a storage place for his flour, bags and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="827">And also, I had something good going for us.</sentence><sentence id="828">The French government passed a law immediately anybody who comes back must get their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back.</sentence><sentence id="829">It's not some French people, the Jews were picked up, they moved in.</sentence><sentence id="830">A lot of them are still there because people never came back.</sentence><sentence id="831">So, I asked to give me back the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I asked the baker to please empty the whole thing and we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we bought some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and I went to the army.</sentence><sentence id="834">0 Q. Was the baker resentful?A. I don't know, but he never said anything.</sentence><sentence id="835">He knew the law.</sentence><sentence id="836">He must have been very, very surprised that we came back, because they didn't expect us coming back.</sentence><sentence id="837">For instance, in 1945, we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">Q. And you were in the army?A. No, no.</sentence><sentence id="839">I saw them in the army, but we saw them also in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">They were coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="841">They were liberated and they were coming to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to get some medical help and also to see what they can be relocated.</sentence><sentence id="842">Because a lot of those people were without any nationality.</sentence><sentence id="843">No <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> really recognized them.</sentence><sentence id="844">Some we called them , with no nationality whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="845">So, then I'm sure a lot of American Jews in our organization helped them resettle either in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in those days <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, or bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">Then I heard about the Joint Committee, but we saw them every time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="847">I was making my business when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and see those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming and see what I could do to help those people.</sentence><sentence id="848">A lot of them you saw cadavers.</sentence><sentence id="849">You saw those films.</sentence><sentence id="850">People emaciated, you know, came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">So, a lot of people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they thought they will not come back because they already knew about the killing.</sentence><sentence id="852">They already knew these things, so they were very surprised to see us.</sentence><sentence id="853">Tape 3 Q. You were talking about going and seeing these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> coming with refugees from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what they looked like.</sentence><sentence id="854">A. They looked so bad.</sentence><sentence id="855">They looked so bad.</sentence><sentence id="856">You could see those people were walking skeletons.</sentence><sentence id="857">Some of them couldn't even stand up.</sentence><sentence id="858">So, I was there and I was sometimes helping them get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="859">I was helping.</sentence><sentence id="860">While I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, in</sentence><sentence id="862">1 occupation over there I was in ,and all of a sudden my brother-in-law send me a letter.</sentence><sentence id="863">He says , my brother was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="864">So, he said you are in over there and there is a cousin of ours that is somewhere in the <span class="BUILDING">locating station</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="865">Give a look and see if you can find him.</sentence><sentence id="866">So, I asked around, and I was told that not far from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of they had some kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like that was a Hungarian refugees.</sentence><sentence id="867">So, I went there and saw <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">I saw <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and I saw some families there already together waiting.</sentence><sentence id="869">I had his name and I said do you know so and so.</sentence><sentence id="870">I was asking and finally somebody said if he was single they put them up in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="871">Isaid okay.</sentence><sentence id="872">So, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and I got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I asked her his name.</sentence><sentence id="873">They said, yes, he's here.</sentence><sentence id="874">I said where, what <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>?</sentence><sentence id="875">I went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and after that I realized I did something wrong.</sentence><sentence id="876">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and saw about eight or ten young fellows in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">I walked in and I said who is this and this man.</sentence><sentence id="878">I didn't realize how I presented it.</sentence><sentence id="879">I was in full uniform.</sentence><sentence id="880">So, they got scared.</sentence><sentence id="881">So they pointed to one fellow and they said this is him and they all disappeared and he stayed with me.</sentence><sentence id="882">I said listen, your cousin is my brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="883">In Yiddish I said your cousin is my brother-in-law, and I had to repeat this four or five times until it dawned on me.</sentence><sentence id="884">And I didn't realize you know he was talking to authority.</sentence><sentence id="885">In his eyes, I was in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="886">So, finally when he realized what I was saying, then I said let's go down to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and let's have something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="887">I asked him how he was doing if he needed something.</sentence><sentence id="888">He says he trying to get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but he cannot get a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">I said, let me see what I can do.</sentence><sentence id="890">So, I went to the French representative over there and I said that's my cousin.</sentence><sentence id="891">He came out of some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> over there in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="892">I'm his only family.</sentence><sentence id="893">I want him to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="894">What can you do?</sentence><sentence id="895">The girl was very nice she says I wish I could but I cannot.</sentence><sentence id="896">We cannot give any visas.</sentence><sentence id="897">Visas are coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="898">I cannot give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="899">After that I had a very good buddy of mine in the Army, in the army you usually get one friend who is more of an than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="900">I told him listen.</sentence><sentence id="901">When we are going on furlough to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, the only time they're stopping us is at the <span class="DLF">border</span> before we reach .</sentence><sentence id="902">This is where</sentence><sentence id="904">2 they're stopping us.</sentence><sentence id="905">They're asking us sometime for a pass, but usually any time, I told him what can we do for the guy.</sentence><sentence id="906">Well, we can put a uniform on him and once we are in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, there are a thousand refugees over there.</sentence><sentence id="907">They don't pull them out and since that idea we go on furlough in a couple weeks, we'll take him with us.</sentence><sentence id="908">He can sit between us, he cannot talk because something is wrong with his throat and we'll go on through.</sentence><sentence id="909">We can always borrow a uniform somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="910">We went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="911">I said look we cannot get it legally, but according to what I know once you are in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they don't throw you out, so this is what we can do.</sentence><sentence id="912">He was so scared he wouldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="913">So, after that he waited for about a year, year and a half and he needed a work certificate to get ajob.</sentence><sentence id="914">So, my father who was a little jeweler, said he'll give him a job.</sentence><sentence id="915">So, this is what we tried to do.</sentence><sentence id="916">To help as much as I could.</sentence><sentence id="917">Q. After the war, as a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, did you feel any differently.</sentence><sentence id="918">Did the general reaction change at all or was it the same as before?A. The same as before, and also when I'm thinking about it I was a little bit cocky because you see a lot of people were standing on <span class="DLF">line</span> to see a film you know and I was going right up to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and buying my ticket.</sentence><sentence id="919">When somebody was looking at me and started to say something I say listen I don't have the time, now.</sentence><sentence id="920">I have to go back.</sentence><sentence id="921">I was cocky.</sentence><sentence id="922">So to answer your question, I didn't have any fear.</sentence><sentence id="923">You see the only think I knew I had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="924">I came back, when I was released from the army we didn't have any money and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was in very shape.</sentence><sentence id="925">I didn't see really a future a bright future for somebody like me.</sentence><sentence id="926">No money, nothing, plus you know the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was always a little bit society, you know father and son get business and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="927">So, having and being a Frenchman, was never really .</sentence><sentence id="928">So one day I decided let me go to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and see what I can do here.</sentence><sentence id="929">IfI don't like it, I can always go back.</sentence><sentence id="930">I'm not a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="931">I'm not running away from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because somebody is doing something to me.</sentence><sentence id="932">I'm trying to get a better <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="933">So, I applied and I got my visa pretty fast.</sentence><sentence id="934">I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the I knew some Americans are going to be offended, but the little I know as a mechanic, the little training I got, all of a sudden when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I find out I knew more than the Americans knew.</sentence><sentence id="935">Because you see</sentence><sentence id="937">3 the apprenticeship was more intense than what the Americans were getting.</sentence><sentence id="938">You see, for instance, I was often paid what I worth, so I didn't actually produce.</sentence><sentence id="939">So, I started to work, I think I got less than a week and all of a sudden I discovered what I knew was worth something.</sentence><sentence id="940">So, instead of working for somebody that didn't like the attitude I went from one <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to the other and I started in brokering.</sentence><sentence id="941">Because in brokering it was almost a place where I could communicate very, very little English, some Yiddish, so I could communicate with the customers.</sentence><sentence id="942">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I said listen.</sentence><sentence id="943">I'm a mechanic.</sentence><sentence id="944">I can fix <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>, so they looked at me and we heard that story before.</sentence><sentence id="945">I told them, listen you give them to me, if you don't like it, you don't pay me.</sentence><sentence id="946">That's all there is to it.</sentence><sentence id="947">So, what they did was they went to their <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and pick up any junk nobody wanted to fix, and I fixed it, at a very, very low price.</sentence><sentence id="948">Little by little 1 made enough business man where | could get the work.</sentence><sentence id="949">They were bringing the work at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="950">I was working at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">I had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and I was working at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and my mother and my younger sister came.</sentence><sentence id="952">I had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> prepared for them, and my father and my sister, the middle one stayed with them because the other one got married, because he was going to close and sell whatever his business was.</sentence><sentence id="953">So, I had my mother and my little sister, and I was already making enough to support them.</sentence><sentence id="954">A year later my father came.</sentence><sentence id="955">My father really never worked for anybody either.</sentence><sentence id="956">He was always a little watchmaker in a small little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> making a living as best he could.</sentence><sentence id="957">So, we decided to open a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> because we knew the language.</sentence><sentence id="958">In those days it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="959">This is where the are.</sentence><sentence id="960">In those days it was no liberation.</sentence><sentence id="961">We opened a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="962">Half of it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> and the other half was jewelry and watchmaking.</sentence><sentence id="963">We each went on like that for a couple years.</sentence><sentence id="964">One day I met a beautiful Parisian girl, very Jewish and we decided to get married.</sentence><sentence id="965">My father was a man who was happy what he was.</sentence><sentence id="966">He didn't want too much.</sentence><sentence id="967">But I was frustrated because I wanted a little bit more than that.</sentence><sentence id="968">So, I was trying to do certain things in <span class="BUILDING">business</span> where he was scared.</sentence><sentence id="969">So, one day I told him, "Dad, I love you, but I must go."</sentence><sentence id="970">So, what I did, this was working and what I had in mind was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> is where business is.</sentence><sentence id="971">So, he said I don't know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="972">One day I saw an ad in the paper they were looking</sentence><sentence id="974">4 for an experienced mechanic.</sentence><sentence id="975">So one day I got the job and give me a chance to see what business is really like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">In the meantime, I was going to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and at night after work I was going back to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and taking care of whatever came in.</sentence><sentence id="977">This took a few months and one day I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and I said listen I didn't come in to work for you.</sentence><sentence id="978">I came in to see and his business was already having some difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="979">He didn't have the know how.</sentence><sentence id="980">He was just an accountant.</sentence><sentence id="981">He didn't know the <span class="REGION">technical side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="982">He was depending on all the other people.</sentence><sentence id="983">It didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="984">So, I told him, either I go or I buy my way in.</sentence><sentence id="985">He must have seen the picture he was really in a lot of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="986">I saw that he was in trouble but in my mind I could put it back in place.</sentence><sentence id="987">This is what I did.</sentence><sentence id="988">So, for quite a few years I went back every single day.</sentence><sentence id="989">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, my wife, myself and we had an only child.</sentence><sentence id="990">So, I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and this is what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="991">Sometimes I would start at 5:00 in the morning and finishing at 11:00, 12:00.</sentence><sentence id="992">Saturday and Sunday I was working.</sentence><sentence id="993">This went on for a few years, and one day I told my father, listen, you are hardly making a living now because you never understood the American way of doing business.</sentence><sentence id="994">There is competition.</sentence><sentence id="995">It's not <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="996"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> before the war you bought something for $50 and you sold it with 40 or 50 percent profit.</sentence><sentence id="997">Here you have to watch what the next guy does.</sentence><sentence id="998">If you are not competitive you are never going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="999">So, the merchandise he bought the first day when we left the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, we still had.</sentence><sentence id="1000">He never understood.</sentence><sentence id="1001">So, when I talked to my father I said, listen, you are hardly making a living and I thought about it, thought about and said why don't you come to work with me.</sentence><sentence id="1002">So a son going to work for a father is something acceptable but a father going to work for a son first of all is very hard for a son, because you cannot talk to an employee that's your father, but it had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1003">So, he closed the <span class="BUILDING">business</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and came to work for me until he passed away.</sentence><sentence id="1004">Q. I just have a few questions that related to before you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1005">You younger sisters were hiding with someone?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1006">Q. Your other sister was in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and you were out there at risk?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1009">5 Q. Can you think of ways in which these years changed anything?A. I'm sure it must have changed us.</sentence><sentence id="1010">I cannot pinpoint exactly.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Q. Did you see them come out of that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> different than when they went?A. They were too young to show anything, but I think it did something to them.</sentence><sentence id="1012">I don't know maybe I'm looking too hard on that.</sentence><sentence id="1013">For instance you see Hitler tried to get rid of us, tried to do something to us.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Maybe we are trying to prove he didn't succeed at all.</sentence><sentence id="1015">My little sister, the little one three years old, right now is Professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and is a doctor in Biology.</sentence><sentence id="1016">My other sister graduated <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, maybe this gave us the little push we needed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1017">I don't know if this is an answer to your question.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Q. You don't think you would have those positions in France?A. Maybe yes, maybe no.</sentence><sentence id="1019">Q. What about you?</sentence><sentence id="1020">Did it change your attitude?</sentence><sentence id="1021">Make you stronger?A. In a certain way it made me stronger, you know, and it proved that --I don't want you to take it the wrong way -- it proved something that not too many men in their lives had, the proof that you can sacrifice yourself for somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="1022">I hope nobody is in a position like that, but being at the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and not going over, this proved to myself, I had enough feeling for my family and other people to not have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I said this happened maybe once in a lifetime to a few people.</sentence><sentence id="1024">This is what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And also it put me in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> where I never stayed back.</sentence><sentence id="1026">Some times it's not very smart because you get hit right in the face, but this is the way I am.</sentence><sentence id="1027">Maybe this makes me like that.</sentence><sentence id="1028">When there is a problem, I confront it right away.</sentence><sentence id="1029">For instance, it made me also less care than other people.</sentence><sentence id="1030">I had a couple experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1031">I was sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and a guy walked in and he had his rain coat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and a few seconds it took for him to walk over to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, he pulled out a gun and asked me for money.</sentence><sentence id="1032">I was very calm.</sentence><sentence id="1033">I didn't panic.</sentence><sentence id="1034">I wasn't scared.</sentence><sentence id="1035">My father was in the repair department.</sentence><sentence id="1036">The only thing I said to that man -- he said who is in the back?</sentence><sentence id="1037">I said to the man I'm going to give you some money but my father is in the back.</sentence><sentence id="1038">He has a heart condition.</sentence><sentence id="1039">I don't want you to go over there.</sentence><sentence id="1040">The way I looked at him, I don't know, he took the money and he went.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Once I had another experience.</sentence><sentence id="1044">6 Once in May in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> they have an art show on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1045">So, one day we decided with my wife to go see the art show and look at the work of the artists.</sentence><sentence id="1046">We parked if you're not too familiar with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, we parked on the corner of <span class="DLF">13th Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1047">We looked at all those artists and after that we went to eat in a little <span class="BUILDING">Spanish restaurant</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and when we came back we walked over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1048">It was about 8:00 or 8:30 and in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> you can flip a button and it would open every <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1049">So, I got to my <span class="DLF">door</span>, flip the button and in the meantime my wife goes around to the other <span class="DLF">door</span> and sit down, and I sit down and somebody was holding, let my wife go.</sentence><sentence id="1050">I thought it was a panhandler and I heard him say get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="1051">He pulled a gun out.</sentence><sentence id="1052">He pointed at my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1053">He looked at me and he said you don't want me to hurt your wife.</sentence><sentence id="1054">I said okay I'll give you some money.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Since the incident in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I always carried one wallet with larger bills and I carried a money clip with a lot of single bills in case something like that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So, I had my single bills and it looked like it was a lot of money but it was like maybe $25 or $30 and I told the fellow I said check the ___ and I give him that money.</sentence><sentence id="1057">I was so calm.</sentence><sentence id="1058">I said okay I'll give you the money but how about giving me back my money clip because it is a souvenir.</sentence><sentence id="1059">Just to show you so this might be the result of having lived through that war.</sentence><sentence id="1060">You know, because when you really think about it, in that period of time I was condemned to death if they would have every caught me and I was never scared.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Now, I may be scared of a lot of stuff because I'm old and different things.</sentence><sentence id="1062">In those days, no.</sentence><sentence id="1063">This might be these two occasions might show me how I still react, I'm not scared.</sentence><sentence id="1064">My wife was also amazing because she stayed very calm.</sentence><sentence id="1065">She didn't yell.</sentence><sentence id="1066">After that she said why did you ask him for the money clip.</sentence><sentence id="1067">It's ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="1068">It doesn't make any sense but this is the way I am after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1069">They could have taken me for anything.</sentence><sentence id="1070">So, this is why I figured we survived.</sentence><sentence id="1071">They were not as anti-semitic like the Poles or the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1072">You see, I'm sure there is a lot of anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1073">They were there and they're still there, but they didn't touch us as other Jews of other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1074">Plus we, I don't know we were acting a little more different.</sentence><sentence id="1075">Maybe we were more aggressive.</sentence><sentence id="1076">Maybe I remember I didn't have any feeling</sentence><sentence id="1078">7 of being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1079">If they were to call me a dirty Jew or whatever I wouldn't have turned my back.</sentence><sentence id="1080">I didn't know how.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Q. Do you think the French resistance was effective?A. Very effective.</sentence><sentence id="1082">This is why you have survivors like lam.</sentence><sentence id="1083">They were very effective.</sentence><sentence id="1084">I'm sure some of those French, people in the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1085">I'm sure some of them didn't like us, because we were Jews, but they hated the Germans more than anything.</sentence><sentence id="1086">But they did help us a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1087">We cannot say we survived on our own.</sentence><sentence id="1088">We needed a lot of good French people with good hearts.</sentence><sentence id="1089">For instance like the Mother Superior.</sentence><sentence id="1090">So there must have been a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1091">We lost a lot of Jews, but a lot of them are still here.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Q. Do you ever think about how you really sacrificed your childhood?A. I never thought about it.</sentence><sentence id="1093">Sometimes I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to really enjoy my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1094">Sometimes I'm sorry I never got a better education because when I look at my children, they had a chance in life of going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1095">They have a chance in life of picking their future.</sentence><sentence id="1096">I didn't have a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1097">But I didn't have those chances.</sentence><sentence id="1098">Like I said, I didn't have any use.</sentence><sentence id="1099">The war was there.</sentence><sentence id="1100">The only thing I had in mind was not to be caught and not being killed.</sentence><sentence id="1101">We were condemned to death and this must have done something you know in me.</sentence><sentence id="1102">You know because it's very hard to hope that it would never happen.</sentence><sentence id="1103">But being condemned to death for so long.</sentence><sentence id="1104">Being thought that we were going to be sent to be killed or being thought of doing something in the resistance would mean being shot, it made me work -- lucky I was young.</sentence><sentence id="1105">So, that to me was not that tangible.</sentence><sentence id="1106">I'm sure sometime I must have acted, sometimes my response to somebody looking at me or talking to me may see something I don't see.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Maybe sometime I react in a very aggressive way.</sentence><sentence id="1108">It's almost impossible in my mind in talking to my kid the doctor, it's almost impossible to live four or five years in that condition where you are not affected by it.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Now, I can't personally put my finger on it, but I'm sure if somebody was studying me for a little while they are going to notice he went through that.</sentence><sentence id="1110">I had it easy.</sentence><sentence id="1111">The people who spent two or three years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and survived, those people were really affected.</sentence><sentence id="1112">Also, this is why asking me if it did affect me, I'm sure it did, but it didn't stop</sentence><sentence id="1114">8 me of living and getting married and raising a family.</sentence><sentence id="1115">This is what the beauty of all this, that even after living through all that, you can still keep on going.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I don't see anything else I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Q. Thank you.(viewing pictures.)</sentence><sentence id="1118">A. This is a French identity card.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Every French citizen I think from the age of 12 had to have an identity card.</sentence><sentence id="1120">This is for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1121">In 1941, they called me to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarter</span> to register as a Jew and this is when they put on it the red letters Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1122">If anybody stopped me they will know I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1123">This is a second identity card because <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in those years, when you move from one part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you had to register again with the police and get a new identity card.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So I got an identity card in it's supposed to be in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1125">It was not occupied by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1126">The identity card again with a red stamp with the word Jew on it.</sentence><sentence id="1127">This was in 1943 or the end of "42.</sentence><sentence id="1128">This is an identity card I received to the resistance with a false name.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Instead of being Federman, my name was Richard.</sentence><sentence id="1130">When I was stopped by the authorities, this is what I was showing.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And all this is false identities.</sentence><sentence id="1132">This is an identity card I received because I belonged to the French resistance movement and this I think is some kind of picture on this one.</sentence><sentence id="1133">When I came one day just when I was released from the Army -- when I came out of the Army they wanted me to have my card.</sentence><sentence id="1134">I didn't see any use for it, but they wanted me to have my card with a picture.</sentence><sentence id="1135">An identity card from the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1136">I think they were making some kind of -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1137">This is to testify you know I fought in the resistance during the occupation and I'm entitled to wear a medal or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1138">This picture is what I was wearing at the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I have an armband saying FFI and Thad my gun.</sentence><sentence id="1140">We didn't have any uniform but this is so we could be recognized being in the resistance and other people were in the armbands.</sentence><sentence id="1141">Q. This was when?A. 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1142">That's it?Q. Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="1145">9 Conclusion of Interview</sentence></p></dialogue>
