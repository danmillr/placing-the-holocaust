<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems.</sentence><sentence id="124">I hate to say that.</sentence><sentence id="125">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on.</sentence><sentence id="126">She was in a way, she was beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="127">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn't make it easiest in life, and she suffered.</sentence><sentence id="128">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date.</sentence><sentence id="129">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn't have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that.</sentence><sentence id="130">They fortunately I would say, had no children.</sentence><sentence id="131">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">Both he and she were good speakers.</sentence><sentence id="133">They taught Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="134">Her Hebrew was much better than mine.</sentence><sentence id="135">They were planning to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">I don't recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war.</sentence><sentence id="137">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> until July "deg43.</sentence><sentence id="138">They were sent in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> as I to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">They also were put on the Palestine list.</sentence><sentence id="140">With the Palestine list they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Palestine transport</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: What year was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: That was in July 1944.</sentence><sentence id="164">She has a terrible time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">We didn't see each other too much because I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> in April 11, 1945 leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">She was liberated together with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trovitz</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> and must have died two days after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="169">I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn't tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="170">Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child?</sentence><sentence id="171">Did she play any instruments?</sentence><sentence id="172">Did you have any pets in the family?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: We never had.</sentence><sentence id="174">Yes, we must have had cats somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="175">I remember something about cats.</sentence><sentence id="176">But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don't recall at all that we had pets.</sentence><sentence id="177">We all played an instrument.</sentence><sentence id="178">One of the things I do recall is notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my</sentence><sentence id="180">parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="181">I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste.</sentence><sentence id="182">But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument.</sentence><sentence id="183">I don't remember what my sisters learned, but I'm sure they did too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Is there anything else you would like to mention about Julia?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="223">The only thing I can say is that I do recall that in March 1945, she was very hungry and I had a little piece of bread and she asked me for that piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="224">I never gave it to her.</sentence><sentence id="225">Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tremendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life.</sentence><sentence id="226">I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn't give it to my sister.</sentence><sentence id="227">But I still think about it.</sentence><sentence id="228">It wouldn't have saved her life anyway, but things like that, you know, stay for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="229">That was about the last time I saw her.</sentence><sentence id="230">One of the horrors of life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
