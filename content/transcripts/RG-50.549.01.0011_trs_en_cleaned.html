<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">And, of course, the clothing was the clothing that they had managed to bring from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> mostly, because a lot of inmates in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3">And this was mostly clothing that belonged to Jewish people or other people that were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">And we had to sort things, socks and stockings and underwear.</sentence><sentence id="5">All of it, by the time we got it, | think it was already washed.</sentence><sentence id="6">And there was an SS man in charge.</sentence><sentence id="7">Every morning we had to get up, | do remember we had to get at about 5 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="8">Appell was at 5:30.</sentence><sentence id="9">| was given -- when | came to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, | was given a uniform, a famous gray and blue striped.</sentence><sentence id="10">Basically, what women were given.</sentence><sentence id="11">It's like a dress, not a jacket.</sentence><sentence id="12">Men wore pants -- slacks and jackets, and we wore like long dress.</sentence><sentence id="13">And underneath, since | was working in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, | was permitted the first day when | came, because | probably had rags by the time | got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">But | was permitted to take from the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> a pair panties, | suppose maybe some stockings, maybe slacks.</sentence><sentence id="15">| don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="16">And it was winter.</sentence><sentence id="17">A blouse and a sweater.</sentence><sentence id="18">| didn't have a bra, | didn't any bra.</sentence><sentence id="19">| was just as flat as anything.</sentence><sentence id="20">| was very skinny already.</sentence><sentence id="21">The way one could survive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> when one worked, and that's why the death rate on this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> was a little lower, was that you could steal something and exchange it.</sentence><sentence id="22">So when | finally got to this <span class="BUILDING">working place</span> where that first day that | got my clothing, when | came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">home</span> meaning to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> -- | would, say, take off my sweater.</sentence><sentence id="23">And the next day, | would just put on my blouse and that uniform, and that sweater stayed on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, let's say.</sentence><sentence id="24">Or | sold it that evening for a couple pieces of bread maybe or a bowl of soup.</sentence><sentence id="25">Then the next day, | would go to work, and when | was working, there was always a chance you could sneak in somewhere and get a pair of -- get another sweater and put it on and then | had something.</sentence><sentence id="26">Unfortunately, we had a kapo.</sentence><sentence id="27">A <span class="BUILDING">kapo</span> is a Jewish woman.</sentence><sentence id="28">Actually, she was probably just a couple of years older than |.</sentence><sentence id="29">She was very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="30">She was not a like | was.</sentence><sentence id="31">| was very skinny, | looked like -- | was already at that point a walking skeleton, and | think she disliked me.</sentence><sentence id="32">She disliked all of us who looked so terribly bad, and | thought one day of trying to read.</sentence><sentence id="33">I'm sure something was written about Jewish women -- of course, she was a bitch.</sentence><sentence id="34">But why she was so particularly mean to me and those of us who looked so bad would probably make a good case study for a psychologist.</sentence><sentence id="35">Was it that she saw in me what could happen to her?</sentence><sentence id="36">Probably.</sentence><sentence id="37">There was another reason why she disliked me, and that was my own fault.</sentence><sentence id="38">The SS man who was in charge of our group sent her to get some books from a little -- there was a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where he had some books.</sentence><sentence id="39">He needed something.</sentence><sentence id="40">Well, she was | think illiterate, or if she was not illiterate -- maybe she was not illiterate.</sentence><sentence id="41">But she certainly did not read and write German.</sentence><sentence id="42">| don't know how good her Polish was.</sentence><sentence id="43">| didn't speak to her much.</sentence><sentence id="44">She was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, she came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">She was very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="46">So he sent her to get the book, and she brought the wrong book because she didn't know how to read.</sentence><sentence id="47">But she didn't have the courage to tell him, "I don't read German."</sentence><sentence id="48">So he turned around and looked at me, and he said, "This</sentence><sentence id="50">little one looks smart.</sentence><sentence id="51">Why don't you go and get me the book?"</sentence><sentence id="52">And | made a horrible mistake, and brought him the right book.</sentence><sentence id="53">And she never forgave me for that, so as a result, what she did is the following day when we came on appell, she made me lift up my uniform to check what | missing.</sentence><sentence id="54">And when she saw that | didn't have a blouse on, that | only had the sweater which is what maybe | was hoping to steal so | could have a bowl of soup.</sentence><sentence id="55">Right away, whatever | sold and whatever | got for it | shared with my girlfriend, Frieda, always.</sentence><sentence id="56">So she said -- she started beating on me, of course, and she said, "You're not going to take anything back with you."</sentence><sentence id="57">Even though this was a kind of a gentleman's agreement, everybody did it.</sentence><sentence id="58">She did it, too.</sentence><sentence id="59">And so my career in that sense ended.</sentence><sentence id="60">| had an interesting thing that happened because of it.</sentence><sentence id="61">I'm taking you to a different <span class="NPIP">part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">The girl with whom | shared that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> was a cousin of Frieda's friend in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">When Frieda was taken out from that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, from that <span class="BUILDING">death barrack</span>, very -- originally, if you heard my story, you know that someone whose life was saved my Frieda's sister took her out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And she first didn't want to go, but she went because, of course -- that same, her name was Salka Longett (ph), the same woman who took Frieda out of the <span class="BUILDING">death barrack</span> took out another girl by the name of -- her name was Ruth, and | don't remember her other name now.</sentence><sentence id="65">And Ruth was her girlfriend, so she also saved Ruth.</sentence><sentence id="66">| mean -- | don't mean save, but took her out that horrible <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where the death rate was the highest.</sentence><sentence id="67">So when Frieda was able to get me to this working <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, that friend of hers, Ruth, with whom she became friendly now because they were working together in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, managed to get her cousin.</sentence><sentence id="68">And that cousin's name was -- | don't remember anymore, Franka (ph), Francis.</sentence><sentence id="69">She was a very placid, not very bright girl, and | think she was just not a very nice person.</sentence><sentence id="70">But maybe, maybe just not to me, | don't know.</sentence><sentence id="71">She fared much better with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">First of all, she was not that skinny.</sentence><sentence id="73">As | said, | think she was not that bright.</sentence><sentence id="74">And she was managing to -- and she didn't get sick as | did shortly after that.</sentence><sentence id="75">But whatever it was, but she knew that all of us were bringing things.</sentence><sentence id="76">She didn't know that | was being picked on by the kapo, or she didn't pay attention.</sentence><sentence id="77">What she did do is that after the war, after | was already out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and now I'm going ahead of it.</sentence><sentence id="78">| didn't see my friend, Frieda.</sentence><sentence id="79">| fully expected her to come and see me, and she didn't.</sentence><sentence id="80">She came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> once, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="81">| don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="82">But just the relationship was not what it was, and so | went -- when | was already better, | went to see my girlfriend, Frieda.</sentence><sentence id="83">And she was cold to me, she wasn't very pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="84">| don't know that | ever told anybody that, but | just remembered.</sentence><sentence id="85">So | said, "Frieda" -- we went out for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="86">It was already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">And | said to her, "Frieda, what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="88">Why are you so uncaring?</sentence><sentence id="89">Is something wrong?"</sentence><sentence id="90">And she got very angry.</sentence><sentence id="91">She got very upset, and she said that Francis, the other girl, told her that | did not share with her everything that | was able to get -- you know, that | was getting, bringing some stuff and | was probably selling it and getting maybe some bread.</sentence><sentence id="92">And | want you to know that Frieda was not living in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="93">| mean she was working in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but she was hungry from -- | mean there was just no question that Bergen-Belsen was</sentence><sentence id="95">a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>, even if you work.</sentence><sentence id="96">And she said that she was very hurt when she heard Francis tell her that | did not share, because this was -- you know, we were like sisters.</sentence><sentence id="97">This was an agreement that -- we didn't write anything to each other, but this was a given.</sentence><sentence id="98">And she said to me that that's what Francis told her, that | did not -- that | basically cheated on Frieda.</sentence><sentence id="99">And | got terribly upset, | remember | cried.</sentence><sentence id="100">We had a long talk, and we made up.</sentence><sentence id="101">She believed me.</sentence><sentence id="102">I'm grateful to this day we are still friends.</sentence><sentence id="103">In fact, | just saw her in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="104">But so | had this terrible experience, but it was this Francis with whom | shared, that bum.</sentence><sentence id="105">And it was this Francis who | remember, because she did not get sick as | did, when | was so sick toward the end of my stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> that she just was just a very uncaring person, at least as far as | was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="106">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: The close relationship that you had with Frieda was clearly very important to you.</sentence><sentence id="214">Was that -- did other women have close relationships like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: That was very important to many of us.</sentence><sentence id="218">Very often a relationship such as this was was there between, let's say, two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="219">If some of them were lucky and they had a mother and daughter, but usually two sisters, two cousins.</sentence><sentence id="220">Interestingly enough, not always did the two sisters get along.</sentence><sentence id="221">It was not always, but many of us did form these kind of relationships, and it was extremely important for all kinds of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="222">| mean not just -- first of all, it was important to survival.</sentence><sentence id="223">When we were on the death march, when Frieda couldn't walk, | dragged her.</sentence><sentence id="224">And when she didn't want to get up, | pushed her.</sentence><sentence id="225">Or | couldn't -- and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, if it wouldn't be for Frieda, | probably wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you.</sentence><sentence id="226">There's no question that she saved my life, and | don't think this was true just for me.</sentence><sentence id="227">We had a lot of us formed these kind of relationships.</sentence><sentence id="228">| know that Henry, my husband, had a kind of -- actually, he was with a group, but he had one friend who | didn't even know about, because Henry doesn't talk much.</sentence><sentence id="229">But we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> a couple of years ago, and we were staying with one of his friends with whom he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span></sentence><sentence id="230">And his name is Jacob, and they were awfully nice to us.</sentence><sentence id="231">We had a tour, but then we stayed a couple of days with them.</sentence><sentence id="232">And Jacob told me for the first time, | didn't know, that he's alive because of Henry.</sentence><sentence id="233">That Henry literally carried him during the death march.</sentence><sentence id="234">Henry never told me that, but these things were happening to a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="235">This was very important to have somebody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Once the British came and you started to get your health back, you stayed there because it became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>; is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: How did -- what was your life like there, let's just say, for like the first three months or so of that summer of 1945?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: I'm trying to remember.</sentence><sentence id="262">| probably came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- | was liberated on April 15th.</sentence><sentence id="263">| have no dates to give you, | don't remember when | was -- they</sentence><sentence id="265">probably took me out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as soon as | was not contagious.</sentence><sentence id="266">Because when | was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, | had paratyphus, but | was already lucid.</sentence><sentence id="267">|, for instance, remember being taken out, not fully, but | remember that they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or something, since the sick people went first.</sentence><sentence id="268">But | do remember being sprayed with DDT, | always talk about it; it's such a wonderful feeling.</sentence><sentence id="269">And | remember that the <span class="DLF">air</span>, when we're driven out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, the <span class="DLF">air</span> smelled so sweet once we left.</sentence><sentence id="270">But | don't remember how long | was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">It was not probably a very long time because | think that it was already in May | was already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>, actually, you probably know about it, was formed in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span>, not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273"><span class="COUNTRY">Bergen</span> had -- these were army, this was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">army camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And what the British did, is that they took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Army camp</span>, and they turned it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">The Jews were not the only inmates there.</sentence><sentence id="276">They had Russians -- | don't think there were too many Poles there, meaning non-Jewish Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="277">There was Polish, but no Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="278">They had men and women, but they kept the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> separately.</sentence><sentence id="279">So | was put in, | remember | was in Block -- if I'm not mistaken -- Block Number 73, which was one of the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> where the women were put.</sentence><sentence id="280">And what they would do, we were given a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the blocks was a two-story <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">| don't remember how many <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were on each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, but | do remember that we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and showers on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and then one -- so | have no idea how many.</sentence><sentence id="282">| don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="283">| do know that | was given a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the second story, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> with this Francis.</sentence><sentence id="284">Probably because | came out with her, and | very quickly moved out.</sentence><sentence id="285">| didn't want to share with her.</sentence><sentence id="286">There may have been somebody else in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">And | meta very nice girl who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, who was about five years older than |.</sentence><sentence id="288">And | actually came to borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">frying pan</span> from her, | wanted to do something.</sentence><sentence id="289">And we became very friendly, and she took me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where she shared with three other women.</sentence><sentence id="290">And so we were five of us in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and we also had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, but these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were now private.</sentence><sentence id="291">| had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, and there was one above me and there were five or six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">Because | think eventually, we took in another girl, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had -- so we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">It was a good-sized <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="294">And then there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, | suppose, for clothing.</sentence><sentence id="295">People had clothing.</sentence><sentence id="296">And then, of course, if we wanted to wash and <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or use the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, there was one big communal.</sentence><sentence id="297">| suppose this was the way soldiers lived in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, so that's -- it was summer.</sentence><sentence id="298">We were coming out from a bad situation, we had food.</sentence><sentence id="299">It was not wonderful food, but we were -- I'm trying to remember.</sentence><sentence id="300">We probably were given all the bread we -- we had enough.</sentence><sentence id="301">| remember for the first time not being hungry, which means that we were given soups.</sentence><sentence id="302">| think ONR moved in rather quickly and provided, they had big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">We had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> to pick up our -- | think, midday soup meal.</sentence><sentence id="304">In other words, we were given soup and probably bread.</sentence><sentence id="305">| don't remember anything more than that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: What did you do during the first few weeks?</sentence><sentence id="353">What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="354">Were you strong enough to go out?</sentence><sentence id="355">Could you leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: | don't remember leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">| think what we did in the beginning, we were trying to -- | have all kinds of memories.</sentence><sentence id="365">Well, the first thing that we tried to do is to find out who was alive.</sentence><sentence id="366">| remember going to the -- there was already probably something, a <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> formed.</sentence><sentence id="367">In fact, there was one.</sentence><sentence id="368">In fact, if you ever heard about Hadassah, Gross Rosen, her husband, she by that time was not married to him.</sentence><sentence id="369">She comes from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">Her name was Hadassah Binka (ph), | think it was.</sentence><sentence id="371">She was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="372">She survived, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">| think her husband-to-be, much older than |.</sentence><sentence id="374">If not much older, certainly he was an adult before the war.</sentence><sentence id="375">So there must have been Jewish who formed some kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and maybe they were the ones who worked with ONR to start bringing things.</sentence><sentence id="376">So | remember going there probably, and trying to get lists of people who survived.</sentence><sentence id="377">My girlfriend, Esther, started volunteering in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">| probably took care of things in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">Maybe | was the one.</sentence><sentence id="380">Because everybody was doing something.</sentence><sentence id="381">| was probably the one who would go and get the food.</sentence><sentence id="382">| was probably still weaker than the other girls there because | had come out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, and they were not -- they came directly from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">There were some, | have a memory of sitting on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">So | think that behind the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, there may have been some <span class="DLF">lawns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">We probably would sit around and talk.</sentence><sentence id="386">We probably talked a lot about what happened to us and about our family and whether we're going to find anybody.</sentence><sentence id="387">That was in the beginning, | had a very difficult then with my girlfriend, Esther.</sentence><sentence id="388">| found Frieda, remember | told the story what happened.</sentence><sentence id="389">She was already at that point sharing a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with some other people with whom she was, so we never -- we did not get back together that way, because | had found Esther.</sentence><sentence id="390">But our relationship was great, that was the problem.</sentence><sentence id="391">| was -- my girlfriend, Esther, was very hopeful that her boyfriend survived.</sentence><sentence id="392">She came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>, and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, she was an only child.</sentence><sentence id="393">But she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with her parents.</sentence><sentence id="394">She was separated from her parents, but managed to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with her boyfriend's mother and sister.</sentence><sentence id="395">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together, they ended up at some, | don't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="396">| think they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, but | don't remember, and they ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">And my girlfriend, Esther, who as | told you was about five years older than I, that she mothered me because, you know, | was -- in 1945, | was born in 1946, so | was 19 right after the way, not quite 20.</sentence><sentence id="398">So my -- no, | wasn't even -- wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="399">| was born in 1946, | was not even 19; | was 18, going on 19.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: So what happened to her that she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, talking about my girlfriend, Esther.</sentence><sentence id="446">With her boyfriend's mother, and she was practically engaged to be married to this guy.</sentence><sentence id="447">Having been five years older than |, she was -- | know that she graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="448">She was born in 1921, yeah, so she</sentence><sentence id="450">was about five years older.</sentence><sentence id="451">Anyway, she buried that future mother-in-law and her boyfriend's sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">In other words, they didn't survive, but she had hoped that her boyfriend survived.</sentence><sentence id="453">She had heard from somebody that he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with his brother.</sentence><sentence id="454">And then, must have been about a month after the liberation, maybe a little longer, but | remember that we were together in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the other girls.</sentence><sentence id="455">And somebody came with the news, must have been a friend of her husband -- of her boyfriend.</sentence><sentence id="456">In fact, it was a friend, | remember, who was his friend and told her that -- his name was Manik (ph), | don't what, the Polish name was Manik, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="457">That he was killed a day -- he died or something happened a day after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="458">Just a day after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="459">And my girlfriend, Esther, went into what | now know, into a deep depression.</sentence><sentence id="460">She refused to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, she stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">And | was very concerned for her.</sentence><sentence id="462">And | do remember that | would sit and | would sing to her for hours.</sentence><sentence id="463">The other girls, we all tried to take care of her, but | was the closest to her.</sentence><sentence id="464">And | would sit there for hours, and | would sing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="486">Q: What would you sing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: All kinds of songs.</sentence><sentence id="489">Polish songs, anything that | remembered.</sentence><sentence id="490">| came from a bit of singing family.</sentence><sentence id="491">My mom had a beautiful voice, and we always sang at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">So | sang whatever, you know.</sentence><sentence id="493">And | would try to make her eat, and friends came.</sentence><sentence id="494">In fact, Henry, my husband, who was not my friend then, but he knew Esther because he comes from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="495">And they were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the same <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="496">Anyway, | remember he would come and bring some goodies.</sentence><sentence id="497">Men always managed to bring some food.</sentence><sentence id="498">They managed to -- he probably already was getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="499">But | don't remember how long it lasted, but | think that what | did then and | talked to her.</sentence><sentence id="500">And | would have a talk to help, and then -- originally, first, of course, she was talking about her boyfriend and Manik and what friends they had and how much she loved him and all that.</sentence><sentence id="501">But then | would -- today, | suppose | could say that maybe | acted as a therapist.</sentence><sentence id="502">But | didn't have any schooling, | just did something instinctively trying to help her.</sentence><sentence id="503">So | started to ask her to tell me about life before the war, what she did before the war.</sentence><sentence id="504">What <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she went to, who were her friends.</sentence><sentence id="505">And then she told me that she had a boyfriend before the war, that she had a boyfriend, and they were kind of like childhood sweethearts.</sentence><sentence id="506">And in 1939 when the war broke out, her boyfriend, whose name was Lolak (ph), and his father -- his father was a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span>, and they knew because they were intelligentsia that they're going to be -- they were in anger.</sentence><sentence id="507">They were told that the best thing for them is to get out.</sentence><sentence id="508">At that time it wasn't because he was Jewish, this was when the Germans were removing the Polish intelligentsia, and among them, of course, the educated Jews, too.</sentence><sentence id="509">So Lolak's father, his name was Seka and Lolak decided to run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="510">And they came to Esther, and they wanted her to go with them.</sentence><sentence id="511">Lolak, her boyfriend, was a year older than Esther, and he graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span> in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="512">He was accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, but he waited for</sentence><sentence id="514">Esther, who was also accepted.</sentence><sentence id="515">And they were going to go in 1939 to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but they missed it because war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="516">So they were really serious about each other, and he wanted her to go with him to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">But she was an only child and she couldn't leave her parents, so they parted company and he escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> with his father.</sentence><sentence id="518">When she started to talk to me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lolak</span>, | kept going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lolak</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">Whenever she would mention her boyfriend, then apparently life took its course.</sentence><sentence id="520">Lolak was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, she was a very pretty girl.</sentence><sentence id="521">She met this guy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and they became close and had he survived, I'm sure she would have ended up with him.</sentence><sentence id="522">But | just wanted to know about all of that, and | made her talk to me about all that.</sentence><sentence id="523">And | was singing to her, and she was so -- | think that | probably spent probably the rest of that month, May, maybe into, | would say -- | would say that it took about maybe a month to get her back out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">And she did get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and she went back to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where she had started before she decided that life is not worth anything.</sentence><sentence id="525">And | want to tell you that -- two things: Number one when she came back, when she came back to herself, somebody came and told me that my father is alive and was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">| had...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: That's your. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: My father.</sentence><sentence id="571">That somebody by the name of Aaron Nakabovich (ph), that's my father's name, is alive, and he should be somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">Now, | had not seen him on the list, but somebody said that they saw him on the list.</sentence><sentence id="573">| did find my sister at that point -- no, | didn't.</sentence><sentence id="574">| knew my sister had a chance to survive.</sentence><sentence id="575">No, | didn't know anything about my sister, but | put my name on the list.</sentence><sentence id="576">And when | heard that my father is alive, | decided to go and look for her.</sentence><sentence id="577">Now, this is an interesting story.</sentence><sentence id="578">Because what happened is that traveling through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that point was impossible, but people did.</sentence><sentence id="579">We were looking for people, so the first thing that was necessary was to outfit me for the trip.</sentence><sentence id="580">And my girlfriend, Esther, who was not a wondertul thief, stole -- | didn't have shoes.</sentence><sentence id="581">| had like cloppers, it was summer.</sentence><sentence id="582">And | probably had some clothing that the ONR gave me, but where I'm going to go on a trip, | need something a little more decent than that.</sentence><sentence id="583">A warm jacket maybe.</sentence><sentence id="584">Evenings in Europe, even in the summer, are cold, colder.</sentence><sentence id="585">So she stole shoes, two shoes for me.</sentence><sentence id="586">But they were two left shoes, they were, you know, kind of like, you know, like shoes with lace.</sentence><sentence id="587">Good walking shoes.</sentence><sentence id="588">So she stole them, or organized them as we used to call it in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">Somebody gave me, or maybe | had a pair of slacks.</sentence><sentence id="590">And then another girl -- the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> got together and they outfitted me.</sentence><sentence id="591">So | got a pair of slacks and | got a nice shirt anda shirt to change, and a sweater or a jacket, and even a kerchief.</sentence><sentence id="592">And Esther was telling me how to, if | need to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or | need to step down or something, since I'm wearing slacks, you can't tell that they are two left shoes.</sentence><sentence id="593">But if | always step out with my left foot, then nobody will notice that | have two left shoes.</sentence><sentence id="594">Managed very well with these two left shoes, so | went, but I didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="595">It had to be arranged.</sentence><sentence id="596">| didn't go alone.</sentence><sentence id="597">| went with, actually, Henry and a friend of his, because they had had pneumonia and they were being sent to a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> just to</sentence><sentence id="599">make sure that it doesn't develop into something else.</sentence><sentence id="600">So they were going to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, and | wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, so | went with them.</sentence><sentence id="601">And it was an experience, because you couldn't buy tickets.</sentence><sentence id="602">You had to -- some of Henry's friends literally carried us and threw us into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">| don't know how we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">| know how we did.</sentence><sentence id="605">Henry had a friend who was already working for the British, he spoke English.</sentence><sentence id="606">So he managed to borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="607">So the three of us, with his friend -- his name was Alexander, took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">We went from -- and a couple of his friends must have gone along, because | remember being thrown into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through the <span class="DLF">window</span>, okay.</sentence><sentence id="609">And somehow the three of us got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to the -- stopped at the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">Because, you see, we're in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="611">So we had to get through to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, but this was the beginning of the war.</sentence><sentence id="612">The soldiers were very sympathetic to us, they knew who we were.</sentence><sentence id="613">All we had to do is tell them that we are Jewish, DP, you know, people -- refugees.</sentence><sentence id="614">And the Americans let us through, we didn't have to -- later on that became much more difficult, but at that point, it was easy.</sentence><sentence id="615">| do want to tell you this, and this was very important.</sentence><sentence id="616">The American and the British, | don't know about the Russian soldiers were extremely nice to us in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="617">When they shipped the <span class="BUILDING">American boys home</span>, and they knew the young -- | don't know -- the young, they knew what Americans, | suppose, wanted to do and maybe the British did the same.</sentence><sentence id="618">They wanted to send the war-weary soldiers <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so they sent them <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="619">And then when the new soldiers came in, those who didn't see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, those who didn't see what we went through, they started fraternizing with the frauleins, with the German girls and they were much nastier to us.</sentence><sentence id="620">They were not so understanding, it was much harder.</sentence><sentence id="621">It was painful, too.</sentence><sentence id="622">So that's -- but, you know, | remember at that time being very angry about it, but | now understand why a little better.</sentence><sentence id="623">But anyway, | went through, we went through to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="624">| got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, turned out that this was not my father, of course.</sentence><sentence id="625">But when | came back, oh, | also want to tell you -- | also want to tell you that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> wasn't always -- then one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that we took on that was really funny.</sentence><sentence id="626">We had -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was devastated.</sentence><sentence id="627">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were bombed out.</sentence><sentence id="628">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- the trip that should have taken maybe, | don't know, 10 hours, we were traveling for a week.</sentence><sentence id="629">We would stop in <span class="NPIP">places</span>, we would stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>, some Jewish inmates would take us in.</sentence><sentence id="630">Then we would go farther.</sentence><sentence id="631">It was a whole undertaking.</sentence><sentence id="632">| remember being, for one stretch of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, we hitched -- we managed to hitch- hike or something, | don't know.</sentence><sentence id="633">We managed to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that carried oil or gas, because they were those round -- what do they call them?</sentence><sentence id="634">| suppose, trying to remember.</sentence><sentence id="635">They looked like a big, round barrel, and you couldn't -- there was no way, and the only thing it had like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> in front for | suppose the conductors.</sentence><sentence id="636">And | remember Henry and | and his friend, we were sitting on one of those little, it looked like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: Was this the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank car</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="711">A: It was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, but it was like a round.</sentence><sentence id="712">And in front on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>, it had these -- there is a name for it.</sentence><sentence id="713">It looked like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, but it wasn't a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, with the little <span class="DLF">railing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">And | suppose you could stand on it, or if you were weary, as we were, we would sit down.</sentence><sentence id="715">And since it was night, we would hold onto the <span class="DLF">railing</span>, and since it was night, we would doze off.</sentence><sentence id="716">Because | remember occasionally, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were moving very slowly, but nevertheless, | remember once in a while kind of feeling that I'm sliding down.</sentence><sentence id="717">| suppose when you're young, you don't worry about it, but it was not always the safest way of traveling but we did it.</sentence><sentence id="718">And, as | say, | did get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, but by that time | had parted company from them.</sentence><sentence id="719">And, you know, | don't recall how | got back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, because that was probably an experience; | was alone.</sentence><sentence id="720">But again, what was helpful is that if | met some Jewish -- | remember getting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, and | don't remember how | paid for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721">| think what probably happened is that somebody -- | said something, and somebody said to me, "Am who?"</sentence><sentence id="722">It means -- it was kind of a Jewish password, which meant are you from my <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>, are you from my people?Because there were a couple of guys who | think paid for me and asked me where | was going.</sentence><sentence id="723">And | was telling them that | was looking for -- | had an address, but it was already in the evening, so they suggested that they would take me to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, to wherever they were staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="724">And it's funny, there were two guys; | didn't know them from Adam, and | said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="725">Well, | had no choice anyway.</sentence><sentence id="726">| could have, | suppose -- to stay on the <span class="DLF">street</span> would have been ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="727">They felt that it was too late for me to get to where | was going, so they took me with them.</sentence><sentence id="728">And | think they had some kind of an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they must have gotten an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from a German family.</sentence><sentence id="729">And they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there was no other -- there were just the two of them.</sentence><sentence id="730">You know, when | think about it, they could have raped me.</sentence><sentence id="731">It doesn't matter, they actually they were very nice, they gave breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="732">And | think they even took me to where | needed to go, and then | found that my father was not alive.</sentence><sentence id="733">But | found a cousin, a distant cousin.</sentence><sentence id="734">Who was it?</sentence><sentence id="735">My mother's cousin, who was younger than my mom.</sentence><sentence id="736">Anyway, she survived, and she already had a boyfriend or something.</sentence><sentence id="737">Because | remember she gave me some money, she gave me some clothing.</sentence><sentence id="738">| don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="739">And she told me that my sister's alive.</sentence><sentence id="740">So that was great news, so | somehow managed to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span>, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="741">And I'm trying to remember how | got back there, but | don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="742">| probably took the same, you know, chance with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

anything, perhaps a little triumph that Hitler didn't accomplish everything, that somehow we're here.</sentence><sentence id="2161">And, you know, | married and | have a son and a daughter, so, you know, why should | feel guilty about that?</sentence><sentence id="2162">But to go somewhere and try to understand and to make peace with the Holocaust on an emotional level, | don't try and | can't.</sentence><sentence id="2163">When | get a bad <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, when | have a nightmare, | either take a pill or | get up and read a book.</sentence><sentence id="2164">Henry

father because they were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> together, and he had this three, four-day, you know, gray growth.</sentence><sentence id="2167">And his father gave him something that he had, they came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le6dz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2168">That was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to begin with, and so he didn't have much.</sentence><sentence id="2169">Maybe he had some cigars and maybe he had some -- maybe he a silver dollar or something.</sentence><sentence id="2170">And he gave it to Henry and he said, "Take it.</sentence><sentence id="2171">| don't need it anymore."</sentence><sentence id="2172">Or something.</sentence><sentence id="2173">And | know when Henry has that <span class="NPIP">dream</span> or when he sees this, he just gets out of <span

crime story and he reads.</sentence><sentence id="2177">You can't solve anything about that.</sentence><sentence id="2178">But | needed to solve for myself, | don't mean solve.</sentence><sentence id="2179">| needed to understand how God could permit that.</sentence><sentence id="2180">Now, Henry doesn't have this problem because | think he's an atheist or he" an agnostic.</sentence><sentence id="2181">So he's not asking God how God could allow it.</sentence><sentence id="2182">Insofar as he's concerned, he has an expression, he says, "Shit falls."</sentence><sentence id="2183">Look what's going on all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="2184">There are people killing people in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2185">So maybe in that sense he doesn't

have solved it, and | think I've said that perhaps in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, when | read a book by Dr. Fakenheim (ph), Professor Fakenheim, | think he was a professor at the

id="2197">He said that God was</sentence><sentence id="2199">not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that God gave us -- when you speak to the Jews, he gave us the Torah, but that's not important.</sentence><sentence id="2200">He gave, he taught people what is right and what is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2201">And if we choose to do the wrong thing, then we do it.</sentence><sentence id="2202">And God didn't create <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the Germans did.</sentence><sentence id="2203">And what happened in <span

id="2206">In our time, God does not interfere.</sentence><sentence id="2207">So | have that kind of a peace with myself that | don't blame God for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>; |

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2276">Q: | want to ask you something that you have not spoken about, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2277">First of all, | wanted to ask you this because to so many survivors it's an issue.</sentence><sentence id="2278">And that is did you talk to your children about your experience?</sentence><sentence id="2279">And if you did, when did you and why did you?</sentence><sentence id="2280">And if you didn't, why didn't you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2286">A: Oh, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2287">Well, you know, it would be nice if my daughter could -- because | sometimes talk to her about it.</sentence><sentence id="2288">| did talk to my children.</sentence><sentence id="2289">| think at different times, and it depended -- when the reason came.</sentence><sentence id="2290">| didn't live it all the time with them.</sentence><sentence id="2291">Actually, when the kids were little, wnen they were growing up in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, these were really happy times for us in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="2292">But | talked to them because when they were little, and they wanted to know, for instance, why Lisa Zidner has a grandmother who's coming to visit and Janie has a grandpa and grandma coming, and where are my parents and where are Henry's parents?</sentence><sentence id="2293">So | told them that both my parents and Daddy's parents are not alive.</sentence><sentence id="2294">Why aren't they alive?</sentence><sentence id="2295">| said, "Well, they died in the war." "</sentence><sentence id="2296">How did they die?" "</sentence><sentence id="2297">Well, they didn't die -- they died because of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2298">And when you will be bigger, | will explain it.".</sentence><sentence id="2299">And | did, and, of course, in 1959 they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with me, and we talked a little bit more about it.</sentence><sentence id="2300">The children were still little.</sentence><sentence id="2301">When they got bigger -- and | did.</sentence><sentence id="2302">For instance, on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tu B'Shevat</span>, | always lit candles.</sentence><sentence id="2303">That | did even though | didn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because this was the anniversary of the destruction of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2304">So | lit candles, and when the kids were big enough and they would ask me why I'm doing it.</sentence><sentence id="2305">And | told them I'm lighting the candles to remember my mom and my father and my sister and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And as they were getting bigger, | would tell them about some of the things that happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="2307">Depending on their age when they got big enough.</sentence><sentence id="2308">Henry did much less of it.</sentence><sentence id="2309">He had a lot of trouble talking about it.</sentence><sentence id="2310">On the other hand, and | did discuss this with my daughter, | asked her whether she feels - - because | wanted to know.</sentence><sentence id="2311">That was some many years later, whether she was -- when | read the book my Helen Epstein, did you read it?</sentence><sentence id="2312">Helen Epstein wrote a book called, "The Children of the Holocaust."</sentence><sentence id="2313">| think she wrote about that second generation.</sentence><sentence id="2314">And | was very upset when | read the book, because apparently she wrote the book, she based it upon a study that was done.</sentence><sentence id="2315">Or maybe she did the study, discussing it with a psychiatrist or some psychiatrist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, whose children -- whose patients were children of Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2316">And she paints a</sentence><sentence id="2318">picture of real neurotic, disturbed children, and | was upset.</sentence><sentence id="2319">First of all, the first thing | did at that point, | wanted to know from my daughter and from my son whether something like this -- after all, no matter how objective you think you are, you're not objective, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2320">Did I?</sentence><sentence id="2321">Did | fill them with these kind of -- some of the stories that she writes about, you know, these children really grew up in very dysfunctional, difficult <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2322">So | talked to my kids, and both my children told me, and this was not right away, but through the years; this is the picture | got from them.</sentence><sentence id="2323">That theirs was a happy childhood, that they had a good <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2324">That they were aware of a lot of things and they were not totally not affected.</sentence><sentence id="2325">In other words, okay, in other words, what they -- then, as a matter of fact, let me tell you how they saw.</sentence><sentence id="2326">That they were not to be compared with the children that Helen Epstein is talking about fully.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And, in fact, it was Robbi (ph) who came out, my daughter, with the idea that perhaps we were lucky, Henry and |.</sentence><sentence id="2328">We had survived the Holocaust and we were young.</sentence><sentence id="2329">| had lost my parents, lost my sister and my brother, but | didn't lose a husband and | didn't lose children.</sentence><sentence id="2330">Many of the children described in Helen's books were raised as second children.</sentence><sentence id="2331">They were raised by people who had lost not just their past, but their future.</sentence><sentence id="2332">Some of these people lost their children.</sentence><sentence id="2333">Later | met some -- | know some people were -- sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2334">Robbi had a friend who told her -- he was a survivor's son -- that he didn't know that he had a sister until his father was on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2335">When his father was dying, he told him that before the war, he was married and he had a daughter.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Why these people could not deal with it, | don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2337">| belonged to the generation, and there were many like me, who survived the war and did not lose husbands and children.</sentence><sentence id="2338">| was too young for that.</sentence><sentence id="2339">That may have made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="2340">| think that for anybody who studies the Holocaust survivors, | think they should draw that <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2341">That was more difficult for people who had that.</sentence><sentence id="2342">So in that sense, I'm not taking any credit, it may have been easier.</sentence><sentence id="2343">Did my children -- were my children affected by some of it?</sentence><sentence id="2344">Definitely.</sentence><sentence id="2345">In what way?</sentence><sentence id="2346">Well, first of all, the fact that Henry did not talk was not very good.</sentence><sentence id="2347">It would have helped if he did.</sentence><sentence id="2348">On the other hand, | can't say that he never talked.</sentence><sentence id="2349">He talked about before the war how things were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2350">He just didn't talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, he couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2351">And that was probably -- but | did.</sentence><sentence id="2352">And | think that was -- Robbi always felt that that was good.</sentence><sentence id="2353">That | had, that they didn't have to imagine things being worse than they were, so that was helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2354">On the other hand, Robbi said that | was neurotic about certain things, and, for instance, | was probably overprotective.</sentence><sentence id="2355">| tried not to be.</sentence><sentence id="2356">Up here, | tried not to be.</sentence><sentence id="2357">| sent my son and my daughter -- my daughter was 10 years old when she went for four weeks to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and my son was nine and a half.</sentence><sentence id="2358">In other words, | sent them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2359">| gave them a lot of freedom.</sentence><sentence id="2360">| did not -- but that was up here.</sentence><sentence id="2361">Emotionally, | suppose if Robbi was late from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, | may have been a little more upset than | should have.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Fortunately, even though Henry did not -- Henry acted in this sense as good balance.</sentence><sentence id="2363">When |, when we went -- when the kids learned how to swim and we'd be going to a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and | would go with the kids, and they learned how to jump from the, what is it?</sentence><sentence id="2364">From the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2365">And so we made an</sentence><sentence id="2367">agreement, so | said to them, "Okay, when I'm not here, you can't jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2368">You can swim."</sentence><sentence id="2369">And so the kids said, "Why?</sentence><sentence id="2370">Why can't we?</sentence><sentence id="2371">We're good swimmers."</sentence><sentence id="2372">By the way, I'm not a swimmer.</sentence><sentence id="2373">| can float.</sentence><sentence id="2374">So when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but | said, "No, | won't allow you when I'm not here."</sentence><sentence id="2375">So the kids as usually they would take their case to their father.</sentence><sentence id="2376">So they would say to Henry, "Daddy, Mom won't let us jump off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving board</span> when she's not there."</sentence><sentence id="2377">So Henry looked at me and he said, "Bella, tell me what is the difference?"</sentence><sentence id="2378">First of all, he thought it was funny.</sentence><sentence id="2379">He said, "What could you do for them if you were there watching?"</sentence><sentence id="2380">So that was already -- but anyway, | said, "Well, I'll feel better if I'm there.</sentence><sentence id="2381">I'll holler for help."</sentence><sentence id="2382">Well, anyway, this was said to me.</sentence><sentence id="2383">Henry said to me, "You can either be there all the time, but you cannot restrict them."</sentence><sentence id="2384">So that was settled, and this was how we settled some of theses.</sentence><sentence id="2385">So yeah, | had some, | wouldn't let Craig ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> until Henry said that this is crazy, and then Craig rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2386">But we settled this.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2492">A: Yeah, we did, we did.</sentence><sentence id="2493">Yeah, we did.</sentence><sentence id="2494">On the other hand, when Craig went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, he didn't tell me.</sentence><sentence id="2495">This is how | found out about the book.</sentence><sentence id="2496">He took a course on the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2497">He has a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> on the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2498">That's not his <span class="DLF">field</span>, but, you know, this his interest.</sentence><sentence id="2499">There's no question.</sentence><sentence id="2500">So were the kids affected?</sentence><sentence id="2501">| think so, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="2502">But perhaps not in a totally damaging way, | don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2503">| hope not.</sentence><sentence id="2504">My daughter had some problems, but | don't think they had anything to do with the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2505">In fact, she used to say to me that when she had -- she had a chemical disorder.</sentence><sentence id="2506">She had a premenstrual, what is it?</sentence><sentence id="2507">Premenstrual syndrome, PMS, that led practically to depression until they finally medicated her.</sentence><sentence id="2508">It was just totally uncalled for, because it wasn't recognized.</sentence><sentence id="2509">But she said to me that it got to a point that when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> and she started having problems.</sentence><sentence id="2510">And she would go for help, and she said, "Mom, | got to a point where | wouldn't tell them that I'm a Holocaust survivor's child, because they would get into it, " and she said, "and my problem had nothing to do with the Holocaust."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2511">Q: So she was aware of...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2512">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2513">But as | say, she's fine.</sentence><sentence id="2514">And she's on medication, but if it hadn't been neglected.</sentence><sentence id="2515">She had some rough years because of that.</sentence><sentence id="2516">But it was, she said on the other hand, she probably is a little bit more high-strung than she would have been if she hadn't been raised in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by a mother who, when the phone ring, | would jump.</sentence><sentence id="2517">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
