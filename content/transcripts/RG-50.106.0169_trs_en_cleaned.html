and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking sense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else, anyway.</sentence><sentence id="719">So they said, okay, what is your name?</sentence><sentence id="720">They wrote down the letters Fievish Nicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born
