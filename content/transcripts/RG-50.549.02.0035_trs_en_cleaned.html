<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned.</sentence><sentence id="195">And it was very interesting, there was a trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, because we - - well, I don't know, do you want me to talk about that?</sentence><sentence id="196">Well, when we came to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, on May fifth, 1945, I'll never forget the day we were liberated, the war was over, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="197">Actually, the very end of March, it was like

could go on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">We could -- had to stay in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="201">And we were all in this big <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> and I remember one day we were walking, my</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="205">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0035 8 sister and I and there was a woman working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we asked her, "Are there any Jews here?"</sentence><sentence id="206">And she said, "When you Germans --" she thought we were Germans -- "When you Germans are going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, the Jews will come back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>."</sentence><sentence id="207">And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="208">And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no?</sentence><sentence id="209">When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the Christmas trees were still in the <span class="BUILDING">people's homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">So we knew it was around that time.</sentence><sentence id="212">We didn't know exactly the dates and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="213">And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day -- my sister was so sick with typhus.</sentence><sentence id="214">By then, already, my mother was taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">I was with her inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and that, you have that, I'm sure, on the tape.</sentence><sentence id="216">And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened.</sentence><sentence id="217">Because the mo- most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know.</sentence><sentence id="218">And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that's why I was back a couple of times to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell.</sentence><sentence id="220">So we -- my sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, "I can't go on."</sentence><sentence id="221">She was -- she had</sentence></p><p><sentence id="224"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0035 9 typhus.</sentence><sentence id="225">Just right then, she had gotten typhus.</sentence><sentence id="226">And I kept saying, "We will live, we will live."</sentence><sentence id="227">And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> opened up and the bombs started to fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run.</sentence><sentence id="228">And I had no energy.</sentence><sentence id="229">I just fell into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me.</sentence><sentence id="230">She was holding me up.</sentence><sentence id="231">I don't know who was holding who, we were all three.</sentence><sentence id="232">And we saw a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we walked across the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">And the woman opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm.</sentence><sentence id="234">And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="235">And that's where they took all the people, to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="236">And they gave us some food and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food.</sentence><sentence id="237">And we stayed there a couple of hours, til night time.</sentence><sentence id="238">And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl and clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">Why she did it -- you know, my sister always says, "You gave -- give that woman credit that she saved our lives."</sentence><sentence id="240">And I said, "Yeah, because if she hadn't taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn't told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives."</sentence><sentence id="241">What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there.</sentence><sentence id="242">And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">And so, anyways, we went</sentence><sentence id="245"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0035 10 with this so -- Russian guy and he said, "I'm not taking you to the <span
