When I was masquerading, I had to blend -- almost hundred percent the local population, to the Slavic r. So naturally, I tried to eliminate r from any possible word that I can -- that I can.</sentence><sentence id="25">Otherwise, probably, I would have remained Petrenka, because Petrenka is not a Jewish name.</sentence><sentence id="26">But, I have chosen Mewashefsky.</sentence><sentence id="27">I stayed with minash -- Mewashefsky till I got married to Norman s -- actually Naftali Salishitz at that time.</sentence><sentence id="28">So I became <span class="BUILDING">Amalie Salishitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, he changed his name Salishitz to Salsitz, because his oldest brother, who was here for 20 years, at -- before m-my husband -- after my husband was born.</sentence><sentence id="30">So he wanted to have the same family name so he beca -- I became Amalie Salsitz.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: We will speak later about all three of you, but especially who Amalie Salsitz became in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but for the time being, let's talk -- let's go back a -- or stay with the time just before liberation.</sentence><sentence id="116">What was your state of mind, and what were the events that followed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Just few months before the liberation, were this first German evacuation.</sentence><sentence id="120">Was a very trying time for me because one part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was liberated half year before I was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="121">I was tempted to run over to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>, or the Russian -- o-or the la -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jeshuf townoof</span>, and to shorten my time of expectation, meantime I could have been killed.</sentence><sentence id="122">But then I decided it's very risky, even to run to the Russian tine, so I will endure, and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, where I survived.</sentence><sentence id="123">And also, I was offered, and requested, by my two companies, the first company vi -- m -- batonin -- isen bentongbal by Wilhelm Langert from Swekow saxon, to evacuate with him and his company.</sentence><sentence id="124">I refused on the grounds that I don't want to leave my <span class="REGION">motherland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And the same thing, first I was also requested to evacuate with the second company, Myrader and Krauss, the Viennese company, to evacute -- or evacuate with them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and also I refused on the grounds that I don't want to leave my <span class="REGION">motherland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">I felt, why to endanger on my life now, towards the end.</sentence><sentence id="127">I didn't expect the terrible anti-Semitism which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="128">So I decided not to take any chances, but to stay put in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">But nights, I always was contemplating if -- what</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="133"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0054 6 should I do?</sentence><sentence id="134">What is the right thing to do?</sentence><sentence id="135">To run to the Russian oc -- and now conquered, liberated territories.</sentence><sentence id="136">And one thing, I don't know if it's important.</sentence><sentence id="137">Well, I -- I learned that I'm a little psychic.</sentence><sentence id="138">My dreams towards the end of the war were that I meet friends.</sentence><sentence id="139">Some friends embraced me, kissed me, were very happy to see me.</sentence><sentence id="140">My dearest friend, my childhood swee -- Julia Logbel, she pushed me away from her all the time.</sentence><sentence id="141">I couldn't understand this, this was in my <span class="NPIP">dreams</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">After the war, I found out that the people who pushed me away, like Alec Lamenstor, for example, my boyfriend who wanted -- we became fiance, he pushed me away, they were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="143">Unbelievable.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="144">People that didn't survive pushed me away.</sentence><sentence id="145">And people who survived, even that there was not so closed, and I didn't think about them, survived.</sentence><sentence id="146">And I met them after the war, and then I told them, "I knew you were alive, because you aka -- embraced me, you greeted me."</sentence><sentence id="147">So, this was the situation, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Did you -- did you feel at the time when you dreamt it, did you interpret it then as a rejection, or did you interpret it as --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: No, at first rejection.</sentence><sentence id="150">I cried, I -- I felt very badly, and I used to say, "I didn't do anything wrong, why do you push me away?"</sentence><sentence id="151">Like my best friend -- no, I didn't rationalize, only later, when I met, then I understood that this was the reason.</sentence><sentence id="152">So this is just before the liberation, and naturally I had to be double cautious.</sentence><sentence id="153">One way it was easier for me, because according to my assumed things, and false papers, because I was born supposedly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, I was safer, because if I was caught na -- in -- in this period, first thing they checked with the parish and police.</sentence><sentence id="154">The parish was already in the Russian</sentence><sentence id="156"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0054 7 hands.</sentence><sentence id="157">And, on the police, I had a legitimate cancarte made out on the fa -- a-assumed name, but they didn't know it, and the s -- false baptismal paper.</sentence><sentence id="158">So I was safer in this respect, but still I had to be very, very careful.</sentence><sentence id="159">I had many incidents.</sentence><sentence id="160">Like after Myrader and hama -- this beton [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="161">I -- after they evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="162">So I was referred to organization Torte, which built the -- you know, [inaudible] th -- they built -- to protect, you know, <span class="DLF">ditches</span>, <span class="DLF">ditches</span>, to protect the armies, and to slow down the onslaught of the approaching enemy.</sentence><sentence id="163">And my boss wanted me to evacuate with them, too.</sentence><sentence id="164">I refused.</sentence><sentence id="165">But there was one employee, an a-accountant.</sentence><sentence id="166">He himself looked Jewish too, German, ricedeutsch.</sentence><sentence id="167">And he said to me, "Fraulein Felitsia, what do you celebrate, Sabbat?"</sentence><sentence id="168">I knew he recognized me, naturally I play dumb.</sentence><sentence id="169">Was still very dangerous period for me, very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="170">I -- another one -- when -- in the new company, a Ukrainian, who worked in the bookkeeping department, turned to another white Russian, and he said to him, "You know what?</sentence><sentence id="171">I suspect that Felitsia Mewashefsky is a Jewess."</sentence><sentence id="172">And he spoke it in front of the women with whom I lived, who was the daughter -- daughter-in-law of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the company was located.</sentence><sentence id="173">And the yow -- white Russian said, "Why do you go for her life?</sentence><sentence id="174">What did she do to you?"</sentence><sentence id="175">So there were some decent people, but still was very dangerous to the last moment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And then, in a very unexpected way, you met your husband to be.</sentence><sentence id="206">What -- what happened that -- that day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: You see, when I was the secretary of the company, Myrader am-and Krauss, my boss, Klammenchitch, who happens be -- was a -- a Yugoslavian German, married to the</sentence><sentence id="211">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0054 8 daughter of the owner of the Myrader Krauss do -- Myrader's daughter, and he -- when they were supposed to evacuate and I didn't -- I refused to join them, he came over to me, and he said, "Listen, those are the keys from the safe.</sentence><sentence id="212">We will be back about two thr -- three months.</sentence><sentence id="213">Meanti -- you will manage the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and you'll pay out the checks."</sentence><sentence id="214">He gave me the checks.</sentence><sentence id="215">Then he told me, "You will get some very important telephone call, and cooperate."</sentence><sentence id="216">But didn't explain what will be the phone call, from whom.</sentence><sentence id="217">Just after I think two or three days, I'm not exact -- so sure now, I got a phone call from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>'s commandanten, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow military camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">And he ha -- just identify if this is the company Myrader and Krauss.</sentence><sentence id="219">I said yavolt.</sentence><sentence id="220">And the command came, "Springen sie de zoilen."</sentence><sentence id="221">Now, the -- I didn't know anything about zoilen.</sentence><sentence id="222">I know -- knew only that my co -- the company built <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> a-around big <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">German office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I didn't know -- I saw the <span class="BUILDING">pyramids</span> like form on the main <span class="DLF">thoroughfares</span>, but I was not -- I-I-I -- informed, and I didn't know that this is the company our built, and those are the zoilen, but I connected immediately.</sentence><sentence id="224">Now, I had to think very fast.</sentence><sentence id="225">Had I been a German, I would have told them that they must do it themselves because my company evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="226">And then I said, "I can save this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> being ruined."</sentence><sentence id="227">A-And -- not that -- a-after all, it is a historic sto -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, but not that all -- all in the Poles, that they helped me to survive.</sentence><sentence id="228">But still, it is the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="229">And I was thinking also for -- I analyzed the danger what will be for me, not to tell them to do themselves, and being I was not the only one left in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">There was -- still was the lady Lydia Lu-Lublevska, the daughter-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="231">There was -- still was maintenance men, two chambermaids, and hi --</sentence><sentence id="233"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0054 9 they didn't ask me who was speaking, so I thought I am not endangering my life, because I can always deny receiving the phone call.</sentence></p></dialogue>
