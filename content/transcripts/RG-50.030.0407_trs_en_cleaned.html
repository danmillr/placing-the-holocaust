<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Not -- Not random, oh, I don't know, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="115">You know, but I remember it only -- recollect it only because of the fact that the father has such strange answers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: That was it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: When you went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I mean when he -- when you asked him there, you know, why isn't there a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire truck</span> stopping this, and he tells you to be quiet, was there any talk when you went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="123">None?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: No, wouldn't talk about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: No, huh?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yep.</sentence><sentence id="131">We got the feeling that he didn't want to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="132">He wouldn't talk about any politics at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">Certainly he had some contact to some representatives to the resistance movement, with one of the advisors of William Loishner, the [indecipherable] board visit him regularly.</sentence><sentence id="134">And we got aware only of the fact that he left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, he didn't receive th -- him in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and -- and everything was very secret, and -- and by that th-the kids got afraid there was something happening, and in [indecipherable] that was his conduct.</sentence><sentence id="135">And once, you know, I just picked up a sentence that was quite symptomatic, in German, that ronteheron in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> with an auchnie pas etou and so on.</sentence><sentence id="136">That means the people in the ministry down there wouldn't do either, you know.</sentence><sentence id="137">And certainly that reflected the situation as the German resistance, that they couldn't, in a way, use the governmental institutions to raise a resistance, because everything was Nazified, or -- or the administration was without any influence because the Nazi party had a -- a -- a bypass, or surpass them.</sentence><sentence id="138">That was the situation, but this is also a later [indecipherable] and a potential.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: And the other thing I remember were the -- two things I remember o-of the Nazi period.</sentence><sentence id="151">One is that it has a vidi -- visit of the famous historian, Freidich Meineker, who was known for his distance precision versus the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="152">But he visited us in the summer of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="153">Then the German troops had conquered the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aprole</span>, that was highest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">And after Meineker had left, Sunday the father said, "Ee, Meineker's proud of that."</sentence><sentence id="155">We couldn't get to that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="156">But cernly all the money was owned in some respects, nationalist that -- although he criticized the regime, on the other hand, he was proud of the merit of the German troops, while my father, as an also World War One officer, all the time was deeply skeptical of what was going on in the Soviet Union, because he could not believe that this would end other than in a defeat.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Your dad was not a member of the party?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: He was a member of the party, he was --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: He was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: -- in 1940, he got a -- the -- the pressure of the district leader Karvitski that he should end the party, and then he was taken into the party, but pre-dated to 1937, but he, in a way, he came very late to the party.</sentence><sentence id="171">But you know, the party membership, as such, hasn't much meaning about what the people really thought of.</sentence><sentence id="172">And we have a lot of nominal members in that time.</sentence><sentence id="173">He had some problem, because he was a liberal historian, in the one paid he was a democrat, and in the -- 1943, he suddenly got some pressure that he would have to leave that <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and -- and it was very difficult round then, there were somehow people in the education ministry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, who helped him, by that he could preserve his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">But he lost the <span class="BUILDING">periodical</span> he was editing and he -- his -- it was a ri -- way politically minored, and he would have liktus every day of that, everything was gone, and by that, he was in a bit di-difficult position, but he tried to adapt himself to a certain extent.</sentence><sentence id="175">Certainly that is what raise him to manifold that group who was not really conservative.</sentence><sentence id="176">And er -- which on the other hand, you know, lost the confidence in the restoration, or the continuation of the parliamentary democ -- democratic system.</sentence><sentence id="177">There was some disorientation.</sentence><sentence id="178">Certainly, he was strongly directed against the prevailing tendency of the so called Reich mythology, and he still was very strong in pressing for the importance of the Bismark in tradition, so that that was a little bit directed against the great German tendencies.</sentence><sentence id="179">And so far he had a peculiar position, but he was -- he was not really a member of the opposition.</sentence><sentence id="180">He was in the midst between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="181">And in a way he also had to fear that he got political pressure again, as it happened then, in 1944, I'll never forget then the famous Gunter Franzel was the historian for the peasants who were in the Third Reich, came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassburg</span> had been lost, and now we were sitting at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">So they had, years ago, a while been SS, and now my father's and -- said that he was just as helm, and I -- I never forget that the father was way, way for -- fearful that they wanted to get his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">It looked like they had, you know.</sentence><sentence id="185">And then I met the same Franzel five months later, after the break down of the regime, you know, in another uniform, and a -- the way, free, different type, you know there you see the change.</sentence><sentence id="186">I never forgot that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="187">And so far, I think the position of my father's was a bit precarious, but he was now a hero.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: And your -- your two older brothers, were they brought into the army in deg39, or later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well, my o-oldest brother, certainly he was brought into the army with 18, and then he served all the time, first in -- in the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>, and then in <span class="REGION">Africa</span>, but he -- fortunately he didn't get to <span class="REGION">northern Africa</span> because there end of the main -- because then -- there was everything finished.</sentence><sentence id="209">And then he went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, and he survived in a way because he -- in April 1947, fled, and swam through the er -- <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Oude river</span> in order to get into the hands of the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="210">That was that story.</sentence><sentence id="211">So the -- he had the pressure 0 -- you know, of being all the time a soldier at the front, and he was also ma -- sa -- two times wounded, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="212">That way, typical war -- war age cahount.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: And the younger one, he went in -- first was what you call in German fleckhaffer, that means he had to -- to serve as a suen in the entire air company, and then later on, he also got soldier, and -- but he was younger, and in a way -- he didn't get to the Soviet Union, but to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And you know, that's a really strange story, because when he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlevig Kolchda</span>, that's in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, that was a region where still the great Admiral Doernitz had his.</sentence><sentence id="222">And there they dwell for two or three weeks, they preserved as independent military units, and what is fairly not known, that they had that, what one calls in German, Ate tu exetsianser.</sentence><sentence id="223">Exercise the great thing, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heil Doenitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">You know that Doenitz wanted to continue, instead of having the Heil Hitler, they now should use a Heil Doenitz, and that was -- is almost unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="225">And then he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with everything one wanted to have, because I know there was a lot of foot stuff.</sentence><sentence id="226">And [indecipherable] over there at that time, while the other came in <span class="COUNTRY">American</span> -- ga -- custody.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="228">Tell me about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during this period, when you started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">I know you have no comparison, because you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and it's in -- within the context of the National Socialism, but what was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: But it's strange, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was called <span class="BUILDING">Adolf Hitler school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Got the name after 1933.</sentence><sentence id="235">About the time I take -- round that <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we'd say <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, that was the second day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="236">It was one of the -- not of the old k -- <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, which have Latin and Greek in the center of the lessons, but they had modern languages, that was something, and mod -- more modern type of the <span class="BUILDING">German secondary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">And the -- the man who was running that, the director, he was definitely non -- a non-Nazi, that's quite clear.</sentence><sentence id="238">And he tried to avoid too much in indoctrination in that time.</sentence><sentence id="239">And I have the personal experience, I always warn people to overestimate the decree of ideological indoctrination a -- during the Nazi period.</sentence><sentence id="240">You know, that was very strong in the years after 1935, but later on, it was really German, Nationalists certainly, it was -- it was not liberal, it was not democratic.</sentence><sentence id="241">But I can't remember that there was any talk about -- about race, and racial ideology or so -- th-that would play a big role, and I remember it in the later war years, we had then a specific Nazi teacher, who came with a brown uniform, and so we had a [indecipherable] start, you know.</sentence><sentence id="242">It was not a -- the experience which then occurred after, in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="243">It's because they had the same men, and also after [indecipherable] and they had a way bad life, you can -- and that was, you know, not a serious type, he was way d -- he was, I think, really different from the other professors, you know?</sentence><sentence id="244">And it -- so far, I can't remember that there was a specific Nazi indoctrination in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Certainly some, you know, and well, you would have the -- the typical <span class="BUILDING">school</span> pil -- festivals or something, but I can't remember that we were sitting together to listen to the Hitler speech or something.</sentence><sentence id="246">Maybe that happened, but it was not very significant, I think.</sentence><sentence id="247">And as a historian, I add on the commentary, that after 1935, Goebbels in the way, certainly the propaganda on the one hand was very rapidly and tr -- especially in the Jewish case, but there was also some deportization of the whole system be -- if the citizens remained loyal, everything was not -- and -- and so far, I think the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not too much Nazified.</sentence><sentence id="248">And there was not too much change after -- in the teacher staff, after 1945, and certainly in 1944, we got a little bit more aware of the politic conditions and so on, but there was not much talk, and every f -- thing -- you had to be very busy all the time, and certainly we are -- spent every Sunday to have collecting this or that in the service, or the Deutsch yungfolk, the youth organization of the hi -- of the Hitler youth, or later on even in the Hitler youth.</sentence><sentence id="249">I th -- I think, well usually when people think the whole time is a time of interconnection, it's not so much.</sentence><sentence id="250">At least I didn't understand anything about the Jewish question before the war was over, then I learned a little bit about it before the -- I was very naive in that way, you know.</sentence><sentence id="251">So they -- we -- the difference was that the father wouldn't talk about politics at all, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: And that's what I have to say to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: No.</sentence><sentence id="262">So this was not so typical.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Se-Serious school teachers wouldn't use that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: Well, I decided on the one hand because we were influenced by Hans Roadface, who was running the -- the leading periodical, and also after I ta -- finished my Ph.D. there, I went into the Institute Ratied Catcheechta, that means the leading institute for contemporary history, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="873">And certainly wat -- and I was primary -- primarily in that business.</sentence><sentence id="874">But think that's not all, but it's very symptomatic for our -- our ca -- generation that they just we -- were preoccupied to learn why the father generation had accepted the rule o-of Adolf Hitler you know, that was -- was a pressing issue, and therefore, many of my fellow students would also deal with -- especially the Wimayears, in order to understand the seizure of power later on, then we would enter also the second phase of the regime, after 1934, and studied that.</sentence><sentence id="875">That is, I think a typical process.</sentence><sentence id="876">And the following generation then, would look into 19" century.</sentence><sentence id="877">What are the basic reasons for the German way -- for the deformation of German politics.</sentence><sentence id="878">That was when, signified by the so-called <span class="BUILDING">Beedafeld school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: And how do you understand the -- th-the -- if -- if you could summarize the sort of historiography of what's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and how historians are trying to understand the Nazi era.</sentence><sentence id="887">Are there very clear demarcations as you see them, in how people are studying this, and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="890">A: Well, the deka -- a lot of <span class="DLF">demarcation lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="891">In our first [indecipherable] you know, in the early post-war, those people who dealt with that, even in journalism, or 1-in history, certainly professional historians had a apprehension against -- to doing contemporary history, they did that on account of some sort epilaga -- epilagactic position, you know.</sentence><sentence id="892">And then they have the dichotomy between the SS state on the one hand, you know, the suppression, the police state, the apparatus, and on the other hand the German resistance, which we call the other <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and in the midst were also some people, but you know, this tule -- this picture was a way [indecipherable] one.</sentence><sentence id="893">And that was mixed then with the 1 fear of totalitarian dictatorship, and the idea of the molithic structure of the regime, and the predominant role of Adolf Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="894">That was the old position, which I think was prevailing in through the middle -- into the end of the 60's.</sentence><sentence id="895">Now there happened one change that the American government returned the captured German files in 1967.</sentence><sentence id="896">And our generation of [indecipherable] had the first time the opportunity to look really into the files, and not only in the selected documents, which we are typical for the Nuremberg trials, or living from memoirs of contemporaries and witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="897">We looked into the files, and we got a very different picture than that of the monolithic state, and so all the contradiction within a system, and that's why the -- but then developed it -- a quite different understanding of how the regime functioned then.</sentence><sentence id="898">For instance, Hans Roadface or Caldidish baha [indecipherable] older generation.</sentence><sentence id="899">And they also -- the so-called <span class="BUILDING">Functionalist school</span> emerged.</sentence><sentence id="900">I belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Functionalist school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="901">I would certainly point it out that it -- it not sufficient only to look at the ideology on the one hand, and to -- to say that Hitler wrote his program down in the Mein Kampf, and then everything happened like that, it's nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="902">And that is also a apologetic element, just to put Hitler in the foreground all the time, because -- and our function was to show that the responsibility of what had happened, had to be put on broader sco -- shoulders, and that was, over there, some mechanisms of the -- the one hand, the -- the style of politics, and the perception of politics, which was specific Fascist, and a specific structure, which put Jews then what I call cumulative radicalization, which may explain the proceedings, or the -- the way Nazi policy took, and t -- that can be especially, I think shown with respect to the Jewish persecution.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="930">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="932">A: -- and especially the Israelis, because certainly the Israelis also have that -- that [indecipherable] reason for that one-ness that the -- the Israelian historiography has been developed by German professors who were mainly representatives of the history of ideas.</sentence><sentence id="933">That has been continued by men like Talman, and the others, I know them, you know?And certainly also the background of the Jewish religion is very favored for history of ideas, you know.</sentence><sentence id="934">But that, yeah they have still today, problems to -- to do a simple social 2 history.</sentence><sentence id="935">But mainly they are -- they are working in history of ideas.</sentence><sentence id="936">Therefore, they have one bias in that direction.</sentence><sentence id="937">Secondly, you know, the strong connection between notion of the creation of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and the role anti-Semitism stands in the background.</sentence><sentence id="938">And so had sa -- the survivors, they have problems, I can understand that, to -- to accept what already was a conflict with Hana-ah, and to accept the trivial elements in that policy.</sentence><sentence id="939">It's very, very comprehensible that they don't want to have these very trivial elements as elements of explanation, and -- and so forth, the Functionalists have a difficult time if they talk to those people.</sentence><sentence id="940">Although we say one can't explain everything where the ideological factor, or the personal factor Hitler, and they have to put in that element of bureaucratic competition, and so on, and no -- but you know the whole -- whole controversy between Functionalists and Intentionalists is coming to an end, you know.</sentence><sentence id="941">Eruda Bower says that, and -- and sometimes Karl Hiberg would say that he is a Structuralist, and -- and what Chris Browning did in writing the [indecipherable] 101, he suddenly got a -- got a notion that it wouldn't work with the Intentionalist explanation, which he originally had, you know, I never forgot, and that was [indecipherable] debate with them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="942">At that time, he was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="943">But today, most of the researchers in a way of taking up our Functionalist -- Functionalist elements of explanation, and everybody gets aware that Hitler was not a man who was -- had -- had that [indecipherable] personality, you know, that this was a merth, and that things are even more -- were even worse, because there are many people who -- who pushed the process, I think, atafond, and certainly this viewpoint increases a responsibility, and a moral responsibility of the nation, versus a specific Nazi perpetrators, you know.</sentence><sentence id="944">And my generation, we fought against that position, that there are only very few people besides of Himmler, and [indecipherable] Hitler, that they -- seduced, is the term.</sentence><sentence id="945">For fear they seduced the German nation, you know.</sentence><sentence id="946">That was your -- the main argument.</sentence><sentence id="947">And we started to -- just to get rid of that crazy idea, I wanted to show how that could happen, I certainly -- that was, and still is our question, how could that happen?</sentence><sentence id="948">And certainly I would argue then -- your argument -- I can't go to the next generation and say there was some stupid, crazy individual called Adolf Hitler, that's why they killed five million Jews.</sentence><sentence id="949">I don't think that this is sufficient.</sentence><sentence id="950">It seems to be real plausible, but then it's not plausible by -- because why could one man do that?</sentence><sentence id="951">And so on, we're -- in a way we have to describe the background on which Hitler could then have that function.</sentence><sentence id="952">And so far, I think in the fear -- the misunderstanding of both <span class="NPIP">fronts</span>, I think have overcome.</sentence><sentence id="953">There's just the next polarization between younger historians who want -- who would go back to some ideological explanation, said as Uri Shalbud, and the other ones who were some experience and say, well, you will have the same development as we had at -- that he originally stud-studied all the time, the Nazi [indecipherable] longer, and we got a idea that it's not so important.</sentence><sentence id="954">Certainly there was a basic anti-Jewish resentment, no question, but that there had been other mechanisms we share, what then may explain the perversion of a civilicized nation into a -- a apparatus of criminals, and that is still the problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1133">A: Well, I wouldn't overestimate the impact of national history on the process, but certainly there is something like a -- a -- the -- well -- that has been called by -- from the authoritarian character, and the authoritarian character plays a role, I think, f -- to fulfill the expectation by the Nazis and by Hitler, you know, th-they then just did, and you can see that with their example, the Reich's Crystal Night, and all the -- the German population protested way much against the violent acts in the night of the ninth of November already, and the eighth, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1134">But then the Gestapo gave the explicit order that they should take into custody 20, or 20 thous -- 25,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1135">That was a state measure, they accepted that, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1136">This is a strange element.</sentence><sentence id="1137">Law and order can work under certain conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1138">That they criticize the Nazi policy, but in -- then also can support Nazi policy.</sentence><sentence id="1139">And in a way it did, especially if you look how they then proceeded in getting these European Jewry from the last isle in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, or elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1140">You know, it's really nonsense, nobody would have done that in the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="1141">In that respect I think it's uniquely German.</sentence><sentence id="1142">Maybe the Russians, and some people there have a -- have some heritage from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to do that in their day, if they start then to bring it to a -- toa -- I think complete, and that's, I think one specific element.</sentence><sentence id="1143">But, on the other hand, we're starting to study what the French police did, and maybe they count a very depressing results [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1168">Q: [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: That means a half, quarter, and so on, Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1171">And Heydrich invited the ministers to the Wannsee conference, to decuss -- discuss that issue, and to get approval of the ministries, and the Reich chancellor, which were involved.</sentence><sentence id="1172">In order then to press on Hitler, to get the approval to include the half Jews, and the Jews living in mixed marriages.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And Hitler at that point was a -- was something like a brake.</sentence><sentence id="1174">Certainly motivation is very clear, he -- he didn't change -- want to change in later years, anything, and he thought it terribly inp -- unpopular if he would touch the assimilated Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And he was less strict in that issue than Heydrich, and Himmler and others.</sentence><sentence id="1176">That gives to the Wannsee conference certainly, quite a new meaning, and Eichmann, who was expert on the mishlings question, that means the question of half and quarter Jews, he wanted to di -- let disappear his role.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And by that, he over -- he pointed at the ongoing liquidation in that famous speech delivered by Heydrich, wh -- and now -- by now we know very well that Heydrich had in mind what was going on with the construction of that so-called rollbarn defore, that was a big <span class="DLF">street</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And from there he had a -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish labor camps</span>, and where he practized quote unquote, annihilation through labor, and that is then mentioned in this speech by Heydrich.</sentence><sentence id="1179">Because 20 days later he would, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, still talk about all the deportation, all the 11,000,000 Jews -- European Jews, to the <span class="REGION">Icemeer region</span>, where the Gestapo wanted to have a -- it's own <span class="REGION">territory</span>, and a continuing the archy period in the <span class="BUILDING">gulag</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1180">You know, that was really simple.</sentence><sentence id="1181">But in the ensuing weeks, suddenly everything changed, and then they did not he-hesitate then, to implement the systematic liquidation of the European Jews, but not so much at the Wannsee conference.</sentence><sentence id="1182">And you know, and so far, still the central part of that history, opened to different interpretations by now, but certainly that doesn't change anything in the very terrible development, and the criminal character of that, but it makes it, I think, a bit more comprehensible.</sentence><sentence id="1183">And certainly the problem still is that -- that it's not only Hitler who is doing that, certainly he's supporting that all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1184">The discussion is to what extent Hitler was informed.</sentence><sentence id="1185">Certainly I -- I wouldn't say that Hitler was not, but on the other hand, he didn't want to know too much.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And therefore, there was not too much discourse between the underlings and him, Hitler, as everybody assumed.</sentence><sentence id="1187">But the -- obviously that was not necessarily the case.</sentence><sentence id="1188">Hitler was living in the ideological world, he all the time was characterized by a flight from reality, and he was not a man who looked at things day to day, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1189">That was a original position when I started that business of Nazi history.</sentence><sentence id="1190">Well, is that some sufficient explanation of your question?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1538">Q: How do you account for that?</sentence><sentence id="1539">I mean, what do you think about these diaries?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1542">A: Well, the diaries are very impressive, especially for those youngsters, and for those students who want to realize how the living condition of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and posey with other parts of Europe at that time, really were.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Certainly he is living in a mixed marriage, that's -- a mixed po -- the -- Polish marriage.</sentence><sentence id="1544">By that, he even certainly has better conditions than the average Jews, that's quite clear.</sentence><sentence id="1545">But anyhow, what gets -- what gets a vivid, I think, picture of how -- what the Jewish situation in Nazi Germany was.</sentence><sentence id="1546">And that's helps for the youngsters, I think, to understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1547">S -- You know, for the first time, they get an interpretation of Jews, and Jewish life, and how they had, or tried to survive, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1548">And because it's translated by a man who belongs to the m -- basically to the German culture, and so on, it's obviously easier to understand that, anyhow, that belongs to that new wave of sensitivity towards the Jewish question, which also was to be seen in the "Schindler's List" film.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1556">Q: When -- When you read the diaries, and you think back upon your saying about yourself that you were naive.</sentence><sentence id="1557">Now, I understand you were a child, and he was an adult person, so I'm not trying to compare your naivete, and his la -- so-called lack of it, but it was fascinating to me how much he figured out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1562">Q: Even given where he was.</sentence><sentence id="1563">It seems really extraordinary.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1566">A: Well, that's right, yes, but I must atsee as a child I didn't -- I didn't hear that at the -- and -- and -- and I think in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, that didn't -- that didn't occur too much.</sentence><sentence id="1567">At least I don't know, you know, I --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1570">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1572">A: -- and, d'you know, when I was growing up, in order to see something, you know, the Jews had disappeared to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, there was nothing left, and by that, I'm a bad witness in that respect.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1576">Q: But it is interesting to see those diaries, because it's clear that if you were adult person, and you would take the information that was coming in if you thought about it, which is what you said before, if you actually thought about it, you -- you'd know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1578">A: That's right, or at least know what the general direction was like.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1592">A: An explana -- no, it's -- it's not an explanation of the attitudes of the population, you're right, but it's an explanation of how the isolation came into being, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1610">Q: So, can you tell me what you think is so problematic about this use of the word, uniqueness, and what it -- what it destroys.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1612">A: I wouldn't say it's problematic, but you know, if I study historical events, I don't study them for their u-uniqueness, but in order to learn from that, to have a better understanding of comparable, or prospeels, or opposite situations.</sentence><sentence id="1613">And by that, that category of uniqueness is not very variable, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1614">And, well certainly there is an u -- u-uniqueness 6 insofar as this systematic liquidation of millions of people in the 20" century.</sentence><sentence id="1615">It's incomparable to other developments.</sentence><sentence id="1616">But I'm -- I'm always a bit cautious for what -- what uniqueness can mean, you know -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="1617">Or, the other day I have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yucatan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1618">What [indecipherable] with those populations.</sentence><sentence id="1619">Well, it took them a century or two, the Germans did that within two years.</sentence><sentence id="1620">That is maybe the uniqueness, that means our century.</sentence><sentence id="1621">But the size of killing whole people, they maybe not so ni -- u-unique if you take in comparison to size of populations today, and in earlier periods.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And so far, I would also have a principle objection to use the term unique, because in a way, we don't much about what is really unique.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1634">Q: We don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1636">A: We don't know much about, compare -- well, history is a very broad business, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1668">Q: Let -- Let me push this uniqueness just a little bit, be-because I -- there are certainly debates about -- and you take it on, though not in these terms.</sentence><sentence id="1669">The Holocaust is about the Jews, the Jewish experience is unique.</sentence><sentence id="1670">And then there's a -- a view that there's a 7 universal way to look at the Holocaust, that there are many victims during the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1688">A: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Iceberg</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1689">And I mentioned that, at a talk to -- and now I got about the resettlement policy, you know, it's quite the -- after -- there was some compensation mechanism which [indecipherable] at first met the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1690">And suddenly they are the -- the prejudice, and anti-Judaism, and not only a distinct anti-Semitic philosophy was responsible, that the selection was then made, and a lot of other factors.</sentence><sentence id="1691">But that - in -- in the long run, that wouldn't have been an isolated phenomenon, they would have killed other groups, also.</sentence><sentence id="1692">So th -- it was in a way, to put it in question marks, the easiest to kill the Jews, because they didn't get opposition from their local populations, and you know, and you know, and you know.</sentence><sentence id="1693">But the tendency to kill other <span class="NPIP">groups</span> as well, is unmistakably t-there.</sentence><sentence id="1694">And it so far, you know, you can say there was a uniqueness on their -- within the general picture, there was something like a uniqueness, like maybe kind of ca -- try to put that in that way.</sentence><sentence id="1695">And there is something which certainly explains that the -- the Jews were killed foremost, and the others anyway survived, although killing processes were underway all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1708">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1709">There is a way in which -- when I read your stuff, and I think about reading other people's material, that one gets the feeling that Nazism is either self-mutilating or suicidal, that in the end it would eat itself up with death.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1712">A: That's my thesis, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1713">So now, in the last months of the -- of the war, you know, they suddenly said, we don't need only racial homogeneity, we need only political homogeneity, and started to kill everybody in this time, 10 thousands of Germans, either, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1714">And then so far, you know, that was symptomatic for that form of -- of -- that style of politics.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1726">Q: Tell me what you think about the emergence of movies like "Schindler's List", and television films and this sort of spate of popularization of the Holocaust, after years of a lot of people not thinking about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A: Well, usually historians are very critical, I'm not.</sentence><sentence id="1729">I think "Schindler's List" is quite a good film, and I think the historical data are mainly, I think, reliable.</sentence><sentence id="1730">One can talk about some interpretations here, but in general I think it helped to understand the process in the minds of many youngsters in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And well, it doesn't replace the historical work, which is certainly more abstract, and less simple, but on the other hand, I think it was more helpful than the documentary films we had in the -- in the 50's and 60's, which didn't left an imprint on the German mentality, or at least not too much.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1738">A: Landsman's "Shoah" is different, but you know, Landsman's "Shoah" has something for a few intellectuals who will sit there for 24 hours, I don't know how long that is, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1746">A: You know, that's not symptomatic for a -- for the public.</sentence><sentence id="1747">It's very impressive, you know, and [indecipherable].</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1750">Q: A-As an historian, is it an odd phenomenon that the farther one seems to get from this event, the more interest there seems to be, or is there deep -- how -- do you understand what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="1751">I mean, they -- there may --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1754">A: I don't understand it very well, you know, we have an interchannel change, and suddenly we have a generation which starts, and you -- well, it goes a whole way.</sentence><sentence id="1755">We did, as historians, starting with the ideas, and turning back to issues they don't know -- want to know that.</sentence><sentence id="1756">And it's so forth they have, and -- and fairly increased interest in the second World War, and the Jewish issue, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1757">Among the younger students today, and that's quite a phenomenon, and -- but it has to be interpreted in terms of interchannel change.</sentence><sentence id="1758">Do you know, after those generations have left <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, or the positions who was -- who were in this or that kind involved, now the next generation wants to know, and to provide information and -- and that -- start anew, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1770">A: Well, not necessarily, but that's certainly connected to that, that we have that phenomenon in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which I think it's really remarkable.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1798">A: Well, [indecipherable] books on that, d'you ever read them?</sentence><sentence id="1799">You know, and I found it very interesting, the -- the recent book by Ted Hurwitz his name, on the -- on the miterzation of the Holocaust, you know, and he brings that interpretation that they want to put a positive meaning by stressing the Americans as liberators, and so on, in comparison to what is going on in wa -- Yad Vashem, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1800">Well, from a German viewpoint, that is -- that's not very convincing.</sentence><sentence id="1801">And I -- I always told that story that a Germans wanted to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the resistance movement, but unfortunately that is too anti-Semitic [indecipherable] to wage that -- at --idea, you know, but that was very symptomatic.</sentence><sentence id="1802">But we don't have the possibility to connect the -- that, even to bend with 0 some sort of suppositive national tradition, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1803">That's it's -- has to do with what I told you about, the emergence of a new consciousness.</sentence><sentence id="1804">We just can't [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1805">At least the other <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> resistance no -- we have done five people, or 50, that's not enough, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1806">It's not representative.</sentence><sentence id="1807">And then so far, sh -- from a German viewpoint, you look at that as certainly a bit skeptically with all the politish and nutson went on the attendance to -- to have some general consequential slogans, or what do you say, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1808">We are far more skeptical as -- us Germans who went through that experience.</sentence><sentence id="1809">But anyhow, it's a very impressive exhibition, and is a -- is a very, very good and interesting material, in many respects, but it would be [indecipherable] to say that a most impressive <span class="NPIP">place</span> is where you have the pictures of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, what's the name?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1826">Q: [indecipherable] yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1828">A: But that would be also the reaction of the -- of the German yosterday, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1829">Because that's like "Schindler's List", or that's the Klemperer diary.</sentence><sentence id="1830">It shows the people again, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1831">And what is our task as historians, is to -- not to -- well, the people should stay alive in the whole description of the process, that's difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And that is done, in a way, by the exhibition.</sentence></p></dialogue>
