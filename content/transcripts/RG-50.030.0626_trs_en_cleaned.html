<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: No, that was the thing you see.</sentence><sentence id="40">We were relatively well-off, and also terribly conservative economically.</sentence><sentence id="41">So, we had no debt, and never borrowed from anybody for anything, and the result is that we were relatively well off when things went awry.</sentence><sentence id="42">But, there was a fund, of course, for the future, for my education [indecipherable] and that suddenly disappeared, because they knew that my father was mortally ill, and we were going to have to take over in some fashion, and this is -- this would be very dis- disorganizing, as it was.</sentence><sentence id="43">And so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Did he -- excuse me -- did he have his own business, your father?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: No.</sentence><sentence id="48">He worked for somebody else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: He worked for the New York state transportation department, and his own job had to do with train wrecks.</sentence><sentence id="52">When -- when there was an accident, they had a team that went out and tried to find out why it happened.</sentence><sentence id="53">And he was very good at that business, I guess, because he went right through from -- he was a very young man, almost an office boy when he arrived, and worked his way up.</sentence><sentence id="54">And the thing is, he had no education either.</sentence><sentence id="55">He -- he was born in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, and he went to the good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">I guess you would say he was a very ambitious man, and he read all the time, and that was a great</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="60">influence for me.</sentence><sentence id="61">He had me reading Dickens and Dumas when I was nine and 10 years old, but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: That's pretty impressive.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Well, if you starting at the right end --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: -- you know, for instance -- well, I guess it was Robert Louis Stevenson, it was -- was the start of my foreign education, and -- what was it, the -- "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treasure Island</span>" was the first book.</sentence><sentence id="66">So, he very carefully chose the books to be at a level where I could understand, hopefully, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Were you his only child?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Pardon me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Were you his only child, or did you have br --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: No, no, there was a girl after me.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: So you're the oldest.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Well, I was -- I was the eldest, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="75">And well, at any rate, I --I got a piece of education from reading, and I -- the reading habit I got into, and had occasional troubles with my schoolteachers because they didn't think that the family should race ahead of this program, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curriculum</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: So, at any rate, he was a wonderful old man, and -- but he -- he got very, very sick.</sentence><sentence id="84">Heart can -- heart condition, and we knew he wasn't going to be around a long time, so we had to prepare for this.</sentence><sentence id="85">And the preparation did not include any possibility of going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Because not only did we not have enough money to cover that, but I knew that with a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education, at that time when jobs were very scarce, I didn't have much of a chance.</sentence><sentence id="92">So -- but I did have an interest, and the interest was in journalism, which actually I developed in the <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And before I got out of <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, I had an idea, I--I had a-- I wa -- a little play friend, the -- these correspondences with children from other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Oh, pen-pal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Yeah, one of -- one of my teachers went to, of all <span class="NPIP">places</span>, <span class="REGION">western Australia</span>, which is just -- just about west of anything in the wor -- in the world.</sentence><sentence id="100">And so I-I got the -- my friend sent me the local paper -- matter of fact, all of the local papers.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I noticed that one was a weekly, which looked more like an American paper than any of the others.</sentence><sentence id="102">There was the lingering influence of the British journalism, with the ads on the page one and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="103">This was different, this had headlines on page one [indecipherable] news on page one.</sentence><sentence id="104">And I was really intrigued by this.</sentence><sentence id="105">And I had already started my self-education, read every book that had to do with journalism.</sentence><sentence id="108">don't know whether I understood it or not, but at any rate, I did that.</sentence><sentence id="109">And -- and then one day I got the notion that maybe these people out in poor old <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, would like to have a correspondent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Not a bad notion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: And I noticed that they had a regular correspondent in -- in <span class="REGION">Asia</span> who traveled around.</sentence><sentence id="125">And then they had another correspondent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, which was home to the Australians.</sentence><sentence id="126">And so these were very special needs.</sentence><sentence id="127">One was, of course, the local aspect, of the -- of news, and the other was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">And -- but I said th -- I-I decided to write a letter to the editor.</sentence><sentence id="129">So I went to the British -- the -- I don't read it any more, but oh, I can't remember the name of it.</sentence><sentence id="130">At any rate, it's -- was -- it's a -- it's a British publication, similar, but rather more serious than the World Almanac for -- that we have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: The Economist?</sentence><sentence id="139">Would it be the Economist?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No, no, the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: No?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: -- no, no, no, this i-- no, no.</sentence><sentence id="145">No, it says -- A2: You mean like the encyclopedia.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Sure, it's got the name of a -- of a the -- research publication, but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: I see, okay.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: But at any rate, it was the one place where they had all of the editors by name, everywhere in the British commonwealth.</sentence><sentence id="152">And so I thought, well, in the British commonwealth, they speak English, and that's the only thing I can speak, so I wrote them a letter and I said, I am a student of journalism.</sentence><sentence id="153">No mention of grade, age, anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="154">So, I had the -- and I followed my father's rules.</sentence><sentence id="155">He said, when you write a letter, you keep it on one page, if you possibly can, because you lose the reader on the second page.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Absolutely right.</sentence><sentence id="162">Absolutely right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: And so -- so I followed all the rules, and I used the simplest language, don't be fooled by the multi-syllable words.</sentence><sentence id="166">So I just said in plain English that I was a--a journalism student [indecipherable] without experience as of now, but I noticed their paper, and I noticed that they had correspondents in these other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and none in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">So would they be interested in taking me on, course free, as a correspondent.</sentence><sentence id="168">And I thought afterwards, what a stupid thing to do, you know.</sentence><sentence id="169">I consulted no one, and I got --I had the shivers afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="170">Then, in the normal turn of events, which between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and -- and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> is about two months, I got a letter back, and it was from the publisher, who said, you know, we are -- we are interested in you.</sentence><sentence id="171">We have to know a lot more about you, but then he said, let's consider it a possibility.</sentence><sentence id="172">And so I did, I-- I found the name of the editor of the publication: that was on the masthead of course, And I wrote him and sent him a very</sentence><sentence id="174">long article about the failure of the -- 0-o-of Roosevelt's policies.</sentence><sentence id="175">Because at that time, it were -- that was about 1937 was it, something like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you weren't even 20 years old?</sentence><sentence id="189">You were like 18.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Oh, oh, I was far from 20 years old.</sentence><sentence id="193">I -- I was [indecipherable] nothing man, I had -- had absolutely nothing, so -- so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: But chutzpah.</sentence><sentence id="195">A lot of chutzpah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Oh, a lot -- a lot of --a lot of gall.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: So, I'd like to turn this now to -- as you're speaking, a number of thoughts are going through my mind.</sentence><sentence id="199">When I've interviewed other people who were part of liberating forces, U.S. forces, most of them do not have the exposure that it sounds like you did, to news, to world events, to -- it-- to people who were different from yourselves.</sentence><sentence id="200">So one of the key questions that I often ask somebody is, before they even get to Europe, did you meet anybody who was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="201">Well, if you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, chances are you did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: You couldn't miss them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Oh yes, well, that's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish city</span>, almost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: And then my second question is, is that if you were interested in news and journalism, were you aware, even as a teenager, of the news coming out of Europe, of what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Oh, oh certainly.</sentence><sentence id="218">I was right -- I-- 1 was reading about Hitler, it seemed, when he first came up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: To power.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: [indecipherable] by -- what was his name?</sentence><sentence id="224">A famous, very arrogant guy, who seemed to win wars without thinking about it.</sentence><sentence id="225">A2: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.246876" long="13.768211">Hindenburg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.246876" long="13.768211">Hindenburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="231">A2: Talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.246876" long="13.768211">Hindenburg</span>, von Hindenburg.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Von Hindenburg?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="235">A2: Paul von Hindenburg.</sentence><sentence id="236">Paul von Hindenburg.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Paul von Hindenburg?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: That's right</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: And -- A2: The chancellor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: The chancellor, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="252">And so I a-- I was a con -- conscious of the growth of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="253">Actually, almost everybody was, but I read so much.</sentence><sentence id="254">I read internationally because I was interested in</sentence><sentence id="256">international affairs, but I was also -- I-I was taught at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you -- you're a man when you gu -- when you're born, and you use your brain from there on.</sentence><sentence id="257">And so it was a very good policy.</sentence><sentence id="258">And I had a mixed literary education, in that I -- there was "Tarzan of the Apes," which I also read, and the bi -- the -- was it the Hunter boys?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: A-Another series.</sentence><sentence id="270">And so here I was reading the classical 20" century -- or 19" century literature from Europe, in English, of course, translated, and then these other books, and enjoying them both.</sentence><sentence id="271">But at any rate, no, I was really up on the news in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="272">There were a lot of other <span class="NPIP">things</span> too, the same time, an awful lot of trouble there.</sentence><sentence id="273"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was having a terrible time.</sentence><sentence id="274">This was followed up by the other activities that are -- were very ominous in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">They were going after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchukuo</span> -- ma -- <span class="COUNTRY">Manchuria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And -- and in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> the Italians were trying to take over --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">So, it was a very disturbing time, interesting time.</sentence><sentence id="280">I can't say that I was scared by it.</sentence><sentence id="281">I was intrigued by it, and there was some very good books at the time coming out, various commentators; professional journalists wrote books.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Well, William Shirer, I think, was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> at the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Oh yeah, well I-- he was a giant in the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: --in the group.</sentence><sentence id="295">But at any rate, there was a great deal of concentration on the things that counted <span class="NPIP">abroad</span>, and also many of the problems at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">We had no military policy, and we were -- we were terribly weak at the time, and that was one of the big issues coming up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, how do we protect it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So I'd like to turn it back to, again, what you talked about earlier in your father, and his role in your education.</sentence><sentence id="301">And -- did these -- these events, these world events that you are talking about, not only in Europe but elsewhere, but of course for us it's particularly what was going on in Europe; were you discussing these at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: Oh yes, well, we -- we, of course, had dinner every night in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and it was a conversat-sational sort of sport.</sentence><sentence id="305">So we talked about everything, and sometimes when I wasn't old enough to know, I got instructed from the higher people, my mother and father.</sentence><sentence id="306">And yeah, you know, it was a -- it was a very good way to get educated, I think, without feeling the pain.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Yeah, it is.</sentence><sentence id="311">It is.</sentence><sentence id="312">To have got -- to have -- to have conversations around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> about important events of the day is something that doesn't happen that often any more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: There were a lot of people then, commentators on radio.</sentence><sentence id="317">There was one fellow -- what was his name?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="318">A2: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaltenborn</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaltenborn</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="323">A2: H-H.V. Kaltenborn.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="325">He was a -- and there was also a man who spoke so fast, we couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="326">So we turned him off.</sentence><sentence id="327">And Lowell Thomas, and you know, a lot of people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: The pretty -- pretty much accomplished journalists.</sentence><sentence id="335">And the -- and who could expound on a-anything.</sentence><sentence id="336">I think they had a little more freedom than they do today, because there are other people who popped up and said, you're wrong.</sentence><sentence id="337">And so that was a very good example of growing up in a democratic state.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: It was a-- it was a fine experience, and a lot of fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: So, did you write -- after that first article that you sent to the Australian newspaper, did you become their correspondent?</sentence><sentence id="347">Did you end up submitting pieces?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1761">A: And this was the other way.</sentence><sentence id="1762">These were the dregs.</sentence><sentence id="1763">These were -- these were not the people who were employed in [indecipherable] plants all through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or -- there -- there were a lot of commercial properties that were managed and run by these people.</sentence><sentence id="1764">Some fantastic stories about that, but seeing it is an emotional experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: We were all a little anxious, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="1803">We were doing very well, but when you're in a battle, if you're moving forward, you feel pretty good about that, but your -- you're further exposing yourself to doom.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And the -- I was -- I was not aware of -- of this sweep, but I knew it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And in fact, after -- after the Battle of the Bulge, our --</sentence><sentence id="1807">our -- our army -- 1 --I--I---I'm afraid I--I shouldn't say our army, I wasn't in the army, but I -- in that army, but because I -- of my personal experience.</sentence><sentence id="1808">But oh, the casualties were fearsome.</sentence><sentence id="1809">And the men who really fought have a different, instinctive feeling about it.</sentence><sentence id="1810">But our infan -- infantry really ch -- went through them so fast, that we had some surprises.</sentence><sentence id="1811">We overtook the -- the retreat of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1812">They'd retreat a while, then they'd surrender.</sentence><sentence id="1813">And so -- but as I say, in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> they got another picture of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1827">Q: What happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1829">A: Because they were -- these were civilians and -- and the Austrians that were in the army were, of course, in the German army.</sentence><sentence id="1830">And so they didn't have much to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1831">I know wa -- in our experience, the Austrian takeover was a cinch, after the fighting that we had done before.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1853">Q: So tell us about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1855">A: I-- we were -- we were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, in <span class="REGION">western Austria</span>, and I was -- I --I had attached myself to the -- to the intelligence section of the army.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And get -- got to know a very affable, probably 25 year old major who was working there too.</sentence><sentence id="1857">He was an infantry officer, a big man.</sentence><sentence id="1858">I -- apparently he certainly never showed any fear or anxiety under extreme pressure.</sentence><sentence id="1859">But at any rate, I reported in one day.</sentence><sentence id="1860">It was across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I was with ya -- with my infantry friends, and -- eating there and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1861">So I came in one morning, about eight o'clock I suppose, and there was this major whose name I can't remember -- and that's a shame, you know, that just -- should never forget the name of somebody who made such an impression.</sentence><sentence id="1862">But at any rate, he was a good -- good old boy, an Irish American, and he looked in his flushed face [indecipherable] and he looked very affable, friendly, took care of his non-coms and was very much appreciated.</sentence><sentence id="1863">So, he had come into the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> just before me, and he got a call from the director of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And the director said oh, he was very sorry, had to bother him</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1868">this way, but he heard about the -- the exchange of troops.</sentence><sentence id="1869">We had gone on the -- on the u-upper Austrian side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Donau river</span>, and had -- the Russians had moved in too far when we -- when we met.</sentence><sentence id="1870">There was a clerical error.</sentence><sentence id="1871">So that was passed.</sentence><sentence id="1872">The Russians were in that <span class="REGION">territory</span>, we didn't try to throw them out, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1873">But they were advanced maybe -- maybe a couple of miles on -- on what was supposed to be a straight <span class="DLF">line</span> of division.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And so they now -- now decided that they would settle all this at the very highest level.</sentence><sentence id="1875">Probably Patton himself participated, and they decided they'd better change this.</sentence><sentence id="1876">So they got together with the Russians and with perfect agreement on it, the Russians would pull back, and we would mo -- we'd move forward into that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1877">And when -- although we didn't know anything, or I didn't know anything, of course, let me say that when I say we don't know, that means I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1878">But at any rate, I didn't know there were planning to do this, they didn't consult me.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And so, both the major and I were very upset.</sentence><sentence id="1880">What happened was, when we first came in, the major went over to this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and talked to the director, who seemed to be a perfectly reasonable sort of person, to see were there kind of any pictures that were reputed to have been put there by Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="1881">And -- excuse --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1882">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1883">A: The director at that time said that no, there were no pictures, but that we could see that there were <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> where pictures had been.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And we didn't know what -- what wa -- happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="1885">So -- but nevertheless, any amount of questioning as the director,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1889">produced no answers.</sentence><sentence id="1890">And then of course, suddenly, the -- there came this change, and he discovered what he knew, or something, that the pictures were in a certain <span class="DLF">farm</span> wa -- in a-- ina <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, couple of miles in -- in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1891">And so he said --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1892">Q: Where the Russians were -- where the Soviets were.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1893">A: Yeah, right.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And he had -- he had the -- in fact, address.</sentence><sentence id="1895">He knew exactly how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="1896">He'd obviously checked somebody.</sentence><sentence id="1897">What they were, were cases, beautifully made, of wood, for each picture, whether it's small or large, and were beveled off so that they wouldn't hurt anything.</sentence><sentence id="1898">And he said, he se -- he was sort of apologetic because he knew he should have revealed this before.</sentence><sentence id="1899">Although I do -- I think if that had happened, what would happen is the Russians would have stiffened, and taken him away.</sentence><sentence id="1900">So we're probably lucky that this happened.</sentence><sentence id="1901">And -- and so, they --- "m-- I'm surprised they didn't have Russian guards on -- on these things.</sentence><sentence id="1902">But, at any rate --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1903">Q: Did he ask -- was his request to your Irish American major that -- that the Americans go and get his pictures back?</sentence><sentence id="1904">Was that what the request was?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1905">A: No, it was a sort of a-- a spontaneous reaction of idiocy by everybody there, you know, they -- they
