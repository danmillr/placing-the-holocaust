<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Can you tell us about your birth certificate?</sentence><sentence id="27">There was something unusual.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Uh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="31">As a matter of fact I, shortly after I was born, simply because it was safer, my parents had me convert to to Roman Catholicism.</sentence><sentence id="32">I became Roman Catholic and actually this shows on my birth certificate where the religion from Israeli was changed to Roman Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="33">On the old piece of paper it is still obvious that the change was made.</sentence><sentence id="34">It shows on the aged piece of paper where on the <span class="DLF">line</span> which shows religion, there's a sort of faint uh piece of, faint piece which shows that the the change was made there.</sentence><sentence id="35">Uh I was not brought up in a very religious way but uh after the war I attended uh religious classes with the other Roman Catholic kids in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, and this uh was the case until 1949, when uh religious classes were no longer compulsory at <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> because of the change in the government.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Did you know of being Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes, I knew I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="45">But uh my family was a family of non-practicing Jews.</sentence><sentence id="46">We were never very religious and therefore I was not brought in brought up in that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What do you recall of the Germans coming to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and how did that change your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, actually I didn't actually see the German soldiers come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">The way our life changed was that uh in late August of 1944, when there was a time of Slovak national uprising, my father was notified somehow by his friends that the situation is becoming more dangerous for Jewish people, and he was uh advised to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">Uh there was a small agricultural uh <span class="DLF">farm</span> associated with the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> where my father used to teach, and he was able to steal a horse and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, and he put the whole family on this with very few belongings and we went to one of his former acquaintances who was a farmer and who used to come to my father for advice and they somehow became friendly and my father considered this to be a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, at least in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="55">And this farmer, I don't recall his name, but this farmer had he had again some other friends, farmers further in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and that's where we were directed.</sentence><sentence id="56">I don't really recall how we got there but this was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">The farmers in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span> used to operate in such a way that their <span class="BUILDING">family homes</span> were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but their their <span class="DLF">farms</span>, their <span class="DLF">fields</span>, their animals, were further in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and they had a second <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there where they used to stay during the summer when they had to work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">Now we, the family of five now - my grandparents from my father's side and the three of us - went to one of these farmers with the family of Pavel Vancik and his brother Andrei Vancik.</sentence><sentence id="59">My father, my mother and myself, we stayed with the family of Pavel and my grandparents stayed on another <span class="DLF">hill</span> with the family of Andrei Vancik.</sentence><sentence id="60">We spent most of the time from September until, from September 1944 until uh April 1945 with these families, and we only in...only occasionally had to leave when it was more dangerous, it would be more dangerous for us to stay with the family.</sentence><sentence id="61">During those times we had to leave, we were helped by the family, Vancik family who took us further to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where they knew some lumberjacks who had their <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> there, and uh it was considered more more safe and uh more difficult to access by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="62">I remember one occasion when we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> which was situated very close to a nearby <span class="DLF">road</span> that a column of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army cars</span> loaded with German soldiers and pulling some other military equipment came close to this to this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and uh they were attacked by a group of three partisans.</sentence><sentence id="63">There was a short exchange of bullets and uh it ended up by killing these three uh partisans.</sentence><sentence id="64">I remember that uh when this all ended we we went to see these these dead bodies and the adults who were in our group actually buried these bodies very close by.</sentence><sentence id="65">Also, uh when this shooting ended, the Germans decided not to go any further into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh they were ready to leave, but the <span class="DLF">road</span> was very narrow and they had to turn this uh equipment and also the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> - there was one cannon which had to be turned, and uh during this process there were few minutes that the cannon pointed actually at the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where we all stayed.</sentence><sentence id="66">There were family, families, maybe three or four families, where there were also adults and children, and out of desperation I believe, the adults asked all the kids to line up in front of this small <span class="BUILDING">hut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Probably they wanted to make it pretty obvious that there are children there and wanted somehow to prevent the Germans somehow from from attacking us.</sentence><sentence id="68">Well, this probably worked because the Germans didn't actually shoot at us.</sentence><sentence id="69">They turned and then they left.</sentence><sentence id="70">But it was very dramatic.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: What are your recollections of your life in hiding?</sentence><sentence id="93">What was what was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like?</sentence><sentence id="94">How did you eat?</sentence><sentence id="95">What what was your daily life like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Well, this family, Andrei Vancik family and Pavel Vancik family, they the adults were about of the same age as my parents and they had kids.</sentence><sentence id="101">Uh I remember that there were some boys</sentence><sentence id="103">and some girls, but we were about the same age, so we spent our days in a in a very common way as probably any other families would would spend.</sentence><sentence id="104">Occasionally my father had to leave because there was some news uh coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that Germans were about to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to look for partisans, and at that time it would be dangerous for any man to be found because they would be uh either sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or if they were they would be found that they are Jewish then obviously they would be either shot on the spot or would be send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">In this way actually uh my cousin's father was shot in in front of his mother's and his own eyes because they were hiding somewhere and were caught by by Germans and he as a man found being Jewish was shot on the spot, and uh my cousin and my his mother was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" lon="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so you know in order for this not to happen to us, my father always left somewhere when we were notified that the Germans were coming.</sentence><sentence id="106">I remember one one occasion like this when I remember there was a heavy snow before, night night before, and uh he left to hide himself in the snow in the in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and when he came back several hours later, he was almost completely frozen.</sentence><sentence id="107">We had to somehow tub his uh body and uh try to somehow revive him.</sentence><sentence id="108">He must have had very a very strong constitution because I don't remember his getting sick or anything but I know that it was it was terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Did you have contact with other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villagers</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Well, yes.</sentence><sentence id="123">As a matter of fact uh it was a large family, these Vancik people people.</sentence><sentence id="124">We came into direct contact also with some other members of the family but I don't recall our going down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> actually.</sentence><sentence id="125">We stayed most of most of the time in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, so there was not much much contact with other people but some members of his family, of family, Vancik family occasionally showed up and we spent some time with them, but well there was not much social life.</sentence><sentence id="126">I can tell you that. (</sentence><sentence id="127">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: What else do you recall about hiding? (</sentence><sentence id="135">Pause) Do you remember any particular person especially who influenced you during that time? (</sentence><sentence id="136">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: I don't seem don't seem to recall anything. (</sentence><sentence id="141">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: What happened after that period of time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>?</sentence><sentence id="145">What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="146">Where did you go from there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: You mean after the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Yes, after after, right.</sentence><sentence id="153">What was the liberation like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: We were liberated in uh in 1945 uh in the Spring by the Russian Army; and I remember that uh with this army of Russians also a lot of Romanian troops came.</sentence><sentence id="157">They were probably supporting the Russians after...after the Romanian government uh turned against the Russians, uh against the Germans because it was pretty obvious that obvious and also convenient because uh it was obvious that the Germans are going to loose the war.</sentence><sentence id="158">After,</sentence><sentence id="160">right after the liberation, my father got a job with the new minin...newly formed Ministry of Agriculture and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klenowitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KoSice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">The first Czechoslovak government was set up there.</sentence><sentence id="162">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko'ice</span>, as the government moved to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">And that's where I actually got all my education, and I lived there until 1981.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: What was your life like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> as a Jew after the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Uh, well, I...as I mentioned before, I have not been brought up in a religious way.</sentence><sentence id="177">We were non-practicing.</sentence><sentence id="178">Uh my father was an idealist and a naive person in a way, because he believed that assimilation will help him avoid anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="179">And it may have worked to a certain point.</sentence><sentence id="180">Uh I remember that some of his older documents are still carrying his original name, Kohn, and some early documents like his uh wedding papers already carry his name, Kovac.</sentence><sentence id="181">Uh we have never belonged to any congregation, simply because we didn't want to be conspicuous.</sentence><sentence id="182">And I actually don't seem to recall anybody of the family going to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, ever - except maybe when some friends had a wedding there or that was probably the only time.</sentence><sentence id="183">When I remember I went to the one and only uh working <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">The other <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>, a very old beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, was never operating as far as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="185">It was used as a as a <span class="INT_SPACE">store room</span> for something and later it was also torn down when there was a construction of the new <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">Somehow that seemed to be the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to build a new <span class="DLF">bridge</span> so that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> could be torn down.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: How did you go on with your education at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: What was your <span class="DLF">field</span>?</sentence><sentence id="217">What did you study and how did you proceed in your career?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> you came here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, we were we immediately as we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, we first uh tried to, I tried to get a job either in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">This didn't work out because 1981 was a very bad year economically both in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and in Europe, and since I was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> before, that was my next choice.</sentence><sentence id="266">I have a distant cousin in <span class="REGION">California</span>, and uh with his sponsorship it was rather easy uh to get here within a relatively short time.</sentence><sentence id="267">We first went to <span class="BUILDING">HIAS</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and with their help we were able to take care of the formalities in a rather uneventful way.</sentence><sentence id="268">It took us only six weeks and we had our visas and were flown to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">I remember that with my with my cousin's friend uh help it took me only two weeks to get a job.</sentence><sentence id="270">It was not the best job, but it was a job and I could start working again as a chemist.</sentence><sentence id="271">I had a job with a small <span class="BUILDING">chemical company</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torrence</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">It was a very good experience for me, and this is how I first encountered private industry in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">But uh | always wanted to work in research because this is how I was trained.</sentence><sentence id="274">And uh luckily I managed to obtain this position at the National Institutes of Health; first as a visiting scientist, and later I was tenured.</sentence><sentence id="275">We became citizens of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1986.</sentence><sentence id="276">We applied five years to the day when we landed in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and it took about three or four months to get a citizenship then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experiences during the Nazi era?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Well, to make these things a little bit easier to understand why...why uh it happened only in 1944 that we had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, probably it would be good to mention that, in a way, we owe our survival until "44... It's...it's an irony, but we owe it to the Munich Pact.</sentence><sentence id="293">Because</sentence><sentence id="295">during that time - I mean, this was the...this was the way for the Slovaks to get their autonomy.</sentence><sentence id="296">When <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak Republic</span> was first cut into pieces, then the eastern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became an independent Slovak state; and this is what the Slovaks always wanted.</sentence><sentence id="297">They always felt oppressed by either Hungarians or the Austrians.</sentence><sentence id="298">And throughout several hundred years, they have never been independent.</sentence><sentence id="299">And uh they accepted, actually, this tragedy--the Munich Pact-- because this gave them the the opportunity to become independent.</sentence><sentence id="300">Hitler actually used Slovak state as a showcase.</sentence><sentence id="301">He showed the rest of the world that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which is actually under their command can be prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="302">And many educated people of Jewish origin were able to survive, because they were sort of indispensable.</sentence><sentence id="303">So they were exempt from, for example, wearing their David Stars-- which was normally an obligation for everybody who was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="304">I was able to attend <span class="BUILDING">public kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">My father was able to keep his job until 1944--September.</sentence><sentence id="306">Until after the Slovak National Uprising, when the things became more dangerous.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: And you had mentioned something about Jews fighting in the Slovak...the Slovak Army, even.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Well, this was another privilege sort of which the citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> of Jewish origin were granted, to serve in Slovak Army against the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="327">Actually my uncle, my father's brother, younger brother, died on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> as a member of Slovak Army.</sentence><sentence id="328">This is how the Germans wanted to show the rest of the world that they are treating everybody equal in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
