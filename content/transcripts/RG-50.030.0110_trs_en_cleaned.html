<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yah.</sentence><sentence id="34">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, actually, compared with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, it was a free country.</sentence><sentence id="35">I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> expecting a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">My parents had told me that it would be like this.</sentence><sentence id="37">But it turned out that life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was like living in a democracy.</sentence><sentence id="38">There was strike, there was economic hardship; and so as a child I was very much aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="39">Most of my friends were Polish boys from the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and so...And uh because there was strife between the German ethnic minority and the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="40">The usual fare was, you know, when we had children's dispute or so, my friends came up to me and said, "Tomorrow!"</sentence><sentence id="41">It meant actually they were mad at me; but they never came with a knife and cut my throat.</sentence><sentence id="42">I didn't expect them to either, you know.</sentence><sentence id="43">They didn't expect to do that either.</sentence><sentence id="44">So I got really right thrown into, you know, uh ethnic problems.</sentence><sentence id="45">And you get used to it.</sentence><sentence id="46">And uh you are not missing it necessarily, but you are not getting upset about it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="47">My mother is of Hungarian, Polish, and German descent, all three.</sentence><sentence id="48">The family came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> originally via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">And Frederick the Great took these Salzburg Germans into <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">That's where my mother landed.</sentence><sentence id="51">And the family mixed with Polish uh persons, and so she is a completely relaxed person.</sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is just...is not getting upset about anything.</sentence><sentence id="53">But already as a child I knew when a problem came up, she stepped right in and helped solving it.</sentence><sentence id="54">She never turned her back.</sentence><sentence id="55">My father same thing.</sentence><sentence id="56">I mean, I lived...I had the luck to be guided by the example of my parents.</sentence><sentence id="57">So it dropped out of me to you know, I mean any strife and so on, I am not necessarily personal mistakes solving problems, those problems, but sometimes it better to increase the problem and make it so bad that people see it once what a foolish thing it was, and they stop it.</sentence><sentence id="58">So I was a happy child.</sentence><sentence id="59">My father was a hunter.</sentence><sentence id="60">He went fishing.</sentence><sentence id="61">He was socially quite active.</sentence><sentence id="62">We had parties our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">Being a businessman in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> meant actually that you had your clients invite at least once or twice a year.</sentence><sentence id="64">Once at least for a big hunt.</sentence><sentence id="65">Uh, that's why my father really kept the <span class="DLF">hunting ground</span> to have a party opportunity to reward his customers.</sentence><sentence id="66">My father also became honorary consul of the German Weimar Republic, so as a businessman...And he served in this function, I think, until "29 or so.</sentence><sentence id="67">And, of course, he knew about the Nazi and didn't like anything of their stuff whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="68">Because of the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> things were discussed and the officers of the foreign service, they already indicated that Hitler will take over very soon.</sentence><sentence id="69">So the message of doom, at least for my father, was quite clear.</sentence><sentence id="70">It didn't...it took one incident.</sentence><sentence id="71">My father was riding by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And he, of course, used first class, and as a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="73">And another person came into his <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>--a German who traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, too--and after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move, this man opened his briefcase and took the Nazi Central Newspaper out, [the] Volkischer Beobachter.</sentence><sentence id="74">My father, seeing this...he didn't like the type of person anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="75">He looked like a reserve officer, had the bearing of a military man.</sentence><sentence id="76">He saw this, my father really angry.</sentence><sentence id="77">He took his briefcase from out of the rack and told this guy, "I don't want to share my <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> with a man who reads the Nazi paper."</sentence><sentence id="78">That's what the kind of person my father was.</sentence><sentence id="79">Because he addressed the right person.</sentence><sentence id="80">This person was actually his replacement.</sentence><sentence id="81">You know, he was on a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span> to talk to my father how he would take this over, you know.</sentence><sentence id="82">And later on, a day or two later, he met him.</sentence><sentence id="83">This guy came visiting and said, "I am Consul [Bernhard (ph)]."_</sentence><sentence id="84">And he...Of course, it was an icy meeting; and my father was relieved of his position in a week's time.</sentence><sentence id="85">This guy had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and wrote up the incident in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>; and that really fixed my father's future for good.</sentence><sentence id="86">My father, of course, didn't need that job at all.</sentence><sentence id="87">It was really uh more bother than reward.</sentence><sentence id="88">He ran his <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">But then the recession came and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very hard hit.</sentence><sentence id="90">My father was German citizen living on a passport.</sentence><sentence id="91">So the Poles said, "Mr. Kniiemann, why don't you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="92">That is what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was called in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And we got an order that our visas would not be prolonged, and that we had to leave by the end of 1932 to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">My father could have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span>; but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, really big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">And he had probably better opportunities to get a <span class="BUILDING">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">But he was in error.</sentence><sentence id="97">He came and he was told, "No job for you. "</sentence><sentence id="98">Because of his remark.</sentence><sentence id="99">And Hitler was not even in power then.</sentence><sentence id="100">But they already had...you know, the Nazis had already moved into strategic positions and already influenced the selection of people who could be hired or not.</sentence><sentence id="101">So my father never got a job offer.</sentence><sentence id="102">He just unemployed from 1933 to 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: How did you survive financially?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: He was...he was actually a veteran.</sentence><sentence id="176">But being a German national, he had actually abdicated his right for pension because "I don't go and collect from my father[land]. "</sentence><sentence id="177">That was the attitude.</sentence><sentence id="178">An idiot, of course. (</sentence><sentence id="179">Laughing) But he... finally, he was terribly sick.</sentence><sentence id="180">He had TB, open TB, and was about to die; so they admitted him to a <span class="BUILDING">veteran's hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">And his pension was restored, but on a level about 50% disability.</sentence><sentence id="182">But he was really 250% disabled, really.</sentence><sentence id="183">So he spent uh half a year in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>; was operated several times, of course, to no avail.</sentence><sentence id="184">But the acute conditions were removed.</sentence><sentence id="185">My mother and my sister and I, we lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which cost as about 80% of our income.</sentence><sentence id="186">And when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, people didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="187">They thought we were criminals.</sentence><sentence id="188">Kicked out from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for not paying taxes, or stealing something, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="189">I mean, the Germans to me were completely insensitive--even to the needs of their own people in a way, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
