<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1317">Q: Well,</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1318">Q: When you got help from these farmers who let people get across, did you have to pay them anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1320">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="1321">Nothing, they didn't accept any money.</sentence><sentence id="1322">These people did it just to be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1323">And that happened, one of the persons my sister helped, I helped her -- we were both doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1324">But we helped one person cross, and that person had forgotten in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> his tobacco card, which was valuable, very valuable for bartering.</sentence><sentence id="1325">Because if you didn't smoke, then you could barter it for other things.</sentence><sentence id="1326">Food, for other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1327">So he wrote to us and asked him to send him the card, and my sister sent him the card through the farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1328">We couldn't communicate with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> -- okay, unoccupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> directly, but we sent that to the farmer who sent it on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mailbox</span> to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And that letter was caught, and she did a terrible mistake.</sentence><sentence id="1330">We never understood, she signed her real name which we never did.</sentence><sentence id="1331">We knew as much, that you never signed a letter.</sentence><sentence id="1332">And why did she do it that day?</sentence><sentence id="1333">We don't know, but she signed the letter.</sentence><sentence id="1334">And during the day, the day she was arrested, the farmer's son, one farmer's son came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from his <span class="DLF">farm</span> which was perhaps 12 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span>, I don't know exactly, by <span

father didn't know who Stephanie Hoffnung, so we knew that, so we didn't even think that she should escape.</sentence><sentence id="1336">You know, she stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And at night at dinnertime, because every night, that was another restriction -- every night after sundown, the Germans would come and make an appeal to see if we were all present.</sentence><sentence id="1338">To make sure we are there every night, the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1339">And that night an SS we had never seen before, a , which means a noncommissioned officer, a horrible looking guy.</sentence><sentence id="1340">He was very taller than I, horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1341">He came with two other guys, two other SS and they arrested my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1342">We were eating, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1343">And Jackie was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1344">We were eating cherries, we were at the

at the most, he took out the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and threw them at</sentence><sentence id="1348">0 the Germans, and I looked at him.</sentence><sentence id="1349">And in front of the Germans, I said to him in French, I said, "Jackie, a Frenchman is always polite.</sentence><sentence id="1350">Never doubt that."</sentence><sentence id="1351">I was afraid they kill that kid.</sentence><sentence id="1352">So he didn't do it anymore, but the Germans didn't do anything against him.</sentence><sentence id="1353">But they arrested my sister, they were satisfied with that.</sentence><sentence id="1354">They took her away, and then about two hours later, they came back and arrested my father.</sentence><sentence id="1355">But they released him several hours later, and my father tried to help my sister but there was nothing he could do.</sentence><sentence id="1356">They wanted her to tell them that she had written to that farmer, because that farmer was helping people cross and she said she doesn't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1357">She cannot tell them, she maintained that.</sentence><sentence id="1358">And they told her that she's fresh, and they told my father that they keep her because he raised her bad and she's fresh.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And that's what killed her, because she would absolutely not say anything against the farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1360">She would have died before she did.</sentence><sentence id="1361">She died because of it.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And the farmer was released because they had no proof.</sentence><sentence id="1363">So she was kept in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for one month.</sentence><sentence id="1364">She became 21 in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pratique</span> on the 10th of July she became 21.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And then she was deported to -- she was moved to - -

that's why we escaped because we hoped that she could escape, too.</sentence><sentence id="1367">We had arranged help that she could escape because until then, she had several times the opportunity to

the most educated in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> as much as I can tell and she took over the whole organization.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And she told us, because we have the guard who we knew very well.</sentence><sentence id="1375">He was one of the kids who had walked with us to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1376">You know, when we helped the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1377">And we were very, very friendly, and he accepted her to make her escape, but she said she couldn't do that because of the people would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1378">The Germans always told them if they tried to escape, they would kill her.</sentence><sentence id="1379">But the guards were French, the Germans came in only every morning.</sentence><sentence id="1380">But at night there was no guard -- no German, so the</sentence><sentence id="1382">1 French guard wanted to make her escape and he would have escaped with her, not to be arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1383">But she refused them, but later she understood what mistake it was.</sentence><sentence id="1384">But then I had organized everything; she was a

there.</sentence><sentence id="1388">First, when I was accepted in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, nobody -- when I told them, you know, I'm Jewish, they said, "Who cares?</sentence><sentence id="1389">That has no meaning for us."</sentence><sentence id="1390">You know, the French administration, the directors of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the picture I showed you earlier of my classmates, the directors of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and our instructor in that picture, too.</sentence><sentence id="1391">And they said, "We couldn't care less.</sentence><sentence id="1392">You are French person.</sentence><sentence id="1393">You want to come in <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span>, you come in <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1394">And they accepted me, and I was protected there.</sentence><sentence id="1395">When Germans came to arrest patients, it was Catholic nuns who directed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1396">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross school</span>, which was separate.</sentence><sentence id="1397">But we all, you know, did all our work, practical work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was by then at that time completely run by the Catholic nuns.</sentence><sentence id="1398">And the Catholic nuns would be warned if the Germans were arriving and they hid me, so that they don't see me.</sentence><sentence id="1399">Because the director of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> said to me, "You are not going to wear the yellow star in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1400">I don't want to see it."</sentence><sentence id="1401">And I didn't wear it, but they knew that they would arrest me because I don't wear it.</sentence><sentence id="1402">That was already the best punishment, just for that.</sentence><sentence id="1403">So they hid me every time that the Germans came to arrest people, take them to the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1404">You know, old people, young people, whatever they -- whoever they wanted, not just Jews but whoever they felt they should arrest.</sentence><sentence id="1405">It was enough that somebody tell them it's a Communist, even if it was absolutely not true, then they would arrest.</sentence><sentence id="1406">But my sister then she -- we had arranged, I had seen one of the doctors at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1407">And we had arranged that she wasn't feeling well, she had a kidney problem, a serious kidney problem and he knew that.</sentence><sentence id="1408">So I had discussed that with him, and he agreed that if she is coming to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> the morning we were escaping, then he would treat -- the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then he didn't know anything else, but all my classmates, her boyfriend -- my fiance said -- as soon she arrives in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, they get her out and get her across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1409">But unfortunately,</sentence><sentence id="1411">2 the morning she was supposed to be there, she was supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the little SS came.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And when he -- you Ametz appealed to her to stand there for hours.</sentence><sentence id="1413">He -- seven people were on the side to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and he said to them, "Nobody goes to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1414">That was a combination, because after that they knew we had gone, so then she had no more chance.</sentence><sentence id="1415">So that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1416">So from the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span>, she was later sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> she was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.1669818" long="2.2483174">Pithiviers</span>, which is between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.9153658" long="1.8974863">Orleans</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.1669818" long="2.2483174">Pithiviers</span>, she was deported on the day of Yom Kippur, 8-42 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">And we know she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because I have the book saying that her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in three days.</sentence><sentence id="1419">And we got cards; after the war was finished, her boyfriend had received a card that she had smuggled out on the day of Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="1420">It was a nurse of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the card said she couldn't write to us.</sentence><sentence id="1421">But she wrote to him, and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1422">And she -- which isn't very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.1669818" long="2.2483174">Pithiviers</span>, and that card -- he gave me that card when he met me after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1423">And in that card, she told that they are leaving, the morale excellent.</sentence><sentence id="1424">They prayed and fasted all day on Yom Kippur; they didn't know how much fasting they would do afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1425">And she was deported that day.</sentence><sentence id="1426">She wrote to us that she would try by all means, we had the code to make little points on those certain letters.</sentence><sentence id="1427">The Germans, if they had found the card with that, would have absolutely known what the code means.</sentence><sentence id="1428">They would have broken the code in no time, but she wrote, "I will sabotage my work as much as I can."</sentence><sentence id="1429">She didn't realize, we didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1430">It was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1431">But anyway, she was deported, but in between we decided to leave so that she can escape.</sentence><sentence id="1432">And because that things were getting worse and worse, so we knew it was time.</sentence><sentence id="1433">It was right after I was a graduate of the first year of nursing, and all my classmates helped.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Everybody helped.</sentence><sentence id="1435">My fiance helped.</sentence><sentence id="1436">The neighbors helped, they came and took our belongings out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1437">We got everything back after the war, but one family didn't -- was not honest.</sentence><sentence id="1438">But, otherwise, they all would give us back everything we left.</sentence><sentence id="1439">You know, all that was risking their lives, and the night before we left -- oh, I have first to talk about something else.</sentence><sentence id="1440">Several weeks earlier, a man I had worked with at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>, I knew him but not very much.</sentence><sentence id="1441">His name is Albert Charpentier, C-h-a-r-p-e-n-t-i-e-r, and his wife, I have paper here telling me</sentence><sentence id="1443">3 the name of his wife who died, too, now.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And not -- his son, but I can show you the paper later.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And it said Mr. Charpentier came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and told me -- because he knew me -- and said, "I know that you need peoples without those damn Jews."</sentence><sentence id="1446">Because on top of it, all of our identity cards had the stamp Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1447">So he said, "I have to" -- "I can give you cards for everybody in your family."</sentence><sentence id="1448">And I asked him how much it would cost, and his response was to say, "How can you ask me how much it can cost?</sentence><sentence id="1449">Such a thing, you don't pay for.</sentence><sentence id="1450">I do it because that's what I believe in."</sentence><sentence id="1451">And he was a poor man, he was not a rich man at all at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And he did it, he gave us cards and that's why we could escape.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Because as long we had the Jew stamped, we could not walk anywhere, couldn't go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1454">So he saved the life of my whole family, and for -- he didn't -- but I have to say that.</sentence><sentence id="1455">I forgot.</sentence><sentence id="1456">That Mr. Charpentier since he was very young had worked for one of the three or four Jewish families who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span> for a long time and had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And he was there, and he loved them because they had always been extremely nice to him.</sentence><sentence id="1458">And he told me how I will never forget what the Forshan (ph), that's the name of the Jewish family, who survived.</sentence><sentence id="1459">They were not deported.</sentence><sentence id="1460">What's -- undoubtedly, he did cards for them, too.</sentence><sentence id="1461">Never asked, but the Forshan, I'll never forget what they did for me and my family and what I can do for Jews, you're all French and I will do that for you peoples.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I want you to be safe.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I cannot accept that that will be.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And that's what we heard.</sentence><sentence id="1465">You know, when we walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> when we start to wear the star, old men -- very proper old men, you know, because they used to love the little nobility in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1466">I told you it's a very backwoods country, very right wing.</sentence><sentence id="1467">They would cross the <span

accident; it was constant.</sentence><sentence id="1470">Not everybody did, but it happened many, many, many times.</sentence><sentence id="1471">They would come to my mother who spoke no -- very little French, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.119202" long="6.179172">Metz</span> my parents were raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1472">They were not raised -- they spoke beautiful German.</sentence><sentence id="1473">That's why we all spoke German, and with my parents we never spoke French.</sentence><sentence id="1474">We spoke German, but sisters and brothers, we all spoke French.</sentence><sentence id="1475">We never spoke German and we never do.</sentence><sentence id="1476">But at <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> we would go from one language, and my parents understood what we were saying.</sentence><sentence id="1477">For a long time we didn't know that,</sentence><sentence id="1479">4 and we thought we can say things we shouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1480">And then when they would discover what that's about, but that was when we were teenagers.</sentence><sentence id="1481">But my parents spoke French, they understood it but they spoke comically.</sentence><sentence id="1482">It was not what it should have been because they learned it when they were adults and they never went to <span

And there were quite high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vosges</span>, but it was a plain winter and it was snow.</sentence><sentence id="4255">I had snow to almost to my waist.</sentence><sentence id="4256">And they had organized -- I had joined the Commanders of Africa, which is a unit.</sentence><sentence id="4257">And the Colonel of that unit was Bouvet, B-o-u-v-e-t.And I was sent -- I was brought by my intelligence unit to that commando so that they helped cross.</sentence><sentence id="4258">And the Colonel Bouvet had a daughter my age, and he took a terrific liking to me.</sentence><sentence id="4259">And he helped me -- do you know, he was so worried that something happens to me, so a whole group of people came with me of the Army.</sentence><sentence id="4260">A Captain was chief of the group, and then there was at least 10 more people.</sentence><sentence id="4261">And some soldiers, three or four more officers and some soldiers,</sentence><sentence id="4263">2 to accompany me to a certain little way in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, I don't remember how you call that.</sentence><sentence id="4264">This sentier in French, which is a small <span class="DLF">passageway</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4265">And I had been explained what to do, that I come to that -- they will accompany me to that point, then they would leave me.</sentence><sentence id="4266">And I would walk along that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sentier</span>, that little <span class="DLF">passageway</span>, until I reached the Germans, who would be -- and I knew where I could find them.</sentence><sentence id="4267">And the Colonel said, "Just below where you reach the Germans, I am going to have a group of my people watch for you, and if you feel that the Germans have understood what's going on, that they are going to harm you, you scream and they come and get you."</sentence><sentence id="4268">You know, they were commanders. "</sentence><sentence id="4269">They come to get you.</sentence><sentence id="4270">You don't need -- I absolutely want you to be safe."</sentence><sentence id="4271">And I went, and that was in the middle of the night and we arrived to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they left me.</sentence><sentence id="4272">And I started walking, and it was before sundown -- sunup, much before.</sentence><sentence id="4273">And it was very gray, it was a lot of snow, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="4274">But when I walked, I saw a group of two soldiers, German soldiers, in a post hidden below me.</sentence><sentence id="4275">But I continued, I had no intention -- they were looking, they saw.</sentence><sentence id="4276">But I had no intention of talking to them because I want to go to the post; I didn't want to talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="4277">I wasn't told to do that, you know, I was told to go there.</sentence><sentence id="4278">But I knew where they posts, I noticed.</sentence><sentence id="4279">But I continued walking, and just when it became a little less gray, I arrived at a little in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4280">And there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, and I came in an intersection of the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, of the little <span class="DLF">mountain roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4281">And suddenly a soldier arrested me, and I thought he was a German, but he was a French soldier.</sentence><sentence id="4282">And he was a Moroccan and then there were several Moroccan around him who came towards me, and they want to shoot me because they thought that was a German spy.</sentence><sentence id="4283">And I said, "No shooting, no shooting."</sentence><sentence id="4284">Because they were telling me, "We are going to shoot you, you dirty German spy."</sentence><sentence id="4285">They were insulting me, do you know, in French because they spoke French.</sentence><sentence id="4286">They were French soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="4287">And I said, "Oh, no"...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4327">Q: Could I ask you to stop for a moment?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4329">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4331">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="4332">So the Moroccans were ready to shoot you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4339">A: Yes, and I told them, "Don't shoot.</sentence><sentence id="4340">Call your officer," because I knew that they always had an officer.</sentence><sentence id="4341">But I didn't know who they were.</sentence><sentence id="4342">And then they called their <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I said to him, "Why was I arrested?"</sentence><sentence id="4343">And he said, "Because you walked into here.</sentence><sentence id="4344">What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="4345">And I said, "Okay, I don't what you are, but call Colonel Bouvet immediately in such-and-such unit," and I gave him the phone number," and tell that I'm with you."</sentence><sentence id="4346">And he said, "Colonel Bouvet, how do know him?"</sentence><sentence id="4347">And I said, "But I know him."</sentence><sentence id="4348">And then I looked at him and I said, "Are you from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="4349">And he said, "Sure."</sentence><sentence id="4350">And I said, "You were the people who were supposed to protect me and you arrest me?"</sentence><sentence id="4351">And he said, "But you were not walking on the right little <span class="DLF">passageway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4352">You were walking one <span class="NPIP">below</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4353">You know, they are on the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, there are several.</sentence><sentence id="4354">And in the night, the guide took me there.</sentence><sentence id="4355">He was an Alsatian from the <span class="DLF">Barrier</span>, but in the night he made a mistake and put me on the wrong <span class="DLF">passageway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4356">So I was arrested and then the Germans saw it because they were just a few paces away, but they didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="4357">They want to see what was going on, and they took me back to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> where I was debriefed and I told them what everything I saw which was very important things I saw.</sentence><sentence id="4358">Where resistance was -- do you know, where the Germans had posts in our <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were watching us and reporting.</sentence><sentence id="4359">But it was such a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, you can have a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="4360">So I gave all the information, but I was terribly upset that I had been arrested by the French.</sentence><sentence id="4361">And top of it, I could have been shot.</sentence><sentence id="4362">They were absolutely ready to do it if I hadn't defended myself.</sentence><sentence id="4363">But I had been told how to react to people, you know, what to do in case I was in danger.</sentence><sentence id="4364">That was one the premiums you get, how you survive in such cases.</sentence><sentence id="4365">So I came back -- first, I was debriefed by another unit and by intelligence, and then I went back to Colonel Bouvet.</sentence><sentence id="4366">After that they tried 13 times to make me cross, 13 other times.</sentence><sentence id="4367">That was bungled purposely, but the Captain who was the chief of the unit who took me there, he could not accept that his mission was not done right.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4368">So he said that I got confused and went on the wrong <span class="DLF">passageway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4369">And I had a terrible fight with him, and I said absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="4370">And the guide said, "Look, that's enough.</sentence><sentence id="4371">No, I made the mistake."</sentence><sentence id="4372">So that was okay, but the Captain and I, we were not on the best terms after that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4373">Okay.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4378">Q: Did you and this officer havea...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4379">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4380">Right.</sentence><sentence id="4381">But after that I tried 13 times to cross, and the second time they let me go ina big <span class="DLF">field</span> and they were shooting, you know, tracers all over.</sentence><sentence id="4382">And it was night, it was always at night, and that was perhaps a week later or 10 days later.</sentence><sentence id="4383">And then they let me go and they go this way, but they didn't give me any indication, do you know, a real indication what I should do, and then you will find the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4384">And I walked around at night, I walked in circles.</sentence><sentence id="4385">And I heard dogs barking everywhere, but I didn't know where the dogs were, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4386">And I walked in circles, and they didn't tell me there was a <span class="DLF">canal</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="4387">And I fell in the <span class="DLF">canal</span>, never even caught a cold, nothing, I walked all the rest of the night in my wet clothes and I never caught a cold.</sentence><sentence id="4388">There was -- you know, you live under such hype that nothing happens to you.</sentence><sentence id="4389">But anyway, I walked all morning -- all night, and couldn't find my way because there was snow, there was a <span class="DLF">canal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4390">There was dog barkings and I didn't know where to go.</sentence><sentence id="4391">They had not given me good indications what <span class="DLF">road</span> to go, how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4392">And toward the morning when it started to be light, I saw a whole unit of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> with soldiers coming on the <span class="DLF">road</span> a little far away.</sentence><sentence id="4393">Quite far away.</sentence><sentence id="4394">And I thought it was the Germans, so I walked toward them.</sentence><sentence id="4395">And when I approached, they were speaking French.</sentence><sentence id="4396">So they were -- so I was -- but these ones did not try to harm me.</sentence><sentence id="4397">Because immediately the officer took me aside and said, "What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="4398">And I explained to him, and he got in touch with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> and they came and got me.</sentence><sentence id="4399">But 12 more times -- but most of the time it was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="4400">One night they wanted me to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Rhine</span>, swimming in wintertime.</sentence><sentence id="4401">I would have died of hyperthermia before I crossed even half of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4402">It was so stupid, I said, "That is impossible."</sentence><sentence id="4403">Any girl would not survive such a swimming.</sentence><sentence id="4404">That is impossible, I couldn't explain that I'd do that.</sentence><sentence id="4405">No German could believe so much, you know, that the girls would swim in plain winter through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4406">So I said that I didn't accept.</sentence><sentence id="4407">And then the 15th time or the 13th time -- I think it's the 15th time, I finally made it.</sentence><sentence id="4408">But that was well organized -- well, I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4409">And it's a Swiss agent who picked me up.</sentence><sentence id="4410">I was taken by my <span class="BUILDING">unit</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span>, you know, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4411">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span>, I was met by a Swiss agent who took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> which is not very far.</sentence><sentence id="4412">And in</sentence><sentence id="4414">5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> there is a little enclave, the <span class="DLF">German road</span> passes near a <span class="DLF">field</span> which is Swiss, and there is a little -- I remember how it looked and there was a forrest to the left.</sentence><sentence id="4415">The <span class="DLF">road</span> in front of us and to the right was a little enclave -- is a <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4416">And the Swiss spent all day with me there, and he was -- for me, was an old man.</sentence><sentence id="4417">He was God know, he was near his 50s, perhaps late 40s.</sentence><sentence id="4418">For me, he looked very old.</sentence><sentence id="4419">And he said to me, "Listen, you are surely going to die.</sentence><sentence id="4420">Why don't we sleep together?</sentence><sentence id="4421">Why don't we have a good time?"</sentence><sentence id="4422">And I told him, "Why don't you go and jump in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4423">But I'm not going to do such a thing."</sentence><sentence id="4424">I had no intention of dying and no intention of sleeping with him.</sentence><sentence id="4425">And he cried, but -- and then he told me -- but he was very decent in that way.</sentence><sentence id="4426">He did not assault me or anything.</sentence><sentence id="4427">He tried verbally to entice me, and his way of enticing me was not very enticing anyway.</sentence><sentence id="4428">But anyway, towards the evening, towards dusk, I lie down in the <span class="DLF">field</span> very close to the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4429">And I had white knee socks on, and I had the impression that the whole German Army could see my white socks, do you know?</sentence><sentence id="4430">You wouldn't believe in what terror I was.</sentence><sentence id="4431">It was absolute terror, I could not move.</sentence><sentence id="4432">And I think how did I -- what did I get into such a predicament?</sentence><sentence id="4433">How can | do it?</sentence><sentence id="4434">I cannot do it.</sentence><sentence id="4435">And I stayed there quietly, I couldn't bring myself to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4436">And at one point, I said I have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4437">No way.</sentence><sentence id="4438">And I remembered that that Captain who was Captain Mollet, M-o-1-l-e-t, had said that I had bungled because I had got confused.</sentence><sentence id="4439">And that made me do it, and when I came back, I told him that.</sentence><sentence id="4440">Boy, was he feeling -- was he embarrassed.</sentence><sentence id="4441">In front of everybody I told him of the whole, you know, all the officers of the unit.</sentence><sentence id="4442">But anyway, I finally stood up, walked to the <span class="DLF">road</span> and there were two Germans, sentinels, who were crossing each other.</sentence><sentence id="4443">So I walked to -- but were never -- you know, I waited until I see that, and I walked there and I met him.</sentence><sentence id="4444">I said, "Heil, Hitler."</sentence><sentence id="4445">And he said, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="4446">I said, "To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helsinger</span>," which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there, or a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> very close.</sentence><sentence id="4447">I don't remember how big that was, very close to that, walking distance, but at night and I walked there and he didn't bother me.</sentence><sentence id="4448">He didn't ask for papers, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="4449">But I had identify papers of the German , and my name was Marthe Ulrich, U-I-r-i-c-h. Unfortunately, 1 lost all these papers, I don't know where they are.</sentence><sentence id="4450">They must be somewhere, but I don't know where.</sentence><sentence id="4451">I looked for them, and I didn't find them.</sentence><sentence id="4452">And I had these papers, and I had coupons for</sentence><sentence id="4454">6 food and all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="4455">And I had all <span class="NPIP">places</span> where to go.</sentence><sentence id="4456">The first one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sink</span>, that's why I walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sink</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4457">And it was a young -- somebody gave me a recommendation for that family, but they never knew who I was and what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="4458">But I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, it was quiet, it was 10 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="4459">Knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and they opened -- the woman opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4460">Her husband was in the Army...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4553">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4554">I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and she said, "Who are you?"</sentence><sentence id="4555">And I told her that such-as-such person -- I don't remember who it was -- recommended me, who was a good friend of hers.</sentence><sentence id="4556">That he had told me that I could come to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="4557">That she would, you know, take me in.</sentence><sentence id="4558">And she did and she was very nice about it.</sentence><sentence id="4559">And the next day, she said to me, "I notice" -- because underneath my socks, my white socks, I had silk socks, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4560">She noticed they were all torn.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4573">Q: We need to stop the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4575">A: She had noticed that my silk -- at that time, we had no pantyhose, but silk stockings were completely torn.</sentence><sentence id="4576">So she said to me, "What happened?"</sentence><sentence id="4577">I said, "I fell," because Helsinger was -- and she told me, you know, "We have so many worries about spies coming over from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, when I saw your torn socks, stockings, I was afraid of something like that."</sentence><sentence id="4578">And I start laughing and said, "Do I look like a spy?"</sentence><sentence id="4579">No, I had to absolutely get out of that.</sentence><sentence id="4580">And she said, "No, really you don't."</sentence><sentence id="4581">And I said, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="4582">I'm not one.</sentence><sentence id="4583">I'ma good German."</sentence><sentence id="4584">So that's how I got out of that.</sentence><sentence id="4585">So I stayed with them about two or three days, and then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> which is northwest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helsinger</span>, and that's not too far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4586">And that's in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, but there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fribourg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4587">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, and there I had an address, too, to go where a young Alsatian doctor who had been</sentence><sentence id="4589">7 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had lived with that family, with a man and woman.</sentence><sentence id="4590">And he -- they were very good friends, and he told me to -- oh, I never met him.</sentence><sentence id="4591">But soon my unit, I knew that he accepted to send me there.</sentence><sentence id="4592">So I said I came from him, and I had papers from him.</sentence><sentence id="4593">I had some proof that he had, you know, that I had a husband.</sentence><sentence id="4594">That he had written me a letter or something.</sentence><sentence id="4595">So they accepted me very well, and they never questioned me.</sentence><sentence id="4596">And -- but I had another address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> of the doctor who was Alsatian, and his father wasin___and he asked -- he knew that somebody was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on a mission.</sentence><sentence id="4597">And he asked if they would go and see him so that he can help me so he can possibly return to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4598">Because he had married a German woman and stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4599">He was Alsatian.</sentence><sentence id="4600">And I went to see him, and that was terrible fiasco.</sentence><sentence id="4601">Because the guy absolutely -- he said, "I am married to German."</sentence><sentence id="4602">I told him, I was told to tell him what I was doing there.</sentence><sentence id="4603">But his father -- I didn't meet his father again, the father gave the instructions that what I should tell him.</sentence><sentence id="4604">And I told him, "I will help you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4605">You know, the war will be soon over.</sentence><sentence id="4606">It's just a question of days now, and I can help you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> if you help me.</sentence><sentence id="4607">Give me information about what's going on here.</sentence><sentence id="4608">Military information."</sentence><sentence id="4609">And he said to me, "Oh, how can I do that?</sentence><sentence id="4610">I'm married to a German citizen.</sentence><sentence id="4611">I cannot do that, absolutely."</sentence><sentence id="4612">And then he said, "Where are you staying?"</sentence><sentence id="4613">And I said, "I have no address yet.</sentence><sentence id="4614">I have not found yet <span class="NPIP">anywhere</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="4615">I am going to probably travel right away."</sentence><sentence id="4616">I was afraid of him, I was terrified.</sentence><sentence id="4617">I wanted to get out of there, so I got out as soon as possible and took all kinds of tours to make sure that I'm not followed.</sentence><sentence id="4618">But I was never followed.</sentence><sentence id="4619">And when the French Army came in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> later, quite later, he looked for me and wanted me to help him go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4620">But I did not accept to meet him, I refused because he had not helped me.</sentence><sentence id="4621">He was very atrocious, he would have had arrested me, had he known where to find me.</sentence><sentence id="4622">I understood that, and I stayed away from him.</sentence><sentence id="4623">But I found other people who helped and they would give me information.</sentence><sentence id="4624">The girls, Alsatian girls were in the German Army and were dying to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4625">And, you know, I could tell them that I can help them go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, if they help me.</sentence><sentence id="4626">And that was a great help.</sentence><sentence id="4627">It was the last few weeks of the war.</sentence><sentence id="4628">Three weeks, two weeks, I don't remember exactly.</sentence><sentence id="4629">Three weeks about.</sentence><sentence id="4630">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, | think I was</sentence><sentence id="4632">8 there about three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="4633">But -- and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, I had another address to go outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> I cannot remember, which extremely close to the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4634">And the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4635">You could just walk there, 300 yards and you were in the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4636">And I went to that doctor, there was another doctor who I was told to go to.</sentence><sentence id="4637">But he wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and his wife, which was probably very good, but the maid, they fed me because I was hungry.</sentence><sentence id="4638">I was walking all the time, and I didn't know where to stop, so I was afraid.</sentence><sentence id="4639">But when she asked me, "Would you like something to eat?"</sentence><sentence id="4640">I said, "Yes," when I told her I want to see her employer.</sentence><sentence id="4641">But walking towards that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, I was with a group of people.</sentence><sentence id="4642">Women and there was one non-commissioned officer, an SS, little guy, too.</sentence><sentence id="4643">Very little guy.</sentence><sentence id="4644">And he was talking about, you know, all the things the SS do.</sentence><sentence id="4645">How much they do and how they hate the Jews and how they hate the Poles and how they hate the Russians and what they do to these people.</sentence><sentence id="4646">He was talking openly about it, and then suddenly he fainted.</sentence><sentence id="4647">He was coming back, he told us that he had been wounded and just came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span>, and he fainted.</sentence><sentence id="4648">And I was a German nurse, so I took care of him.</sentence><sentence id="4649">So when he came back to it, he was very grateful, you know, that I had been so nice to him.</sentence><sentence id="4650">And we became best friends, even if he told me that he could smell a Jew at miles; he had told me.</sentence><sentence id="4651">And he told me any time I want to come to the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> to visit him, he would be delighted and he would introduce me to all his friends.</sentence><sentence id="4652">And he gave me his address and told me how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="4653">So the day -- I was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> a few days, but then I went back somewhere else, but I cannot remember.</sentence><sentence id="4654">I traveled and I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> one day.</sentence><sentence id="4655">And in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- but that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.471" long="7.941">Offenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4656">I think that was near, not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, but just a distance.</sentence><sentence id="4657">Because I was afraid to take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and I went, you know, I went with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4658">But they took you, as they took the civilians because they knew that it was very little -- there was very little communication.</sentence><sentence id="4659">You couldn't travel very easily.</sentence><sentence id="4660">And the Americans were always bombarding, but I was so lucky before I entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they bombarded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4661">When I left, they started bombarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4662">But I was there, I was never under bombardment of the Americans, which was good because boy, did they destroy things.</sentence><sentence id="4663">And then I went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.471" long="7.941">Offenburg</span>, and I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> going somewhere and -- because the</sentence><sentence id="4665">9 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> had told me to say goodbye to the south, to go up the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> where I wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="4666">But they took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.471" long="7.941">Offenburg</span> to a complete different section.</sentence><sentence id="4667">And we were in the -- I remember now.</sentence><sentence id="4668">We were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> all night, and it was freezing.</sentence><sentence id="4669">You know, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in the back, it was freezing.</sentence><sentence id="4670">We were absolutely frozen.</sentence><sentence id="4671">It was in winter in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the forrest, and we arrived early morning in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> stopped.</sentence><sentence id="4672">So we went out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4673">There were seven civilians, and we were lying in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4674">And then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> came over, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span>, but they didn't bombard.</sentence><sentence id="4675">I was there, so they didn't bombard.</sentence><sentence id="4676">And I fell asleep there, I was so tired that I fell asleep.</sentence><sentence id="4677">And suddenly more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> came by, so they shook me up.</sentence><sentence id="4678">You know, the people around me shook me to awake me.</sentence><sentence id="4679">And I was so surprised and I didn't know where I was, and I started to answer in French.</sentence><sentence id="4680">That was quite a thing.</sentence><sentence id="4681">When I realized they were looking at me very strangely, and | said in five minutes I'm arrested.</sentence><sentence id="4682">So I got up and said I needed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and I run.</sentence><sentence id="4683">And I run to a <span class="DLF">hole</span>, and I find the milkman who came by with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4684">And I stopped him and he took me to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4685">And that's how I escaped, but I would have been arrested because they looked at me very strangely.</sentence><sentence id="4686">They had to think what they were going to do next.</sentence><sentence id="4687">But that was the only time where I awoke and spoke French, but it's very difficult not to.</sentence><sentence id="4688">And then I took another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, I don't remember exactly, do you know, the sequence.</sentence><sentence id="4689">But I know I was in another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and there was only one non-commissioned officer in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4690">And all the rest were women, and that commissioned officer started to tell how they treated Russians and Poles in the East.</sentence><sentence id="4691">They were not talking about Jews, that how they treated the Russians and the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="4692">How they assembled the whole people, all the people from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4693">Put them in a square, and start shooting them with machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="4694">It's the ach mein, you know, the Germans speak like that.</sentence><sentence id="4695">Ach mein, and slap the side many times and say,"You should have seen running like little mice."</sentence><sentence id="4696">It was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="4697">And I thought that, and everybody -- all the women laughed.</sentence><sentence id="4698">They felt that was very funny.</sentence><sentence id="4699">And I had to laugh with them, I had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="4700">So I didn't laugh too much, but I had to laugh some.</sentence><sentence id="4704">0 Tape 5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4841">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4843">A: One point I wanted to make is that always the German afterwards, after we won the war, always pretended that they did not know, and that's absolutely not true.</sentence><sentence id="4844">They knew it because the soldiers came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they told the story.</sentence><sentence id="4845">They told about all these barbaric things.</sentence><sentence id="4846">I head it, | was there only three weeks and I heard it.</sentence><sentence id="4847">And how could the people who lived there all the time not hear it?</sentence><sentence id="4848">And I didn't know the people who told me then.</sentence><sentence id="4849">So they boasted about it openly, so that's a big myth that's the Germans did not know.</sentence><sentence id="4850">And I have friends who were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, a young Alsatian, who was later in our unit.</sentence><sentence id="4851">And he said -- he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="4852">And he said that when they were taken out on walks to go to the <span class="BUILDING">work site</span> every day, there were skeletons, all these people.</sentence><sentence id="4853">And there were barely walking, and people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> would throw stones at them and beat them.</sentence><sentence id="4854">On top of -- do you know, all the other brutalities?</sentence><sentence id="4855">So these were town people, and they all said, "Oh, we did not know."</sentence><sentence id="4856">You know, one German one day recognized what the Germans did to me, and I shook his hand.</sentence><sentence id="4857">I said, "You are the only honest German I ever met."</sentence><sentence id="4858">It was unbelievable that they absolutely denied the horrible things they all knew they had done.</sentence><sentence id="4859">It was no secret.</sentence><sentence id="4860">It was impossible to have a secret.</sentence><sentence id="4861">So I think that point is very important.</sentence><sentence id="4862">Okay, now I go back to my story.</sentence><sentence id="4863">I don't know where I am.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4885">Q: Well, you had been to the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4886">You had traveled ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4889">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4890">Then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, and I hope that the French were coming that day.</sentence><sentence id="4891">I knew they were getting close because -- and there Germans with bazooka in corners, you know at every <span class="NPIP">place where</span> they could hide a little bit and waiting for the French.</sentence><sentence id="4892">And I went around, and I was such a good German, and I said, "Oh, my God.</sentence><sentence id="4893">I hope nothing will happen to you because you don't know, do you realize I saw them coming from up there?</sentence><sentence id="4894">They have enormous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming."</sentence><sentence id="4895">They have no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, they have nothing, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4896">So most of them got down from their post, they got frightened because I told them that.</sentence><sentence id="4897">And then I was in the main <span class="DLF">street</span> when the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> came.</sentence><sentence id="4898"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French tank</span> -- no, yeah, French.</sentence><sentence id="4899">They were the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4903">1 French.</sentence><sentence id="4904">And I made the V sign like that and stopped it, and I asked that the officer come down.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4905">They had quite a few Germans, prisoners, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> all over.</sentence><sentence id="4906">And I told him, "Please come down, I need to talk to you."</sentence><sentence id="4907">And I took him aside and I told him, "I am here.</sentence><sentence id="4908">I am part of the Army.</sentence><sentence id="4909">I'm in the intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="4910">I need to see -- to be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> right now.</sentence><sentence id="4911">I need to go there because I have very important information to give them.</sentence><sentence id="4912">And he took me and I met Commander Petit, Petit, who was the chief -- he was commander or colonel, I don't remember, of the second Division Zaire, that was the regiment.</sentence><sentence id="4913">And that was, too, a regiment from <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4914">And Colonel Petit first was a little leery about me, you know, when he start to question me.</sentence><sentence id="4915">And he was -- he didn't believe me.</sentence><sentence id="4916">He thought I was making up stories and then he start questioning me.</sentence><sentence id="4917">He had been in intelligence, and I told him what information I had, who to contact, how to contact and then ended story and I was okay.</sentence><sentence id="4918">So I told him the important information I had.</sentence><sentence id="4919">That day, I had gone back to <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> to see my good friend, the little SS, who had invited me to come because I want to see what's going at that <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4920">And when | arrived at the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> and I inquired about him, they were all leaving.</sentence><sentence id="4921">The <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> was emptying, the French came down, not south but west -- no, east of the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4922">They did not want to deal with the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span>, but my information was the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> was empty, not to worry about it.</sentence><sentence id="4923">So that was extremely important military information right then and there.</sentence><sentence id="4924">So Colonel Petit believed me and he sent out, you know, patrols and they found out that the <span class="DLF">Siegfried line</span> was empty.</sentence><sentence id="4925">So after that, he really believed me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4926">And I was very well treated, and he said to me, "Do you want me to send you back to your <span class="BUILDING">unit</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4927">I know where they are located."</sentence><sentence id="4928">He had gotten in touch with them to tell them I was safe, because they didn't know, didn't have any news from me.</sentence><sentence id="4929">And I told him, "No, my mission isn't finished.</sentence><sentence id="4930">I have to go back south."</sentence><sentence id="4931">Because they were coming not south.</sentence><sentence id="4932">The south, nobody was there yet.</sentence><sentence id="4933">So I said, "I go back south tomorrow morning, but I will ask you a favor.</sentence><sentence id="4934">Find me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> because I'm tired of walking."</sentence><sentence id="4935">So he found me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and the next morning I left.</sentence><sentence id="4936">And I have papers where he said that for that night, to protect me if somebody attacks me and to go through the <span class="DLF">French line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4937">And he said, "Destroy these papers you arrive."</sentence><sentence id="4938">After the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4942">2 French went, I never destroyed it.</sentence><sentence id="4943">I still have them.</sentence><sentence id="4944">You know, saying that I should be protected.</sentence><sentence id="4945">But under the name of Lelotra.</sentence><sentence id="4946">He, too, didn't know my real name, nobody did.</sentence><sentence id="4947">So I left the next morning and went south towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4948">And when I climbed up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span>, it was quite high.</sentence><sentence id="4949">And at one point, I was just pushing my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, I couldn't ride it.</sentence><sentence id="4950">It was much too incline, steep.</sentence><sentence id="4951">So a German soldier was walking there.</sentence><sentence id="4952">There were always soldiers all over walking, they didn't know where to go because they didn't know where their units were.</sentence><sentence id="4953">They were completely disorganized by then.</sentence><sentence id="4954">So he said to me, "I push your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4955">So I let him, he pushed my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4956">What do I care?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4957">Well, I don't need to do that, so I let him.</sentence><sentence id="4958">And we talked and I always talked to them that I was looking for that fiance who was lost, do you know that?</sentence><sentence id="4959">I didn't know where he was.</sentence><sentence id="4960">I always used that, and I told him that I had run away.</sentence><sentence id="4961">And I told that everybody when I got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, when I went south, everybody I met from the Army, I told them what horrible experience that was to see the French Army with black people.</sentence><sentence id="4962">Would you believe that they have black soldiers and a lot of them and they look terrible?</sentence><sentence id="4963">And they're barbaric, I made a big story.</sentence><sentence id="4964">They were all terrified, you know, because they had not more organization.</sentence><sentence id="4965">They were not structured anymore, they had no real defense.</sentence><sentence id="4966">And they were not going to get killed for nothing, so the best thing was to do that and I did a good job at that.</sentence><sentence id="4967">And I told them -- and then I went south toward the <span class="DLF">border</span> because there I had a family I wanted go to see just near the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4968">But that was the brother-in-law of the daughter, of one of the daughters of that family was in our unit.</sentence><sentence id="4969">And he told me that I can absolutely trust them, not to worry.</sentence><sentence id="4970">They wouldn't even know, they knew already that I was going to come.</sentence><sentence id="4971">So they knew all about me, and they knew that I was from the French Army.</sentence><sentence id="4972">They were very Catholic, <span class="REGION">Bavaria</span> -- no, Bedouins, you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> from the territory of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> and they were very anti-Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="4973">So I went to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but before I arrived there, I met a whole group of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> who were coming from the north going south, too, and east.</sentence><sentence id="4974">Because once you arrived to south, you have to go east.</sentence><sentence id="4975">You go into [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span>] along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4976">And I asked them what they were doing there, and I told them how terribly unhappy I was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> was taken by these horrible French and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4980">3 all these blacks and all that I repeated.</sentence><sentence id="4981">They told me, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="4982">It's here, not far."</sentence><sentence id="4983">They told me exactly where, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> there is a whole division hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they are going to beat them.</sentence><sentence id="4984">And they told me the names and they told me who they were.</sentence><sentence id="4985">You know, they were so convinced I was such a good German.</sentence><sentence id="4986">And then, I knew that it was imperative to go to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Swiss and to get that information to my partner as fast as possible.</sentence><sentence id="4987">That was vital, and I had no radio.</sentence><sentence id="4988">I had nothing, the only way I was told that I can give important and, you know, rapidly information was to go to the Swiss and tell them that I'm a Swiss agent.</sentence><sentence id="4989">And that's what I intended to do, so I arrived -- I traveled and it was quite a distance.</sentence><sentence id="4990">So at night, very late at night, I arrived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, in a square of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4991">And for some reason I never understood, I sat on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and I didn't feel like going anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4992">And in a few minutes a man came by and asked me where I was -- what I was doing there.</sentence><sentence id="4993">And I told him that I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, that I escaped the French Army and told him about all that.</sentence><sentence id="4994">And then he said to me, "Don't go this way because you are going to be bothered.</sentence><sentence id="4995">There is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> there, and they bother everybody.</sentence><sentence id="4996">They are really a hard group."</sentence><sentence id="4997">Boy, I was very happy to have stopped there.</sentence><sentence id="4998">Do you know, I had always an instinct I cannot go.</sentence><sentence id="4999">And then he told me, "Go to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near the square.</sentence><sentence id="5000">They are very nice people, and they will give you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5001">So I went and they really did, they give me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5002">And I slept there, but very early in the morning I told them I had to be getting up.</sentence><sentence id="5003">And I told them the same story, I always told everybody the same story.</sentence><sentence id="5004">Their husbands were prisoners of war, and they no news.</sentence><sentence id="5005">Or they were killed, they had no news.</sentence><sentence id="5006">But anyway, I left the next morning very early and rode to that <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span>, to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was going.</sentence><sentence id="5007">And | arrived late in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="5008">It took quite a -- it's quite a distance.</sentence><sentence id="5009">And I had to write that letter for keeping all that information, and I had no time to do it in code.</sentence><sentence id="5010">So I just wrote and the next morning at dawn, the two girls took me to the <span class="DLF">border</span> which was just a few hundred yards away.</sentence><sentence id="5011">And they were -- you know, between the German and Swiss, and they told me, "Go through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5012">And they helped me go through.
