<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Tell me what happened when the Nazis came in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: When they came in we tried to escape.</sentence><sentence id="56">We thought perhaps we would go to <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> which supposedly, you could be safe there, but it was too late.</sentence><sentence id="57">After two days of traveling, we had to turn back and we came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">At that time the Nazis had already fencing in about 20 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> or so -- and all the Jewish people had to move out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and go to live in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And had some distant cousins living there, so we moved in with them and we lived with them.</sentence><sentence id="60">My father since he spoke many languages, he was taken by the Nazis as an interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="61">And so he would work during the day and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">The rest of us -- I would --I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">My mother and my sister were taken to work to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> every day and brought back in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="64">While living there, of course, life was very harsh, very hard.</sentence><sentence id="65">We could not go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">You were supposed to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">The minute we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we had -- they put up the yellow stars on each one of us.</sentence><sentence id="68">We always had to walk around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with a yellow star, one in the back and one up front.</sentence><sentence id="69">Frightening it was, but that was part of our lives and we existed like this for a few months until one morning very early we heard knocking on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and yelling, you know, "Get out!</sentence><sentence id="70">Get out!</sentence><sentence id="71">Get out!"</sentence><sentence id="72">So quickly we got dressed and we walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we were staying in.</sentence><sentence id="73">The Gestapo was there and they told us all to go in a certain direction.</sentence><sentence id="74">My mother put on me my beautiful rabbit coat that I had, a rabbit coat and a hat.</sentence><sentence id="75">And we started following the other people, and they took us to a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">It must have been a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they told us to get undressed.</sentence><sentence id="77">And they would make you take off the jewelry and everything, any valuables that you had on you.</sentence><sentence id="78">They undressed -- they told us to get undressed.</sentence><sentence id="79">We all did.</sentence><sentence id="80">The women remained with the underwear only, and the men in their shorts.</sentence><sentence id="81">And my mother wasn't fast enough to take off her gold earrings, so she was hit by a Gestapo with the handle of a rifle and she fell down.</sentence><sentence id="82">We picked her up.</sentence><sentence id="83">And all of us -- there were a few hundred of us -- we were all already undressed, and we had to form <span class="DLF">lines</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">It was a cloudy day, very cloudy, and a very fine drizzle was going down.</sentence><sentence id="85">And all the women were so embarrassed that they were without anything on top that they all covered their breasts with their hands.</sentence><sentence id="86">And they made groups and we started walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> following the other people.</sentence><sentence id="87">As we were passing some of those <span class="DLF">streets</span> and there were some Ukrainians who were cheering as we were walking by.</sentence><sentence id="88">They were applauding and cheering.</sentence><sentence id="89">But this, this what was done to us.</sentence><sentence id="90">We kept on walking silently without saying anything until we were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">And on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> going towards where they were taking us, there were rows on both sides of Gestapo and German Shepherds.</sentence><sentence id="92">And we kept walking and the drizzle was coming down and I was so scared.</sentence><sentence id="93">I was so afraid that I developed diarrhea.</sentence><sentence id="94">But you are not allowed to talk so I didn't tell my mother anything.</sentence><sentence id="95">We just kept on walking and walking.</sentence><sentence id="96">And then my mother said, "Children, you have to pray to God."</sentence><sentence id="97">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="98">And as we were walking a black cat crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> and somehow somebody said, "Okay, now you know where we are going.</sentence><sentence id="99">We are going to be killed."</sentence><sentence id="100">But my mother said to us, "Don't think that way.</sentence><sentence id="101">Don't think that way."</sentence><sentence id="102">And we kept on walking.</sentence><sentence id="103">When we got to the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that was an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span>, there were mountains of clothing from the people before that were killed and their clothing was taken off there.</sentence><sentence id="104">They told us to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> to wait to be killed and at that time the sun came out and the day was beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="105">The sun was shining.</sentence><sentence id="106">The <span class="DLF">skies</span> were blue.</sentence><sentence id="107">And so many people standing naked in that <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="108">And my mother was looking around and she saw this tall Gestapo man.</sentence><sentence id="109">Very, very tall.</sentence><sentence id="110">And she took a chance by walking out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and walking towards him and asked him, "Do they kill non-Jews here."</sentence><sentence id="111">And he looks at her and he says, "You're not Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="112">And she says, "No, I'm not."</sentence><sentence id="113">And he said, "Well, what are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="114">She said, "Well, my husband was taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">He is someplace in one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>," she said, "and I decided with my children to come and find him to visit him."</sentence><sentence id="116">So we were walking on this <span class="DLF">road</span> and as they were bringing down the Jews, they took us along and nobody would listen to us."</sentence><sentence id="117">With that, with one of his hands, he took my mother's hand, my hand, and my sister's hand and he took us out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> and he said, "Come with me."</sentence><sentence id="118">He took us into that abandoned little <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> and he told us to sit and wait.</sentence><sentence id="119">In the meantime he told my sister that she should bring some clothing.</sentence><sentence id="120">So he took her to one of those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and she just picked up whatever clothing she was able to get for my mother, for myself and herself.</sentence><sentence id="121">And she brought it in and we started putting on the clothing.</sentence><sentence id="122">There was some other people in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and one of them was a lady with a baby in her arms, and she recognized us.</sentence><sentence id="123">And when the Gestapo came in with a Ukrainian, because the Ukrainians were collaborators, and they spoke Ukrainian and Russian and Polish.</sentence><sentence id="124">They spoke -- and they spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="125">So in order for the Gestapo to understand, you know, what we were saying because we're talking to him in Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="126">My mother was talking Ukrainian to him.</sentence><sentence id="127">So this lady turns around and says to him, "They are Jews.</sentence><sentence id="128">Why aren't they killed."</sentence><sentence id="129">And so he hit her, and we just sat there frightened.</sentence><sentence id="130">We didn't know what to say.</sentence><sentence id="131">We couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="132">And he took us out.</sentence><sentence id="133">We were already dressed.</sentence><sentence id="134">And he said to us -- he said to the Ukrainian, "You take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">You will escort them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="136">Because you could not possibly walk on the <span class="DLF">road</span> back when this was -- when they were walking all the Jews to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="137">So the Ukrainian told us to follow him and we did.</sentence><sentence id="138">As we were walking back, on the side of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, of the <span class="DLF">road</span> my mother saw many of our neighbors who were walking towards the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="139">And all she did was sigh because it was very painful to see them go.</sentence><sentence id="140">So the Ukrainian didn't say anything and when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and my mother said to him, "Thank you for bringing us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>," he said to us, "No.</sentence><sentence id="141">We're not letting you go because you are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="142">You are Jews."</sentence><sentence id="143">And my mother says, "No.</sentence><sentence id="144">I'm not."</sentence><sentence id="145">He says, "Yes, you are.</sentence><sentence id="146">I saw you, how you sighed when you saw them, the Jews walking that <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">And we have to interr...."* My mother started, of course, lying and saying, "no" and tells him the same story that she told the, the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="148">And he says, "No, we have to take you in for interrogation and, and then we'll see what happens and then we'll let you go."</sentence><sentence id="149">So my mother said, "Perhaps I can, you know, give you something.</sentence><sentence id="150">I have some..." you know, some things she had saved whatever. "</sentence><sentence id="151">I'll pay you.</sentence><sentence id="152">Just let us go."</sentence><sentence id="153">And he said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="154">He took us to a little <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> which was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">And we were put in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> maybe was 10 by 10 with other criminals and other robbers and thieves and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="156">They put us in there.</sentence><sentence id="157">And every day, they would take us a few blocks from that <span class="REGION">area</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo office</span> for interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="158">And so they were, you know, asking my mother questions and my sister and, of course, we kept telling them the same story.</sentence><sentence id="159">Nothing -- me they didn't touch.</sentence><sentence id="160">It was just my mother and my sister interrogating to see if they lied or if they were telling the truth.</sentence><sentence id="161">And they just couldn't find anything out and this was already like three, four days.</sentence><sentence id="162">One day they decided that the only way they will be sure to find out if we are Jews are not is if they interrogate me.</sentence><sentence id="163">And I was about five and a half at that time.</sentence><sentence id="164">So they came to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I remember this Gestapo put me on his lap and said to me -- asking me my name which, of course, we changed our names.</sentence><sentence id="165">We changed our identity.</sentence><sentence id="166">We changed everything.</sentence><sentence id="167">And he started telling me what a beautiful little Jewish girl Iam.</sentence><sentence id="168">And I sort of jumped at him.</sentence><sentence id="169">I says, "How can you compare me to a Jewish little girl.</sentence><sentence id="170">I am Christian and I am -- we have nothing to do -- I have nothing to do with Jewish girls.</sentence><sentence id="171">I don't even want to look like them."</sentence><sentence id="172">Well, he kept interrogating me for about an hour and he kept on every second, you know, second word or third word "Jewish little girl, Jewish little girl," and I kept saying you know, "That's not me and we're not and we're just Christians and that's all."</sentence><sentence id="173">Well, after that they realized that you know, they're wrong.</sentence><sentence id="174">That for sure we are from where we told them we were and we were going where we were going, the whole, the whole bit.</sentence><sentence id="175">But then they decided after checking out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that my mother gave them, there was no one under such a name and the address.</sentence><sentence id="176">There was no such address and so on and so forth -- there was no such people.</sentence><sentence id="177">They realized that there was something not right.</sentence><sentence id="178">So they decided to have us interrogated again.</sentence><sentence id="179">So the next day, we were, all of us, walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> going towards the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And of course, there was always a Ukrainian who would be our guard because my mother spoke Ukrainian and one of my sister's friends from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> saw her and she said to her, "You are still alive?"</sentence><sentence id="181">With that, the Ukrainian realized that we have to be Jews.</sentence><sentence id="182">And so after he took us -- he didn't say anything, but after he took us for the next interrogation they decided that we have to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="183">We have to be executed.</sentence><sentence id="184">So they brought us back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">And the way the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was situated was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were our guards.</sentence><sentence id="186">So if you want -- had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span>, you would have to walk into their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, ask for permission and then, you know, either they would go with you because the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> was outside the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or they would, you know, or they would keep one of us like if I wanted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> my mother would go with me, but my sister would remain in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">Or vice versa whichever way.</sentence><sentence id="188">There was always one of us had to stay in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because they were always, I guess, afraid that we'll escape.</sentence><sentence id="189">Well, after hearing between the other inmates that we are going to be killed my mother quickly thought of escaping.</sentence><sentence id="190">And so that evening that we decided to escape we watched the guard that was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to ours.</sentence><sentence id="191">He fell asleep so we couldn't out walk all of us together because we didn't want our inmates to be suspicious of us.</sentence><sentence id="192">So my mother and I started walking out thinking that if he wakes up and asks us where we're going, we going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> and my sister remains in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">But he did not wake up, and we just walked out and as we were going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and you're supposed to turn in to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> the <span class="DLF">front door</span> was open.</sentence><sentence id="194">And so my mother said, "We go."</sentence><sentence id="195">Now there was somebody standing in front of that <span class="DLF">door</span>, but as we came closer to leaving it the man just walked away and we ran away.</sentence><sentence id="196">Now, my mother did tell my sister where we're going to be so when she escapes the same way as we did then we will meet in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where some of our people -- not our people, our neighbors lived and we decided that's where we're going to meet.</sentence><sentence id="197">And it so happened that as my sister started walking out after we had left --- my mother and I had left.</sentence><sentence id="198">She started walking and he woke up and he said to her, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="199">And she says, "I'm going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>."</sentence><sentence id="200">And he says, "Aw, go ahead, your mother's there with your sister."</sentence><sentence id="201">Except he didn't know that we're gone already.</sentence><sentence id="202">And so my sister escaped too.</sentence><sentence id="203">We did meet in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> by the neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="204">And they were hiding us until we decided that the best way to hide will be in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span> where we had a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">And so we told one of our neighbors that we'll be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and so she would once a day bring us something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="206">And the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was like two stories high.</sentence><sentence id="207">And we didn't know, of course, where my father was because he was going to work as an interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="208">We hadn't heard from him and he didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="209">So here we were in our <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and this neighbor was nice enough to bring us food once a day.</sentence><sentence id="210">But obviously somebody noticed that she was carrying food to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and so one day after about three or four days that we were up there sleeping in the -- you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on the what we call it -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and everything -- we just stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="211">Somebody called the SS and they started following the lady.</sentence><sentence id="212">And she realized that, so she started screaming, "Save yourselves.</sentence><sentence id="213">Save yourselves."</sentence><sentence id="214">She never made it to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> but she was just screaming loud enough for us to hear.</sentence><sentence id="215">So my mother and my sister quickly ran to the other end of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and with their bare hands they broke two panels of heavy wood and we jumped, we jumped.</sentence><sentence id="216">From the two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> we jumped down and we started running away.</sentence><sentence id="217">So by the time the Germans broke into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, we were already gone.</sentence><sentence id="218">Now we really hadn't no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go so we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there was, of course, the other Jewish people and my father was there.</sentence><sentence id="219">So we were reunited and we were there again about -- let's see, that was in "41.</sentence><sentence id="220">We were together until the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">pogrom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">Now when they started talking about killing us again, my mother and, of course, with my father, they decided that we have to try and escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always surrounded.</sentence><sentence id="223">It was actually with wires, <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">It was barbed wired and you had guards by the <span class="DLF">entrances</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">So my mother and my father decided that we have to escape.</sentence><sentence id="226">We cannot stay for the second pogrom which was a few months later.</sentence><sentence id="227">So we could not escape together.</sentence><sentence id="228">We had to separate.</sentence><sentence id="229">So my mother took me.</sentence><sentence id="230">We were first to escape at night.</sentence><sentence id="231">We just climbed out between the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and we went to one of our neighbors -- not neighbors, to some friends that we had, Gentiles, which were very nice.</sentence><sentence id="232">Thanks to them, I guess, we're still alive.</sentence><sentence id="233">And then next -- like an hour later, my sister and then we were reunited, my sister and my mother and myself.</sentence><sentence id="234">We waited for my father and he never showed.</sentence><sentence id="235">We didn't know what happened to him, and we couldn't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> either because the following day there was another pogrom.</sentence><sentence id="236">So after that we were always hopeful that we will find our father.</sentence><sentence id="237">In the meantime, we had to escape.</sentence><sentence id="238">We had to run away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because the second pogrom was already meant to clean out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- to clean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> out of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="239">So my mother knew someone.</sentence><sentence id="240">Of course, my mother -- my father also knew this gentlemen who was a motorman on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">And she paid him off, he should smuggle her and my sister out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">Now, like I said before, we didn't know where my father was.</sentence><sentence id="243">Now she could not take me along because "A" I was too little and it was very, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="244">It was in the wintertime.</sentence><sentence id="245">And it was very cold and the clothes that we had really wasn't warm enough.</sentence><sentence id="246">So she made arrangements with a Gentile lady that she should hold, you know, keep me in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until the spring.</sentence><sentence id="247">And then in the springtime this gentlemen who smuggled my sister and my mother out of -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that he will come and he will take me, too, and bring me to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="248">The lady agreed, and my mother gave her whatever we had, you know, just to make sure that I'm safe.</sentence><sentence id="249">She lived -- she had two of her grandchildren living with her.</sentence><sentence id="250">They did not know that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="251">And I don't look Jewish either.</sentence><sentence id="252">And so she kept me in back of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">She had like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, a <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> and that -- this is where I used to stay and I used to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="254">In fact that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> was so infested with, with mice that at night, I used to cover myself with a, with a blanket that she gave me and feel those mice crawling all over me.</sentence><sentence id="255">My mother had left before.</sentence><sentence id="256">But before she left she told me that she has to go away with my sister and she gave me a hundred rubles and she told me that in the springtime this gentlemen whom I knew will come and he'll bring me back to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="257">That it's only going to be a little while and I'm safer staying with this lady and her grandchildren here.</sentence><sentence id="258">My mother left, but before she did I cried.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I said, "I have a headache.</sentence><sentence id="260">Don't leave me."</sentence><sentence id="261">But she said she has to go.</sentence><sentence id="262">I guess I understood.</sentence><sentence id="263">And so she gave me the hundred rubles and I remained in the <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">With her grandchildren, I used to play.</sentence><sentence id="265">After two weeks the lady became a little panicky and she was really afraid to keep a Jewish child in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the Germans notify everyone that if a Jew is found in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> will be burned and the family will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="266">You know, the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="267">So she was really afraid.</sentence><sentence id="268">And so she told me I had to leave her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> two weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="269">Well, at that time I was infested already with lice because nobody gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and I slept in the same clothes and I lived in the same clothes and I lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> with the mice.</sentence><sentence id="270">And so I walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And the first thing I did was go into a -- to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> --a <span class="BUILDING">religious article store</span> and I bought a big cross and I spend my hundred rubles.</sentence><sentence id="272">And then I was so infested with the lice that my head, my skin was all rashes and bloody from scratching it so much.</sentence><sentence id="273">And so I felt that I really needed help and I remembered this lady whom my parents were friendly with and I remembered that we used to visit them every so often.</sentence><sentence id="274">That it's quite a bit outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">I didn't remember the address and I didn't remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="276">But I just remember how we used to walk.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I -- that's how I walked.</sentence><sentence id="278">And I made it to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">And it was winter and cold and the snow was snow maybe five, six inches of snow.</sentence><sentence id="280">And I made it to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and as I got to her <span class="DLF">gate</span> her dog started barking so she came out to see who was at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and she sees me and she says, "My God, Come in quick.</sentence><sentence id="281">Come in quick."</sentence><sentence id="282">And she takes me to her <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> because obviously she must have noticed that I have lice crawling all over me.</sentence><sentence id="283">So she wouldn't take me into her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but she took me into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and she -- quickly she took off my clothes and put on other clothes and she said to me, "Where are your parents?"</sentence><sentence id="284">I said, "Everybody is killed.</sentence><sentence id="285">Everybody is dead."</sentence><sentence id="286">Because I wanted her to have pity on me.</sentence><sentence id="287">And so she did.</sentence><sentence id="288">She took me to her <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">She shaved off my head.</sentence><sentence id="290">She gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">She gave me a glass of hot milk and a piece of black bread.</sentence><sentence id="292">And I ate it so fast that I got so sick that she thought I was dying.</sentence><sentence id="293">And she couldn't call a doctor and she had to pull all her shades down.</sentence><sentence id="294">Nobody should see that she has any strangers in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">And she had a son who was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she didn't want the son to know either because the son did know me and he knew that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="296">So she gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and, and she put on one her -- of her white gowns on me and it really felt good because I felt clean.</sentence><sentence id="297">And she put some Vaseline on my head and she kept me in her <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for a week, a whole week.</sentence><sentence id="298">Now her son didn't know that until one day about three, four days later he said, "Why is your <span class="DLF">bedroom door</span> locked and the shades are down?"</sentence><sentence id="299">And so she felt that she had to tell him, otherwise he might, you know, he might talk about it on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then they'll send the SS and this is what's going to happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="300">So one evening she sort of surprised him.</sentence><sentence id="301">She said to me, "Come in, I want you to see my son and I want him to see you."</sentence><sentence id="302">And when I walked in, he almost died because I was wearing her white gown and my head was shaven.</sentence><sentence id="303">And he just became so wild, but she said to him, "Don't you ever tell anyone that you've seen Frima."</sentence><sentence id="304">And he said, "I promise, I never will."</sentence><sentence id="305">And so I stayed with her for another week.</sentence><sentence id="306">In the meantime, like I told you when she gave me that milk and the bread and I got so sick, she didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="307">So her husband and the lady whom I'm very grateful to, she was giving me enemas because | was already blue in my face.</sentence><sentence id="308">I couldn't talk and I was stopping -- I was slowing down with my breathing.</sentence><sentence id="309">That's how sick I got.</sentence><sentence id="310">Well, after the war she told my mother that as she was trying to save my life she said, "At the same time I was thinking where am I going to bury your child.</sentence><sentence id="311">I mean nobody supposed to know that there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish kad</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="312">But anyway, I guess, God was very good to her and was good to me.</sentence><sentence id="313">After a few enemas, I'm finally -- I woke up and I was stronger and I was able to talk.</sentence><sentence id="314">And after staying a week with her, she said, you know, she can't keep me any longer because she was also afraid that people might become suspicious -- her neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="315">And so here I am without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, without a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go to.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I knew I couldn't go back to that lady who told me to leave the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">So I decided that since she had under her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she had a little -- like a little opening with a <span class="DLF">door</span>, where her dog used to sleep that that's where I'm going to sleep too together with her dog, without her knowing it.</sentence><sentence id="318">And so what I used to do is walk around during the day.</sentence><sentence id="319">Just walk during the day and go to some of the people that I knew and they would give me a piece of bread or give me a potato and I would continue walking and 0 walking and walking.</sentence><sentence id="320">And then at night when it was already dark in the <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span> and it was quiet, I would sneak in.</sentence><sentence id="321">And the dog knew me and he loved me and he didn't even bark.</sentence><sentence id="322">So he used to lie on my legs, keep me warm, and that's how I slept through the night until also very, very early in the morning, I used to get up and pray to God, of course, and put on my kerchief and start walk out from the -- from the -- under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and just walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="323">And one day as I was walking through the same <span class="DLF">streets</span> that I walked before I heard a couple of young boys saying, "Gee, she might be a Jew because I've seen her walking here once before."</sentence><sentence id="324">Well after I heard this, I never walked in that <span class="REGION">area</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="325">I just continued walking to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">And one day I decided to go back in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="327">And we had a cat.</sentence><sentence id="328">It was a Persian cat, beautiful gray, dark gray cat.</sentence><sentence id="329">And I wasn't even near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and the cat recognized me and he started following me.</sentence><sentence id="330">Now the Nazis didn't like cats.</sentence><sentence id="331">And as I was walking and the cat was walking after me meowing and meowing, I couldn't pick him up because they knew that most of the Jewish people had cats.</sentence><sentence id="332">And so I wouldn't pick up my cat.</sentence><sentence id="333">And I just kept walking and he followed me until I was passing the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And there were two guards sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they saw my cat following me and they killed him.</sentence><sentence id="335">They killed my beautiful cat.</sentence><sentence id="336">And I just kept walking as if I didn't know anything and as if I -- the cat did not belong to me.</sentence><sentence id="337">And so I continued walking for about six months.</sentence><sentence id="338">And that was my daily life, sleeping with the dog, walking during the day.</sentence><sentence id="339">And one day when I came back to sleep with the dog, I saw a light on in the <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span> and so I imagined they might be awake and therefore I should not go in, you know, go under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">So next to her there was a bombarded <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="341">There was only four <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">Nothing in it.</sentence><sentence id="343">Full of rubbles and wood and stones and everything.</sentence><sentence id="344">That's where I lay down, between the rubbles and I -- in order to keep warm because it was winter I would blow in my breathing the hot air into my jacket -- in that little jacket.</sentence><sentence id="345">I wore a little jacket, a little skirt, and I had somebody's stockings and that's how I stayed through the night there.</sentence><sentence id="346">And, of course, the next morning I did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="347">I walked out.</sentence><sentence id="348">And I walked again.</sentence><sentence id="349">Then the way that my mother told me that sometimes in the springtime that this gentlemen will come and pick me up and bring me to her, so I knew that when he'll come and ask the lady for me, she'll tell him she doesn't know where I am because she did not know where I am.</sentence><sentence id="350">She did not know that I was sleeping under her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with her dog.</sentence><sentence id="351">So when April came around, I would just circle the <span class="REGION">area</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> so when I see him I would, you know, get in touch with him and he'll be able to take me to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="352">And that's exactly what happened.</sentence><sentence id="353">He came once and she said she doesn't know where I was, but then somehow he decided to come again because my mother told him that this is where I'm going to be, that she is going to keep me until he will, you know, he will come to pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="354">And so one day as soon as I was in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, I saw him and that's how we met.</sentence><sentence id="355">Now he made arrangements and late at night the following day he took me to a <span class="BUILDING">train station 1</span> and he hid me in one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> full of coils.</sentence><sentence id="356">And then in the middle of the night, he transferred me to a different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he just told me to lie on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, which were transported.</sentence><sentence id="357">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German jeeps</span> transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">I met another girl.</sentence><sentence id="359">She was about 10 years my senior and he was smuggling her also.</sentence><sentence id="360">So the two of us were lying on this open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and without knowing that in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeeps</span> there was a German sitting.</sentence><sentence id="361">He was the watchman.</sentence><sentence id="362">And, of course, the gentlemen didn't know either that, you know, the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that we were on that there was danger.</sentence><sentence id="363">And so we're traveling through the night towards <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">Now <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, although it was occupied by the Germans, they had some kind of agreement that the Jews will not be killed.</sentence><sentence id="365">They will live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and work, but they will not be killed unless they're on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">Alright?</sentence><sentence id="367">So it was sort of a little safer for the Jewish people to, to be.</sentence><sentence id="368">We traveled through the night and then at dawn, I hear a <span class="DLF">door</span> open.</sentence><sentence id="369">And the two of us are lying there.</sentence><sentence id="370">Now she had a Jewish accent.</sentence><sentence id="371">So although I was a little younger, I told her not to speak.</sentence><sentence id="372">She has to be quiet and they really wouldn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="373">And we'll just make believe we're sleeping.</sentence><sentence id="374">And we hear, you know, the Germans with those boots, those high boots, just stamping.</sentence><sentence id="375">He was -- came over to us and we just made believe that we don't, we don't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="376">But we were sleeping.</sentence><sentence id="377">But, of course, he kicks me in my back and I made believe I just woke up and he kicks her and he starts yelling in German and I do not speak German.</sentence><sentence id="378">But since I spoke Yiddish I could understand a little bit, but, of course, I wasn't going to speak to him in Yiddish so I just kept saying to him in Russian that we, we lost my -- we lost our mother, and we're looking for my mother and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="379">Anyway, he was furious.</sentence><sentence id="380">He kept yelling in German, and I kept talking to him in Russian and crying, you know, "My mother.</sentence><sentence id="381">My mother.</sentence><sentence id="382">My mother."</sentence><sentence id="383">Well that was early in the morning and then about an hour later or so we were coming closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where we were supposed to get off.</sentence><sentence id="384">Well, he was so furious.</sentence><sentence id="385">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and he made us walk down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">So although I was begging and I was crying and both of us were crying, he wouldn't hear of it.</sentence><sentence id="387">He just told us to get off and he kicked us off, and there we are.</sentence><sentence id="388">And we're standing there and crying and crying and I kept on begging him and begging him and finally I changed his mind.</sentence><sentence id="389">He told us to come up again.</sentence><sentence id="390">And so it didn't take too long.</sentence><sentence id="391">After that we arrived at our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>, and my mother wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="392">Nobody was there.</sentence><sentence id="393">But some people with whom my mother was were there, and this gentlemen who was smuggling us, he brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where he was supposed to meet my mother so she can pay him.</sentence><sentence id="394">Except the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> threw my mother out and my sister because he knew that my mother had some gold pieces which she had saved to pay the gentlemen who smuggled me.</sentence><sentence id="395">And the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wanted that money, of course, for the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="396">So he threw them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">And so when I came there my mother wasn't there any longer.</sentence><sentence id="398">My sister wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="399">And the people told me, you know, that my mother went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which was a couple of hours from that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="400">So they took me to the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was Jewish and his wife -- they had no children and I was crying and asking him, "Where's my mother.</sentence><sentence id="401">I want to be with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="402">Take me to my mother."</sentence><sentence id="403">And he said -- and he was trying to convince me that my life will be so much better if I stayed with them and I won't be 2 missing anything and I'll have dolls and I'll have toys and I'll have everything.</sentence><sentence id="404">And I kept saying, "I want my mother.</sentence><sentence id="405">I want my mother.</sentence><sentence id="406">Please get me back to my mother."</sentence><sentence id="407">So finally he said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="408">And they -- there was what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="409"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Horse</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> going every -- once a day to different little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where, you know, some of the people lived there.</sentence><sentence id="410">So he got me on one of those little, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> with a horse.</sentence><sentence id="411">There were few men, and I was the only child with them.</sentence><sentence id="412">And as we were traveling through the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, there were always, always like groups of --I don't know if you call them bandits or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="413">They were always used to look for Jewish people and beat them up and take everything away from them cause that's -- I guess, that's how they made a living.</sentence><sentence id="414">I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="415">Well, they stopped our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and they started taking all the men off, because they knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="416">When I saw this, I jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and I kept running, running toward the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">Now this was springtime.</sentence><sentence id="418">And at that time the harvest, they build those what do you call them?</sentence><sentence id="419">You know, they bunched up the harvest so there was a little -- like little <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> and I hid in one of those, and I was sitting there and thinking, "Where do I go from here?"</sentence><sentence id="420">And I was praying and then hours -- a couple of hours later I heard horses coming in my direction.</sentence><sentence id="421">And I was sure that they were looking for me, and that they were going to get me.</sentence><sentence id="422">So I decided before I run to different haystacks -- exactly haystacks -- I should look out and see, you know, what is happening.</sentence><sentence id="423">Well, when I looked out I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the horse, and the men on it.</sentence><sentence id="424">And so I ran towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, and they were, of course, very happy to see me and they kept saying how those bandits were looking for me because they noticed a little girl and I had escaped.</sentence><sentence id="425">So they were very angry because those men were beaten.</sentence><sentence id="426">Everything was taken away from them.</sentence><sentence id="427">And they were all injured, all beaten, but anyway they took me up and they hugged me and they kissed me.</sentence><sentence id="428">And we finally made it to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where my mother was -- were assembled a couple hundred of Jewish people there.</sentence><sentence id="429">And that was before Passover.</sentence><sentence id="430">And when the word passed around that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> came with some men and a little girl, my mother and my sister knew that it had to be me so, of course, they ran out to greet me.</sentence><sentence id="431">And that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they was -- it was so little that actually the Germans knew where the Jews lived so they didn't have to surround it or, you know, put up barbed wire or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="432">We lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with this Gentile man.</sentence><sentence id="433">We had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> and all three of us slept on it.</sentence><sentence id="434">And there was -- then there was another mother and a daughter that slept on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">We worked in his <span class="DLF">fields</span> to pay him for sort of rent so my mother and my sister worked on the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I worked on the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">My job was digging out potatoes and carrying them to his <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, and for this I would get a loaf of bread a day.</sentence><sentence id="437">That was very good.</sentence><sentence id="438">We are very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="439">We remained living there for about a year, at least a year -- I'd say 40 -- deg42 -- for about a year.</sentence><sentence id="440">And we kept working and then the day before we were liberated, the Germans had dug another <span class="DLF">grave</span>, a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> to kill all of us, like the Final Solution.</sentence><sentence id="441">And the day before their plan, the Russians were bombarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was street 3 fighting going on and we were saved except for those Jewish people who either got killed because their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were, you know, where they stayed.</sentence><sentence id="442">It wasn't their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, but wherever they lived, either the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was bombarded or because of the street fighting or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="443">Well, we were lucky to survive.</sentence><sentence id="444">And we went back to look for our father.</sentence><sentence id="445">And all we, the news we had is that he was seen with two Gestapos walking the <span class="DLF">street</span>, down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we never heard from him.</sentence><sentence id="446">And we didn't know that you know, all my aunts and uncles and grandparents and cousins, they're all killed.</sentence><sentence id="447">And we started to build up a new life.</sentence><sentence id="448">My mother was the widow who tried to put our lives together.</sentence><sentence id="449">And so she was selling and buying and selling and trying to make a go of it.</sentence><sentence id="450">The shoes that I was wearing -- we couldn't afford to buy anything, so I would go between the destroyed <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and rubbles and pick up rope and with a crochet needle I would crochet slippers and then put a piece of cardboard.</sentence><sentence id="451">And these were the shoes I wore.</sentence><sentence id="452">And, God, that's how we lived until we decided that everyone else is dead, no one is left, that we have to start a new life, and just leave Europe.</sentence><sentence id="453">And so we joined other Jewish people who hoped that we can escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="454">That was the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="455">We can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> perhaps we can go to different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">And so we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
