<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Yes, I had a cousin named Erik Forst(ph), who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but he moved to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1939, so he was not a prisoner in any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camps</span> like his family was.</sentence><sentence id="538">So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I do not know where.</sentence><sentence id="539">But all of a sudden he started showing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>, and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something.</sentence><sentence id="540">Now what do I mean by that?</sentence><sentence id="541">He was dressed in -- in boots, high thigh boots.</sentence><sentence id="542">He was dir -- dressed in -- in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants.</sentence><sentence id="543">He was dressed in a shirt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret.</sentence><sentence id="544">And people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing.</sentence><sentence id="545">So over the years as I got older, I-"ve always want --I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years later.</sentence><sentence id="546">And I wondered over the</sentence><sentence id="548">years, you know, what was this all about?</sentence><sentence id="549">But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and he could have sa -- he had safe passage in and out of the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> and no one stopped him or challenged him.</sentence><sentence id="550">So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him.</sentence><sentence id="551">But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and his plan was to plan an escape for us.</sentence><sentence id="552">So one dark night, my parents and I and my father's brother Leopold, and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and my father gave the French -- the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back.</sentence><sentence id="553">And we went through the barbed wife, down a short <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and to a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> where my cousin Erik had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> and a driver waiting, and we piled into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="555">So that was eight people in -- in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, I'm sure we were a tight fit.</sentence><sentence id="556">And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumieres, fermer les lumieres, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him.</sentence><sentence id="557">And we drove for two nights, in the daytime we hid.</sentence><sentence id="558">And eventually we reached a</sentence><sentence id="560">small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caussade</span>, where cousin Erik had picked out a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> for us to hide in and live.</sentence><sentence id="561">And we had, on this small <span class="DLF">farm</span> we had, which was on top of a <span class="DLF">hill</span>, we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner.</sentence><sentence id="562">And we grew food, we grew -- grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we su- subsisted on that <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">And we were on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of different French police types started to show up.</sentence><sentence id="564">And my parents, seeing them come up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> from below, ordered me to go lay in the <span class="DLF">corn field</span> and hide, they shouldn't count all -- be able to count all of us.</sentence><sentence id="565">And one day there was so many of them that came, that -- and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the <span class="DLF">cornfield</span>, and when they had left, my parents couldn't find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the -- finally I woke up.</sentence><sentence id="566">But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea -- rearrested all of us and sent us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rivesaltes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> they had another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">Within the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> they had another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and they put the men in my family in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="569">And it was extraordinary and I remember that very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
