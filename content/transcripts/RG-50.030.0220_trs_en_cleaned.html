<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Well, the general situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> before the 2nd World War - <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> was an independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from 1918 to 1940.</sentence><sentence id="32">And even though there was some anti-Semitism prevalent, the Jewish people had had many cultural activities.</sentence><sentence id="33">We we had many <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">We had <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museums</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theaters</span> and a very active cultural and social life.</sentence><sentence id="35">my father and mother worked very very hard in order to provide a decent standard of living to the family and give their children the best possible education.</sentence><sentence id="36">We went to <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span>. ,</sentence><sentence id="37">as a matter of fact <span class="BUILDING">private German schools</span> until 1933 when Hitler came to power.</sentence><sentence id="38">Then all the Jewish people demonstratively took their children out of the <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> and I started attending the Hebrew 01:03: <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Gymnasion Ivrith, and I visited the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">I was attending the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until 1940.My brother went to a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was called <span class="BUILDING">Ezra School</span> which was also, was not Hebrew but it was also diversified in various languages.</sentence><sentence id="40">And we we had a very interesting social life.</sentence><sentence id="41">We belonged to a Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="42">we were very much interested in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and most of our young people used to volunteer to go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> whenever possible.</sentence><sentence id="43">And we were strong supporters of the Zionist movement at that time.</sentence><sentence id="44">Our social life was very active and we had really had a nice a nice growing up period.</sentence><sentence id="45">And all this of course changed when in 1940, when the Soviet Union occupied our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">overnight things were not the same anymore.</sentence><sentence id="47">first of all my father lost his <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">There was no private enterprise allowed under any circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="49">One day somebody came into our <span class="BUILDING">business</span> and asked my father for the key and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="50">And my father had to go and work in the <span class="BUILDING">lumber factory</span>, after all those years trying to build the business and provide a future for his family - all of a sudden everything was gone.</sentence><sentence id="51">All our Zionist organizations were closed immediately.</sentence><sentence id="52">It was forbidden to have any kind of nationalist groups under threat of incarceration.</sentence><sentence id="53">Even the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> were closed because the Soviet Union does not recognize Hebrew as as a Jewish language.</sentence><sentence id="54">That that is nationalist and anything which is nationalist is forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="55">So life changed dramatically.</sentence><sentence id="56">In addition they they arrested five thousand prominent Jewish families from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and sent them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, their only crime being that they were capitalists.</sentence><sentence id="57">They had large business and all that.</sentence><sentence id="58">And that took all of 1940 until 1941.</sentence><sentence id="59">we had heard, we had heard already about things transpiring in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">We had heard rumor about persecution against Jews, even Jews being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and all that, but nobody really believed that these things would lead eventually to mass murder or mass persecutions against Jews, so when when the war finally broke out on the end of June, June 22nd, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war on the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="61">the German army swept through the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span>, within eight days occupied the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> and there was very little time to make up one's mind whether to stay behind or to leave with the retreating Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="62">We had a discussion about it in our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and my father felt very very strongly that it is a temporary situation.</sentence><sentence id="63">Yes, there might be some privileges which will be taken away from the Jews and there might be a certain amount of persecutions, but nobody in their right mind could ever imagine what was to come, so my father said we're going to stick it out.</sentence><sentence id="64">We're going to stay.</sentence><sentence id="65">So we did - that's the reason why we stayed behind.</sentence><sentence id="66">Some of our friends left with the Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="67">the men were taken immediately into the Army and most of them died fighting the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="68">Some of them were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">Some of them were sent to <span class="REGION">inner Russia</span> and some of them survived and came back after the war.</sentence><sentence id="70">The minute the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and particularly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> on July Ist, 1941, the Latvian population, the Latvian civilian population, turned against their neighbors, the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="71">Anti-Semitism, as I said, was always prevalent, but the year occupation by the Soviet Union increased anti-Semitism by so much because as usual the Jews were used as a scapegoat and the Latvian civilian population accused the Jews of being the culprit of bringing communism to their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And that is why immediately, when the Russians pulled out, the German civilian population started persecution, persecuting Jews.</sentence><sentence id="73">They, before even the Germans had a chance to institute any kind of change, the the Latvians used to sweep through the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, used to drag people out, used to murder, plunder, rape, everything, in the last, even the last the first few days.</sentence><sentence id="74">In this, in the first few weeks, our family was lucky because we had a maid who was living with us and she used to go out and do all the shopping for us, so we didn't have to venture into the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, which was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="75">And she used to go buy food for us and and help us as much as she could.</sentence><sentence id="76">But then came out orders that every Jew was supposed to wear the star, the yellow star of David, left front and center back.</sentence><sentence id="77">And we were not allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">Like cattle we were driven into the <span class="DLF">gutter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">Not allowed to go to <span class="DLF">parks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">Not allowed anything.</sentence><sentence id="81">It was a very very sad and nervous time because Jews were continuously, continuously arrested, taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">Most of them never came back.</sentence><sentence id="83">Few later, a few weeks later, an order came out that all Jews have to get ready to be moved from their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> into specially designated <span class="REGION">area</span> called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">It was supposed to be in a dilapidated section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where about four thousand poor Russian and Polish families lived.</sentence><sentence id="85">They vacated the <span class="REGION">premises</span> and in their <span class="NPIP">place</span> thirty thousand Jews were brought.</sentence><sentence id="86">All we all we were allowed to take is what we could carry in small little hand-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">By October we all were supposed to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were closed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: How did your family prepare to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Well, we knew that there was really no possibility for us to do anything but to follow orders because the majority, the overwhelming majority of the Latvian civilian population, didn't have any kind of feelings for their neighbors, the Jews who who who who were struck with this particular disaster.</sentence><sentence id="151">And there was no chance of getting help from anybody.</sentence><sentence id="152">So when the day came, we just, sad as it was, packed up a few little things which we could carry and we - I remember the day very well.</sentence><sentence id="153">It was about a mile and a half from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and we carried a few pieces each and had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> which we pushed and took a few bare necessities, what we could carry, and we made the transition from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of course, the situation was disastrous because we had to share - in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to share with another family.</sentence><sentence id="155">One <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">Every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, a two or three room apartment usually was occupied by six or seven families.</sentence><sentence id="157">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was guarded on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> by the Latvian military guards.</sentence><sentence id="158">We had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> a civilian administration which was in charge of the sanitation, in charge of police, employment agency and whatever, and every morning people used to line up and the German or Latvian guards came and took people to work.</sentence><sentence id="159">At night they used to bring them back.</sentence><sentence id="160">my mother, my brother and I were working at that time for a German police unit called BDO, which is translated into German: "Befehlshaber der Ordnungspolizei".</sentence><sentence id="161">We were, my brother and I were doing menial labor.</sentence><sentence id="162">My mother was working for the for the chief in in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">She cooking for his family, which enabled her once in a while to get some extra food to help to support the family.</sentence><sentence id="164">My father of course stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he did the the the menial chores in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in so far and so at night we used to come back, but all this took a very very short time.</sentence><sentence id="165">That is from October till November.</sentence><sentence id="166">On November 27th, the orders came out that people who live in a certain section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> supposed to line up on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> the next morning and they will be sent to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">And of course all kinds of rumors started sweeping the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">Nobody was sure what's to come and everybody was concerned and worried and but then, after lining up on the 27th, they sent every...everybody <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="169">But a day later, on the 29th, thousands of Latvian and German police came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, drunk, most of them drunk - shooting, chasing everybody out.</sentence><sentence id="170">Raus.</sentence><sentence id="171">Everybody raus.</sentence><sentence id="172">Schnell, schnell.</sentence><sentence id="173">They chased everybody out.</sentence><sentence id="174">Whoever couldn't walk was shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="175">Children, women, elderly men, on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And German officers were walking around and telling the elderly and the weak and the ones who couldn't walk very well that they will provide transportation for them.</sentence><sentence id="177">They, it would be much easier for them and they provided special blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">At that time we did not know what was happening to them, but they were chased through certain sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbola</span> and there Russian prisoners of war had prepared large <span class="DLF">graves</span>, <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>, and when the people got there they were told to undress, put their shoe in one pile their shoes in one pile, clothing in another pile, driven to the edges of this <span class="DLF">mass grave</span>, and machine-gunned.</sentence><sentence id="179">It was going on all night and the next day.</sentence><sentence id="180">Fifteen thousand of our people were massacred in that particular day.</sentence><sentence id="181">My brother and I were taken with a group of other men and told to go to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they established a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of four thousand able-bodied men, and we were immediately separated from the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">My father chose to stay at that time with my mother, but somehow - they lived in a different part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so they were spared the first murder.</sentence><sentence id="183">It didn't last long however, and on December 8th, they started the same thing all over again.</sentence><sentence id="184">And my father came over to visit my my brother and myself, wanted to go back and all of a sudden they closed, they closed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was stuck.</sentence><sentence id="185">He couldn't go back to my mother because he really wanted to be with my mother, so that's how my father stayed with us, and that particular day my mother with most of the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were taken out.</sentence><sentence id="186">Another eleven thousand, five hundred were massacred.</sentence><sentence id="187">There was another small Aktion the next day of five hundred.</sentence><sentence id="188">There were within a very short time, two weeks, twenty-seven thousand people massacred.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: How did you hear about your mother's death and what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, as a matter of fact we, even after it happened, we were not sure.</sentence><sentence id="232">There were all kinds of rumors circulating what had happened to them, because the civilian population we didn't have any contact with.</sentence><sentence id="233">We didn't know for sure what was happened.</sentence><sentence id="234">All we knew that my mother was taken away in the second aktion with another eleven thousand five hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="235">We were still hoping against hope that maybe it was some kind of a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> where she was taken to.</sentence><sentence id="236">Nobody was sure but but after a while, the the real picture started emerging - that it it was just a disaster, that they were just murdered and there was no hope of anybody coming back.</sentence><sentence id="237">And of course my father and us were totally devastated.</sentence><sentence id="238">A lot of tears, a lot of crying, saying kaddish after my mother, but really there was not, nothing nothing much one could do at those those at this time.</sentence><sentence id="239">I remember while they were taking out those people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I was standing behind the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and I saw those wild animals, those drunk Latvian and German soldiers beating, killing in the most brutal and barbaric way.</sentence><sentence id="240">I saw a woman walking with a child, with a baby in her arms, and somehow she slipped and the baby fell out of her arms.</sentence><sentence id="241">The Latvian policeman grabbed the baby, held it by its legs and put a bullet through the head, and when the mother started pleading with him and crying, he shot the mother on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="242">I saw that just in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="243">So when I saw that I had no doubt in my mind what was happening to our people.</sentence><sentence id="244">And it was the futility of the situation which made me raise my eyes to the <span class="DLF">sky</span>, say my God, it just cannot be.</sentence><sentence id="245">Human beings cannot do that to other people.</sentence><sentence id="246">It's just impossible.</sentence><sentence id="247">Day had turned to night.</sentence><sentence id="248">People became worse than animals, blood-thirsty without any pity, any feelings for their fellow human beings, and the Latvian civilian population and I must get the record straight, the overwhelming majority of them just couldn't care less.</sentence><sentence id="249">They were hanging out the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and they knew what was going on, and the majority of them couldn't care less.</sentence><sentence id="250">Yes, there was some exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="251">A few people even risked their lives to help their fellow Jews.</sentence><sentence id="252">But a percentage and it was so minute and so small that it really doesn't amount to anything.</sentence><sentence id="253">After these big exterminations of November and December, life went on in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where just four thousand of us able-bodied men were left, and a few hundred women were kept in a special <span class="BUILDING">house</span> away from us.</sentence><sentence id="254">Then the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> started arriving.</sentence><sentence id="255">The majority of them were sent immediately to their death.</sentence><sentence id="256">Some of them were brought to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the in the place of of our people who were executed.</sentence><sentence id="257">And every day new shipments kept arriving.</sentence><sentence id="258">And as time went on, we got to know them, and in the beginning there was a certain understandable resentment from the Latvian Jews because somehow we felt that we had to make room for them, and when when you are emotionally overwhelmed by happenings, you don't think rational and you blame the the new arrivals to to a certain extent about what had transpired.</sentence><sentence id="259">But soon we became friends with them and even though we were separated by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>, we had contacts with them being that they had also women and girls, and in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was only men.</sentence><sentence id="260">The contact came, used to be boyfriend-girlfriend relationships and all that, and a certain amount of social life under those primitive circumstances took place.</sentence><sentence id="261">My brother and I, who used to in in in in pre-war times belong to a band, used to come to, on Sundays we used to go the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> used to call it, and have social meetings and and sing and and even dance a little bit, just, you know, just to pass the time away, and , you know, life was going on and everybody was trying to do the best he could under the circumstances. (</sentence><sentence id="262">pause) A lot of my friends from from pre-war friends volunteered to join the Jewish police force in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">The Jewish police force was there for the purpose of keeping order within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">They had no weapons of course, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="265">They just keep order, make sure that the sanitation is properly done, that they that they maintain order.</sentence><sentence id="266">There there's no criminal activities whatsoever, and my first reaction, my brother's and I when they asked for volunteers, we wanted very much to volunteer for that too, because it meant have a uniform, have a little bit larger rations of food, not to have to go to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, be inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and all that, but my father, God bless him, was very much against it.</sentence><sentence id="267">He says I don't want you to volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="268">Just do whatever you have do, do your work, and don't be in the forefront and try to keep a low profile.</sentence><sentence id="269">Little did we know that indirectly that saved our lives later on because as life was 01:25: going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and as our situation started to become hopeless, some people started thinking of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="270">I was not directly involved but I knew about it because I had a cousin in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who was directly involved.</sentence><sentence id="271">They were smuggling guns and other military equipment into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, with the sole purpose of whenever it comes to it, that we will not go to the slaughter voluntarily.</sentence><sentence id="272">We'll fight back as much as we can.</sentence><sentence id="273">As it happens many times, somehow the Germans got wind of it.</sentence><sentence id="274">And till today we still don't know exactly how, but the fact is they came in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> one day, and they discovered the arms.</sentence><sentence id="275">And immediately everybody who was there in that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="276">So were many other ones, and nobody ever saw them anymore.</sentence><sentence id="277">And a week later, they took, they lined up the whole police force of forty-five young, of our youngest and bravest men, most of them were close friends of mine, and the German officer who was in charge of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> said to them that they're holding them directly responsible for not maintaining order in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And they took them out to a to a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they machined them all, machine-gunned them all to death, forty-five of them.</sentence><sentence id="279">One of them escaped somehow, but later on they caught him too, so not one of them is alive today.</sentence><sentence id="280">One night when I came back from work with my brother, we heard the news.</sentence><sentence id="281">And it was devastating, but we first realized that by not letting us join this police force my father had saved our lives at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="282">So life was progressing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">On and off they would come again and take away so many hundreds of people -

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="399">Q: What kind of things did you try to get them to join you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="401">A: Well, there always used to be some contact with with Kaiserwald, and I used to try to get some messages to them to try to volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="402">The minute they asked for volunteers to come to us, to volunteer to come to our to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">Also every couple of weeks they used to take from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> people who had to go to the dentist, problems with their teeth - the dentist was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span>, and what he would do is when you used to come with a toothache he just would pull your tooth, and when I heard about this I volunteered.</sentence><sentence id="404">I said [had a toothache and I volunteered because I wanted to see my brother and my father and see them personally.</sentence><sentence id="405">So that morning when I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">clothing depot</span> I took some socks from the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="406">I hid them underneath my pants and at night we were lined up, a kommando of about fifteen, twenty people ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="407">Low and behold we were stopped at the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">Germans control.</sentence><sentence id="409">When I heard that I knew that I'm going to have a lot of difficulties to say the least, and I had to get rid of those (pause) socks.</sentence><sentence id="410">I was able to establish contact with a German, not with a German - it was a Latvian guard outside the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and I told him in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvian</span>, I have some socks.</sentence><sentence id="411">Take them.</sentence><sentence id="412">Keep them.</sentence><sentence id="413">He did.</sentence><sentence id="414">I was able to sneak the socks to him and get rid of them.</sentence><sentence id="415">However when I looked at my group, all of a sudden there were some socks which somebody else had thrown down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and I had told the people who were with us, fellow Jews, that I was carrying some socks for my brother and my father, so the people felt that they were my socks, and when I told them that I got rid of my socks they didn't believe me.</sentence><sentence id="416">And when the Germans saw the socks laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, they said who, who do they belong to.</sentence><sentence id="417">In the beginning I wasn't going to volunteer because I, there was no reason for me.</sentence><sentence id="418">They wasn't mine.</sentence><sentence id="419">But I was pressured in into admit, to confess by my fellow Jews because they really felt that it was mine and they said if I'm not going to volunteer, everybody was going to be punished.</sentence><sentence id="420">I had no choice, and I stepped forward and I said they were mine.</sentence><sentence id="421">And next, immediately I was given a merciless beating.</sentence><sentence id="422">I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="423">I was dragged to a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where they used to keep the people before execution.</sentence><sentence id="424">I was almost unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="425">I was thrown into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I blacked out.</sentence><sentence id="426">A couple of hours later I must have woken up.</sentence><sentence id="427">It was still completely dark.</sentence><sentence id="428">It was night and first I did not realize what had transpired.</sentence><sentence id="429">Slowly it started coming back to me and I started to realize that I was doomed.</sentence><sentence id="430">People were executed for much less than that.</sentence><sentence id="431">I just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="432">I was bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="433">I was holding my head.</sentence><sentence id="434">I was aching all over, but I just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="435">I was twenty years old, and I just couldn't believe that this was going to the end.</sentence><sentence id="436">All kinds of thoughts started flashing through my mind - the kind of life I was hoping to build one day for myself and it all goes down the <span class="DLF">drain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="437">It's not going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="438">An hour later I heard footsteps nearing the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> where I was incarcerated.</sentence><sentence id="439">I was a hundred percent sure they were Germans coming to execute me.</sentence><sentence id="440">The <span class="DLF">door</span> swung open and there were two Germans, officers in uniform and the camp elder, the Jew who was the camp elder.</sentence><sentence id="441">His name was David Kagan, and as they entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, before the Germans had a chance to draw their guns, the camp Aeltester started beating me, saying you lousy son of a gun, he says.</sentence><sentence id="442">How dare you to steal from the Germans, and kicked me and beat me and kicked me and beat me.</sentence><sentence id="443">I started bleeding profusely from all over my body and he beat me into unconsciousness.</sentence><sentence id="444">But somehow, ironically, that saved my life.</sentence><sentence id="445">He beat me so much that the Germans assumed that I was dead or close to dead.</sentence><sentence id="446">They just turned around and walked out, which I was told later because I was unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="447">I was laying in this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> for another two or three days and then finally the camp elder came and got me and took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it is something which I have never forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="448">Mr.Kagan who did not have a very good reputation from everybody because a lot of people felt that he was too strict and sometimes too merciless, but I must, if I want to be honest I really have to admit that if not for him I wouldn't be alive today.</sentence><sentence id="449">Another few months passed.</sentence><sentence id="450">It was 1944 now.</sentence><sentence id="451">And even though we did not have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> or any newspapers, the news kept trickling in to us that the tide of the war had turned.</sentence><sentence id="452">The Russians had won the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and the Germans were starting to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="453">And of course for us it meant some kind of a glimmer of hope.</sentence><sentence id="454">Perhaps, perhaps the Russians will be liberating us before the Germans have a chance to kill us.</sentence><sentence id="455">In the meantime, periodically the Germans would come into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, line everybody up in front of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where one of the Germans would sit.</sentence><sentence id="456">Everybody had to undress naked and walk in front of him, and if there was something he would like on your body, any scar or anything like that, you went to the left, and left meant certain death.</sentence><sentence id="457">And my father who was an invalid and who was with us at that time yet still on many occasions he would have been doomed if he wouldn't have somehow we're able to save him by not letting him go into the <span class="DLF">line</span>, by sneaking him out.</sentence><sentence id="458">When once I remember my father was taken out and and sent to the left, and he was still standing there and waiting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to take him away, and the German guard was walking back and forth, and as he turned his back I snuck in.</sentence><sentence id="459">I grabbed my father and pulled him out of there which at that time saved his life.</sentence><sentence id="460">So my brother and I and my father were still in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when 19...when the fall of 1944 came, and that was when we started already hearing rumors that the Russians were getting closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="461">And one day we woke up and we heard already the Russian guns and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> and we could, you know, we were starting to to have hope against hope that maybe, maybe salvation is near.</sentence><sentence id="462">If I were what is what is it was not meant to be.</sentence><sentence id="463">It was not meant to be.</sentence><sentence id="464">We were all driven out of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, lined up with the Germans and taken to the <span class="DLF">port</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> was standing by, and we chased on to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferries</span> and taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> to

the few remaining Jews because they were, it was clear to them by this time they were loosing the war.</sentence><sentence id="471">A few weeks after we arrived in <span

id="927">A few years back, quite a few years back, my dear friend Mr. Max Kaufmann who was the mainstay of Latvian Jews in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, Mr. Max Kaufmann wrote a book about the destruction of Latvian Jewry about five years after the liberation and this book has been served, served as reference to many historians and many people who wrote books after

very very strongly when people ask me how come that so many died and and you didn't.</sentence><sentence id="939">Usually I feel, I answer is first of all it was a certain amount of luck.</sentence><sentence id="940">You had to have luck because no matter what you did, nobody can resist a bullet, but I also felt that a lot had to do with the fact that I was young and strong and also most important I felt that it was meant to be and I maybe I had a mission.</sentence><sentence id="941">Because I was fortunate enough to survive, I have a responsibility and mission to do my very best to try to tell the world what was done to us and what man's inhumanity can do, where hate and bigotry can lead to.</sentence><sentence id="942">When we start looking around us today, we are witnessing the awakening of anti-Semitism, of national anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union to a point where the million six hundred thousand Jews in the Soviet Union, they do not feel safe anymore.</sentence><sentence id="943">It's not anymore a question of looking for a better life.</sentence><sentence id="944">It's a question of being frightened.</sentence><sentence id="945">I have

rearing its ugly head again.</sentence><sentence id="947">And therefore I feel it's twice as important now not to leave one stone unturned to make the world aware of what is happening and to try and do everything possible not to let the same mistake to happen again, where the whole world stood by indifferently and watched our people being slaughtered.</sentence><sentence id="948">I feel as long as I possibly can I would love to go on with this important work whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, whether it's in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> or in the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="949">Wherever I have a chance and opportunity to get involved I'm sure going to try.</sentence></p></dialogue>
