class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: What did they mean?</sentence><sentence id="58">What were they expecting of you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Well, I've seen it, I've seen the paper, I've seen the paper in their hand.</sentence><sentence id="60">These were actually Wehrmacht guards by now, so most of the SS guards ran away.</sentence><sentence id="61">But as we were marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans -- last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.073341" long="10.908635">Landsberg</span>, we were supposedly marching towards the <span

behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw "em in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, so nobody was -- be left on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">And this piece of pa -- they wrote these pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they were marching.</sentence><sentence id="64">Here, would you mind -- would you sign this for me, and tell them that I was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food.</sentence><sentence id="65">Some people did sign.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="66">I've seen

done.</sentence><sentence id="69">So this was the death march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were -- were falling like flies.</sentence><sentence id="70">I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of -- of the slave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better.</sentence><sentence id="71">So, during this death march there was also a American Air Force air raid on a <span class="BUILDING">munition depot</span> very close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiirzburg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And from there as the -- th -- as the Americans were bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped.</sentence><sentence id="73">And soon after I was picked up by the United States Armed Forces.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="77"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>, RG-50.549.02*0007 5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Th-Th-The questions I'm going to ask you in the next few minutes are very disparate, they're -- they're -- they're not in chronology necessarily, but they're, again, picking up on things that you mentioned before.</sentence><sentence id="79">Did you ever get over your fear of doctors and dentists?</sentence><sentence id="80">You referred to that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Unfortunately not.</sentence><sentence id="82">I -- from day -- from -- ever since I've been out of the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> -- when I met my wife, I got married, I had -- I had problem with my teeth.</sentence><sentence id="83">You know, there -- there is saying, your teeth are alright, but your gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid.</sentence><sentence id="84">Once -- I once ran away from a dentist in the army.</sentence><sentence id="85">I don't know if I ever s -- mentioned that to -- to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">I was taken by another -- another G.I. with -- to -- to go to the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I ran away from there.</sentence><sentence id="88">I'm still scared of dentists, I'm still deathly afraid of shots.</sentence><sentence id="89">Pll tell you an -- a little story about what happened to me a few years ago.</sentence><sentence id="90">As I mentioned to you before, I wa -- I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a referee, but as a player.</sentence><sentence id="91">I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he opened my f-- my forehead.</sentence><sentence id="92">I ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And a friend of mine, the one I showed you on the picture in -- in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then they called my wife to come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">They wanted to give me a tetanus shot.</sentence><sentence id="95">I would re -- I refused it, I would -- I fought it.</sentence><sentence id="96">My wife almost left me because of that, she was so upset with me.</sentence><sentence id="97">That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a <span class="DLF">door</span>, and the hor -- <span class="DLF">door</span> had a little steel [indecipherable] I was -- and doctors fear is</sentence><sentence id="99"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>, RG-50.549.02*0007 6 still there.</sentence><sentence id="100">When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to you.</sentence><sentence id="101">Very much so, even today.</sentence><sentence id="102">I'm afraid of when they look for po -- prostrate, you know, when they do th -- do that little finger job on you.</sentence><sentence id="103">That scares me, that scares the hell out of me.</sentence><sentence id="104">When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me.</sentence><sentence id="105">So that fear is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, unfortunately, because I've seen Mengele e-e-every day on th --on---on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn't, they really shouldn't, not today.</sentence><sentence id="107">And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician.</sentence><sentence id="108">But I'm still afra -- a-afraid of it. "</sentence><sentence id="109">m very much so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that?</sentence><sentence id="141">Have you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: N-No.</sentence><sentence id="143">See, there are two things that I am afraid of.</sentence><sentence id="144">Doctors and dentists is two, and I'm also afraid of water.</sentence><sentence id="145">Water scares me for the simple reason because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once.</sentence><sentence id="146">Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they caught me es -- organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they send you to a sin 0-0-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph).</sentence><sentence id="147">Sin -- sin -- sin commando, which meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">We had a chain -- chainsaw like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it, was like a sickle, which would cut it.</sentence><sentence id="149">And there would be a kapo(ph) -- a--a [indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a -- a person who was in charge of us behind us with the SS man, and they would dunk our heads in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and kept us there until we could not breathe any more.</sentence><sentence id="150">So I--1--I went through that for a couple of weeks as a -- a-a-as a shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="151">So whenever -- whenever we go to a</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="166"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>, RG-50.549.02*0007 7 <span class="DLF">beach</span> or something, I only go up to my knees.</sentence><sentence id="167">And not one of my children, of the four kids, were swimmers, because of me.</sentence><sentence id="168">And of course, now they are learning a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="169">Some of them are -- a couple of them are still afraid.</sentence><sentence id="170">Arsani's(ph) a swimmer now, his ti--his children are a swimmer.</sentence><sentence id="171">Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was always deathly afraid of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, because of the -- because of me.</sentence><sentence id="172">So those are the things that scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Makes sense.</sentence><sentence id="181">I'm gonna re-rearrange the microphone so it's a little less bothersome for you and you can move around better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Can you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: It's fine, it's -- that just gives you a little more free reign.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Although it's off s -- the chronology a little bit here, I would like t-- well, Pll come back to this, th-the -- how you think -- what you -- how you think your children have been affected by what happened to you is something I would like to talk to you about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Do you -- you want to talk to me about it now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Well --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: All right, we're there, so let's -- let's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: All right, let's -- the children, our children.</sentence><sentence id="196">Well, when I arrived to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, May 10", 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most survivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff -- in a--i-ina--ina</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="201"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>, RG-50.549.02*0007 8 different way.</sentence><sentence id="202">I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very helpful that I had an aunt living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">So when I first met my wife, my future wife, we started dating, we -- also a survivor, you know.</sentence><sentence id="204">She didn't have much family, I didn't have any family, so you lonely, I'm lonely, let's be lonely together, the old saying what is the -- one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase.</sentence><sentence id="205">So when we got married, February 224, 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next -- th-this February, I asked my wife, why don't we -- let's not talk any more any other language except English.</sentence><sentence id="206">My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language, which was not the cleanest language in those days, of course.</sentence><sentence id="207">That's how I learned.</sentence><sentence id="208">And we decided -- she was a little bit against it.</sentence><sentence id="209">She said no, we should talk to the children other languages also.</sentence><sentence id="210">She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the kids today could have -- although they speak some languages, but they could -- today they could have learned much more.</sentence><sentence id="211">So, how did it affect my children?</sentence><sentence id="212">First, we wouldn't talk about our experiences.</sentence><sentence id="213">Another mistake we made -- I made, anyway, it was -- I'm -- I'm taking the blame for that.</sentence><sentence id="214">Reason we didn't want to, why hurt them?Why let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through?</sentence><sentence id="215">But the kids knew they were different.</sentence><sentence id="216">Our children soon, as soon as they started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> found out they were different.</sentence><sentence id="217">Number one, they didn't have any first cousins.</sentence><sentence id="218">They didn't have any aunts and uncles.</sentence><sentence id="219">No grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="220">There was never a grandmother to -- to -- to hug them and kiss them or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="221"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> functions, for parent and grandparents, there were never any grandparents around.</sentence><sentence id="222">We used to adopt grandparents for them.</sentence><sentence id="223">In</sentence><sentence id="225"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>, RG-50.549.02*0007 9 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> we use to a-adopt a lady in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">She was nice, and th -- Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma.</sentence><sentence id="227">She did -- she had one daughter, an old, old maid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="228">So the kids were -- knew they -- and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="229">The only time the kids would -- our son was the first one, who was the oldest.</sentence><sentence id="230">When I joined this soccer team in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, which by the way was founded by German Jews who arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the 30's, just before Hitler got to them.</sentence><sentence id="231">And I joined this team and pretty soon -- there was a tryout -- pretty soon there were more survivors joining this team.</sentence><sentence id="232">So after soccer games we would go to someone's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, yours, mine or someone else's and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="233">We would start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, how -- how are we doing, how much money do you make.</sentence><sentence id="234">And before you knew it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> would come to the -- to -- into the -- into the conversation.</sentence><sentence id="235">And our children, especially our son, would always listen from be -- from behind the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">And --and he knew -- he -- then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something about Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha -- what happened to them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">So we didn't want to talk about these experiences to them.</sentence><sentence id="238">And ar -- then, let me tell you about the -- the -- the -- the local Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="239"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">metropolitan city</span> with a large Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="240">We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to learn English.</sentence><sentence id="241">I -- at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, and our soccer team will also meet there.</sentence><sentence id="242">So, I didn't go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I-- I---I-I</sentence><sentence id="244">ontectnstonancedjusietnoeg for tare biormatierabouttfisoetecion USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 10 felt [-- I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake.</sentence><sentence id="245">Would have listened to my wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="246">So we -- then we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our -- our own people in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">We had a Purim play, we went to a Purim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, no -- number of us in the soccer team.</sentence><sentence id="248">And the leader of the group says, that's enough about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">Let's go back to singing and playing the music again.</sentence><sentence id="250">So nobody want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="251">My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father's youngest sister, who lost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her nieces and nephews and -- and -- and -- and all her cousins, she wouldn't -- she, coming in 1939, emigrating to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1939 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, she didn't want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="252">So we decided not to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="253">The first time I was able to talk about it was when our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there.</sentence><sentence id="254">Yet, I didn't tell them a story like the story should be told.</sentence><sentence id="255">I kind of whitewashed it.</sentence><sentence id="256">I was afraid to hurt people.</sentence><sentence id="257">So that took a long time.</sentence><sentence id="258">So my children, at f-- at first they were resentful, they said Daddy, why didn't you tell us?</sentence><sentence id="259">Why -- you know, th -- they didn't come and -- and say to me, you -- you -- you were wrong, you -- you should have done it.</sentence><sentence id="260">But you could have told us.</sentence><sentence id="261">I didn't want to hurt you honey.</sentence><sentence id="262">This -- this is simple, it's a -- it the o -- it's the way it is, I'd -- it just -- I don't want to hurt strangers, let alone my own children.</sentence><sentence id="263">So they're different.</sentence><sentence id="264">But today they're very much involved.</sentence><sentence id="265">My daughter, the</sentence><sentence id="267">ontectnstonancedjusietnoeg for tare biormatierabouttfisoetecion USHMM Archives, RG-50.549.02*0007 11 oldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a chairman of [indecipherable] local -- local Holocaust Committee called Jewish Committee Relations.</sentence><sentence id="268">Both -- all three of the daughters went to second generation meetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="269">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ninete</span> -- January 27, 1985, I took two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the jeweler, with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for the commemoration of the 40" anniversary of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a liberation.</sentence><sentence id="270">And they came there.</sentence><sentence id="271">I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one, that was the first camp that I was taken to.</sentence><sentence id="272">I showed them the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that my father was last taken to, block seven in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, called the Krankenbau, the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273"><span class="INT_SPACE">Sick bay</span> without doctors.</sentence><sentence id="274">I showed them that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">This is where they took my -- your grandfather last time, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> from.</sentence><sentence id="276">I showed them <span class="BUILDING">block 16</span> where I s -- where I was living on the -- which by the way, <span class="BUILDING">block 16</span> today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian block</span>, a-a-and they have some artifacts in there.</sentence><sentence id="277">And we spend there a couple da

time I took agn -- took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter and the youngest daughter.</sentence><sentence id="279">This is where we made a film called, "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, If You Cried, You Died."</sentence><sentence id="280">So I sh -- there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show them what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is all about, what it was all about.</sentence><sentence id="281">I took them to every -- see I was working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews from every -- every Nazi occupied European country.</sentence><sentence id="282">And this is where</sentence><sentence id="284"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span>,
