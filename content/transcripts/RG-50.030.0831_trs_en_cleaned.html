<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BENNI KORZEN</span> September 18, 2015</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2">Q: I am Leslie Swift, speaking on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, on September 20", in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and I am speaking to Benni Korzen.</sentence><sentence id="3">And I would just like to start by asking what can you remember -- I know you were very young at the time that all of this happened.</sentence><sentence id="4">Can you tell me a little bit, if anything, that you remember from before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was five, five and a half when, as a result of a very chao -- chaotic and unplanned-for rescue operation, where people got together who had never been involved in saving anybody, decided to get together, save their Jewish neighbors.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="7">And so at -- at five and a half years, oh you know, I -- you're old enough to know what's going on, and I remember everything that I -- the highlights.</sentence><sentence id="8">But let me just go back and -- and also just explain that I was born in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, and from ninet -- from April -- <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, April of 1940, and for three years, a little more than three years, for reasons that anybody whose -- knows about history, the Germans pretty much left the population, including the Jewish population of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, sort of alone.</sentence><sentence id="9">One reason was that the German war machine, you know, took advantage of the fact that in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> there was a huge production of butter and bacon and all ho -- and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="10">So it made sense not to cause any trouble there.</sentence><sentence id="11">Then, something happened in August and September of Interview with Benni Korzen : September 18, 2015 deg43, as a result of which things changed.</sentence><sentence id="12">And essentially, orders came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to round up and arrest all -- and, you know, remove all of the dangerous Jews, and bring them down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">Anyway, the -- what -- what happened to me was, my parents, in those chaotic days, which were in October of 1943, not knowing exactly what would happen, they decided to place me with a non-Jewish family, a colleague of my father, they were both lawyers, and they fer -- they thought that would be the safer thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="14">And as it turned out, it -- you know, it -- it worked out.</sentence><sentence id="15">I was there, and I stayed there for six to seven weeks, and then one night somebody came and picked me up and took me acor -- you know, during the middle of the night, and I ended up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and was sailed across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, where my father had been nervously waiting for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="16">And we then ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and stayed there until May, 1945, when we then went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">There are some details that -- that -- along the way that I think are important to nat -- to -- to know.</sentence><sentence id="18">What happened between 19 -- April "40, and August, or so, 1943, was this relative calm.</sentence><sentence id="19">Then, the -- basically Eichmann decided, and the order came from his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to, you know, not -- no longer, you know, leave the Jews alone.</sentence><sentence id="20">What happened then factually, was that a low ranking -- I think he was a trade attache at the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, saw a telefax come in that wi-without any sp -- you know, that -- that gave him the information that there was a -- a Gestapo order now, to round up the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="21">He decided, without telling anybody, to tell a Danish friend, who -- whom he knew was -- wa-was, you know, a person who -- who would take that information.</sentence><sentence id="22">And that person took it to a high ranking politician, who went to the rabbi, and said, listen, this is about to happen.</sentence><sentence id="23">And the rabbi -- and the rabbi said, I don't believe that.</sentence><sentence id="24">And there -- th-the reason why he didn't believe that, was that the king, King Christian the tenth, had, from the time <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was occupied, given out many signals that all added up to, nobody touches anybody, because -- as long as I'm the king.</sentence><sentence id="25">And -- and he would sort of demonstrate his attitude by when he took his morning ride, horse ride, through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, whenever he was then saluted by German soldiers, he would simply turn his head away, ignoring them.</sentence><sentence id="26">And so, for three years -- three and a half years, everybody felt that with the king in charge, nothing bad would happen.</sentence><sentence id="27">And that led to the rabbi's reaction.</sentence><sentence id="28">However, wi -- faced with the very sh -- harsh information, he then -- the rabbi then changed his mind, and at a certain sermon -- evening in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, word came out and spread like -- like i-i-instantly.</sentence><sentence id="29">The Jewish population at that time was a little under 8,000, and 90 percent or so, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">So it was a very easy way to -- through -- not through anything, other than word of mouth, for everybody to be reached.</sentence><sentence id="31">And that's -- that's when this come -- sort of chaotic and spontaneous --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">well, it was spontaneous and -- but also, surrounded by chaos, because nobody had done anything of this nature before.</sentence><sentence id="33">That a rescue operation that then took ple -- the -- the major numbers of people who -- who were taken over, happened in October of 1943,</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: But you didn't go until November, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: I didn't go until November, and stayed with his family, where -- where -- because the family had two daughters my age, I sort of -- I-- I -- as I remember that time, 1-it was an exciting time, because th-th-they -- they treated me as I -- I suddenly became a member of a new family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: And -- and there was a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and so i-it was -- it was -- you know, I was kept away totally, from the reality of what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="42">So as -- continuing to speak about what you remember from that time, do you remember being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, or -- I mean, do y --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: No, I remember being then taken from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in -- it was November 17", and the reason I know that date is that a very nice friend, a journalist, a Danish journ- journalist, dug up information that has to do with when we then -- when all these Danish Jews arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, there was another sort of chaotic -- under the chaos of -- because nobody arrived in -- in -- at given points.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: The -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> that took us over ranged from long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> to, you know, large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing trawlers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">And they ended up wherever they could.</sentence><sentence id="49">And wherever that happened, the Swedish police took notes, and you know, took the information who -- who -- who had arrived.</sentence><sentence id="50">And so, I have a copy of that, dated November the 18", where I, as a five and a half year old boy, described as -- with, you know, not able to speak Swedish, which I then le -- later learned --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Yeah, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: --cause I went to first grade there.</sentence><sentence id="53">And what I remember is that the night when I was picked up by two very nice people that I had never seen before, one of whom gave me a comic strip, a ba-- a--a-- was a--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">comic book</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: A comic book.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Which I fo -- thought was fascinating.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: So that -- it's -- did -- he or she bought it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: So this [indecipherable] yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Oh, wow.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: A-A-And then we drove, and I think if-- this was not a fast thing.</sentence><sentence id="68">I think it took about 24 hours, because I remember I -- I was sleeping and then waking up, and then it was the next night.</sentence><sentence id="69">All the -- the -- the core things took place at night, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German patrol boats</span> covered the water between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, across which all of these both -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> sailed.</sentence><sentence id="70">So, it was probably something like 36 hours, and I do remember that when I was then placed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, a brusque voice from, I guess th-the guy in charge, said, kid, you puke on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and I throw you overboard.</sentence><sentence id="71">So you better behave.</sentence><sentence id="72">And it was said with some kind of a-- you know, a tinge of humor, so I didn't -- I didn't -- it didn't scare me, it was just, hey, I be -- okay, I better behave here.</sentence><sentence id="73">And th-the <span class="DLF">crossing</span> was fast, because this was a -- a very fast moving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">And at the other end, my fa -- of course, in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, my father then, who had come down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, where my parents had been settled, he had been waiting there for three days, not knowing -- it's not exactly like th-the schedule is this, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: So he was very happy, and -- and then we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and stayed there until May of 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: A-And so, wh-what -- what was your life like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: It -- it was, under the circumstances, I -- I -- I was then -- by the time I turned six, in the spring of "44, I was enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">local school</span>, first grade.</sentence><sentence id="85">And you know, that became a -- a new f -- lifestyle, that totally took me into a new world, and therefore, the war had sort of vanished completely from our lives -- from my life.</sentence><sentence id="86">Of course, in the case of my parents it was different, because my father was given the task as a -- as an attorney, to deal with settlements by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, the legal aspects of it.</sentence><sentence id="87">Bu-But, you know, that was not very much part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="88">I-- I was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: So, d-do you remember that your parents were anxious about anything, or it was just sort of like oh, this is our new life, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: No, they were anxious and nervous because --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: --they knew what -- what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="93">But it was not until sometime late April of 1945, that a new event totally took me by surprise.</sentence><sentence id="94">It was a night -- in the middle of the night, I hear voices that I never heard before.</sentence><sentence id="95">And I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we live, and there were -- this is like four a.m. My parents were set -- were seated, and my uncle and aunt were sitting right next to them.</sentence><sentence id="96">And what had happened was that in 1940 -- and during the October days, when everybody tried to get across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, they were captured, along with a group of -- of -- of people.</sentence><sentence id="97">They were -- they had been hiding in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near the <span class="DLF">coast</span>, where they were hoping to get off to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">And they were then taken down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">And they stayed there until April of 45, when they were rescued by, and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in those white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> that [indecipherable] had arranged.</sentence><sentence id="100">And so, at four a.m. I hear these voices, and I--I walk in there.</sentence><sentence id="101">Th-Th-The -- I knew them, but you know, at five before everything happened, we had visited them, so -- and I certainly recognized them.</sentence><sentence id="102">And they had survived without being able to function --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: To escape.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: -- at four a.m., and having a meal, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="105">And I -- and -- and I do remember that at some point, a-- a -- I'm just standing there, and nobody is even paying attention to me, and I see my -- my -- my mother says to my Uncle Ben, don't eat this, this is not fresh butter.</sentence><sentence id="106">I'Il -- Pll -- you know, I'll get you some fresh butter.</sentence><sentence id="107">To which he said, it's -- it's -- it's fresh enough for me.</sentence><sentence id="108">Now --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: -- what -- what we -- to -- to finish that story, what happened was that the war ended, and May fifth, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was freed, and -- and open again.</sentence><sentence id="111">And very shortly thereafter, we returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">And we found our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> pretty much exactly the way we had left it during those chaotic days, because a neighbor had taken care of it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: And can -- can you tell us more about that?</sentence><sentence id="115">I mean, do you know who that neighbor was?</sentence><sentence id="116">Do you remember that person from before the war, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="118">It was a next door neighbor, and -- but there were other people because I think the next door neighbor had -- there was a death in the family.</sentence><sentence id="119">An-Anyway, it -- it was a -- i-it -- it -- it was neighbors who took care of it.</sentence><sentence id="120">And I think that my parents were totally, you know, astounded that this -- and of course very happy, and -- and -- and so, in celebration, what they had brought back from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was a certain kind of chocolate that during the -- during the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, you know, you can't get chocolate, so what happened was there was a big party, where all the kids in -- in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> where we lived, were invited up, and it -- it was a sort of a -- it -- it was a party that took several days, that ended up -- that ended our <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> odyssey.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: And when did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, and how did that happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: That did not take place until 63.</sentence><sentence id="128">What happened was, before that, in ni -- in 1960, I star -- as a young, you know, 22 year old kid, I went to wor -- I--I started working f--at a <span class="BUILDING">movie company</span> aa -- as a-- you know, a P.A, a production assistant.</sentence><sentence id="129">One day, arrived a crew of five people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">CBS</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">They came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in order to do a documentary about the rescue of the Danish Jews.</sentence><sentence id="131">And so I was attached -- I--I spoke English, and I was attached to them as their sort of show -- their -- their guide.</sentence><sentence id="132">And what happened was, we went around</sentence></p><p><sentence id="133">and interviewed a number of the people who had been actively involved in the rescue operation.</sentence><sentence id="134">And a-at some point, we sat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsinore</span>, which is on the <span class="DLF">coast</span>, five miles across the water from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of a bookbinder, who -- whose last name is Kerr(ph).</sentence><sentence id="135">And he spoke not a word of English, so I not only had to, you know, translate, but also sort of try to interpret what he was saying.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">And that -- it was fine, it went on for 20 minutes, and the CBS writer got all the information he wanted, until suddenly Mr. Kerr(ph) turned to me and said in Danish, listen, I'm -- I'm -- I'm busy, I'm a busy guy.</sentence><sentence id="137">Get these damn Americans out, I've had enough of them.</sentence><sentence id="138">Which was a -- which made it slightly tricky for me to translate, and I didn't quite know how to handle that.</sentence><sentence id="139">But I wa -- I was sort of saved by the bell, because in walk -- into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> walked another man and -- and -- who was clearly a -- his, you know, assistant, or friend, whatever, because he was then introduced to all of us.</sentence><sentence id="140">And when it came to me, and -- and he heard my last name, he said, wait a minute, I -- I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="141">Then it turned out that wha -- what unfolded was sort of a-- a -- wa-was as follows: it turned out that this man who came in, whose last name was Larsen(ph), had been the assistant of Kerr(ph) during the transportations, and what then ev -- developed was that it was on Kerr's(ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that I had been taken across.</sentence><sentence id="142">And he was the one who said, if you puke, you go overboard.</sentence><sentence id="143">And so, all of this happened within two minutes.</sentence><sentence id="144">And h-- and of course, Kerr(ph) changed his attitude, and we stayed and had beer and [indecipherable] and -- and lunch, and stayed for hours.</sentence><sentence id="145">And then the next day, that story was then made part of the -- of -- of the documentary.</sentence><sentence id="146">And again, I was, because Kerr(ph) still didn't speak a word of English, I had to sort of tran -- translate everything he said.</sentence><sentence id="147">He then -- his story, as part of -- of -- of the people rescuing, you know, their Danish neighbors, Danish Jewish neighbors, was that he continued sailing across, even into 1943 - "44, the spring, in spite of the fact that it got increasingly difficult, because there were more and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrols boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">And so it was only on nights without any moon that -- that he could cross without being seen.</sentence><sentence id="149">And what did help his -- his enterprise was that he went -- he was sort of a--a Scarlet Pimpernel of -- you know, he -- he didn't pay much attention to his own safety.</sentence><sentence id="150">He -- he -- he went from a very small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, to a f -- pa -- bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and by the time, in November of "43, he had a -- as, under the circumstance, a very fast <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">And so, he managed to do this until he was caught and almost killed in 1944, and he spent a year in -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">He also, obviously, survived, because we had this wonderful lunch and thing in -- in -- in [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: And -- and -- and so, did -- did you talk at all about why he was motivated to do what he did?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Yes, we did, and his style was -- he said -- and I translated verbatim, and it ended up in the film, he said, I didn't rescue the Jews, or anybody, because I liked them.</sentence><sentence id="156">I did it because I hated the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="157">That was -- I mean, that -- that -- that was what he said.</sentence><sentence id="158">Obviously, there was more to it, but that was what came out of his mouth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Or he hated fascism, or he hated, you know --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: -- the government, or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's very interesting, and -- so, one question I had, just when reading your story was, when this documentary was made, was it because the Eichmann trial was going on, or was there any relationship to that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: No, I-- I - that may have been part of -- of the thing, but I think more to the point was that the producer of the CBS documentary, you know, had a personal interest.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="172">He thought this was a very important story to show his viewers, and it -- it became -- it was part of what was then the Sunday morning -- CBS had Sunday morning -- this before cable and anything.</sentence><sentence id="173">And so the public affairs-type service that was given mostly by CBS -- and NBC, and AB -- ABC and NBC did not do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="174">So they had a whole department of -- of people on fi-- on 11", and <span class="DLF">57" Street</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">production office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And -- and they did whatever they thought was important.</sentence><sentence id="176">And so, they told this story because they wanted th-the American -- the American viewers to see it.</sentence><sentence id="177">And it was broadcast twice, because it did make -- it was the first time a--a TV program had done this.</sentence><sentence id="178">Books had been written that -- before, and many ca-came afterwards, dealing with the same subject, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: And do you -- do you know any other people who were rescued?</sentence><sentence id="180">I mean, is there any kind of community that you maintain because of, sort of that shared experience, or you're just an American now, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: A few, but bi-- because I have a very large family; my father is one of seven, my mother one of four, it was mo -- it was more [phone ringing] I'm sorry about this -- it was more --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Oh, that's okay.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="186">Q: -- and why and when, and how that whole thing -- how it -- how it all happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Well, then, because of the contact that I made with the people at -- at CBS, which lasted after they went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, they worked on the program, and then I got a call, would I -- would I like to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, because I could help sort of put it together, and then I -- I stayed.</sentence><sentence id="189">I--I went back a couple times, but I ended up liking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I thought it was very exciting, and I -- they gave me a job, sort of being a production manager for a number of programs Interview with Benni Korzen 6 September 18, 2015 that came out of the same <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">The -- the public affairs Sunday morning programs.</sentence><sentence id="191">There were two shows, "Lamp Unto My Feet," and -- and "Look up and Live."</sentence><sentence id="192">Those were the two programs.</sentence><sentence id="193">And this precedes you know, cable, and -- and there -- everything else.</sentence><sentence id="194">So, th -- I-- I got stuck here, and I met a young lady in 1964, and got married three -- two and a half months after we met, and that is now 51 years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: And now you're in <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: And now -- then we mo-moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> in 1990, because we made a movie there, and it was easier to -- to sti -- to then stay, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: So what -- I mean, just -- just to go back to what you remember from the time, what sticks with you?</sentence><sentence id="207">What is -- I guess what -- what do you really sort of have clear memories of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: [have a very clear memory of spending something like an hour on a fast moving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, because what also happened was in October -- in November of 1943, pretty much all the Jews had been crossed -- ha-had crossed to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and so those -- th- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> then took care of -- had people such as -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> it wa -- it was a-- an RAF pilot who had parachuted over <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, and he had to get -- be gotten out.</sentence><sentence id="211">The Royal Air Force, you know, the British air force.</sentence><sentence id="212">And there were some other people.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, later on, while I was still six or seven, and we talked about th-the -- the crossing, I -- I wi-- my father said something, and I said, well, it was me and the other saboteurs that -- that crossed th-the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">I -- and because it was sort of a--a very -- it was the first time I'd bid -- bid -- been on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> of that type.</sentence><sentence id="215">It may have been the first time I'd e-e -- been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, ever.</sentence><sentence id="216">You know, as a five year -- and a half year old boy, I was very excited about how it worked, and -- and since, at that time, unlike before, during the really chaotic days in -- in -- in October, where s- sometimes young children were a -- you know, given sleeping pills, or whatever, to make sure that they would not make noise, this was different.</sentence><sentence id="217">And I guess th-the -- Mr. Kerr(ph) took a chance.</sentence><sentence id="218">I guess he talked to me, and the way I responded made him believe that it was not necessary to -- to, you know, give me an injection to -- for -- for me to keep quiet.</sentence><sentence id="219">So, by the time we arrived in -- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helsingborg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, which is across from the shortest distance from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, I've -- as we moved into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span>, along the -- the side, I-- I saw my father from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and he was there with -- I think with a policeman, nervously pacing back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="220">So that's what I do remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: And -- and do you remember getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and then seeing your father and being reunited, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Well, th-the mi -- the image I remember is, as we moved into -- towards, you know, like maybe 25 yards before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> actually moored.</sentence><sentence id="235">And then what Interview with Benni Korzen 6 September 18, 2015 happened, I don't remember, but obviously what -- what did happen was that we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, my father and I, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, where we reunited with my mother.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="237">I-- I--1--TI just asked that question because I'm the mother of a couple of six year old boys, and I can't imagine, you know, being that person who was waiting for your child to arrive, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="239">And one reason why, during the interview where I discover -- where everybody discovered that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> had -- actually had me on board, what actually happened was that the man who walked in with a severe limp, because he'd been injured during the war, where his fellow -- Mr. Kerr(ph) was almost killed, when he was introduced to me, and remember the last name, which is somewhat unusual, there -- the -- the reason why he remembered that was that my father had, as a gift, made -- given him a silver cigarette -- he was a smoker -- and had engraved in it, a thank you note from him, last name being Korzen.</sentence><sentence id="240">So, the name had sort of se -- was a name that this guy --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Remembered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: --remembered very clearly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: So -- I don't know how to end the interview.</sentence><sentence id="246">Any -- i-is there anything else you would like to say, to tell us today?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Well, the --</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: I mean, what does your experience -- how does that inform your day to day life today?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: What happened then, where basically people put themselves at -- at risk, and -- and many died, is an example that sort of stands as a, you know, role model for human behavior.</sentence><sentence id="253">Now, what we're witnessing these days, having to do with refugees, and -- and immigration, and people trying to escape alive from either war, or related horrible -- horrible to human situation, i-i-is -- is the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="254">And it would be very nice if this example, which is not really that known, could be, let's say, elevated a-as the role model to -- for everybody to -- to -- to imitate.</sentence><sentence id="255">How that is to be done, remains to be seen.</sentence><sentence id="256">Obviously, it -- it would take -- it would take a -- an attitude that is the total opposite of what's happening right now.</sentence><sentence id="257">This is 19 -- this is 2015, where, as we witness the debate about who we are, and what we should do, and what we should allow, the -- the -- the -- as I see it, the idiocy of doing the opposite of what this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is all based on.</sentence><sentence id="258">This <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is based on having people come here, and then start a life that ends up making a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as good as it can be, because of the people.</sentence><sentence id="259">So there -- so therefore the -- whenever the opposite is being advocated, that to me sounds like it's based on idiocy, it's based on ignorance, and anything we can do to counteract that, w-we -- we all have, I think, a responsibility to do.</sentence><sentence id="260">Interview with Benni Korzen 0 September 18, 2015</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="262">Okay, can we cut for a minute, and let's -- [break] Can you tell mea little bit about what you remember from life before the Holocaust, you know, did -- was your family religious?</sentence><sentence id="263">Did -- did you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, that kind of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: The answer is no.</sentence><sentence id="265">The previous germ -- our gran -- my grandparents, were somewhat religious.</sentence><sentence id="266">They did not -- they did celebrate the -- the -- the high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="267">I was Bar Mitzvahed when -- 13, as the -- as the last of my sibling, and so we were, and still are, what you would call secular Jews.</sentence><sentence id="268">When our son turned 13, and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time, we did not -- what we did was, we sent him to be tutored by a Yiddish poet, who tutored kids, and dealt with everything Jewish, except for religion: history, music, culture, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="269">And so, he got his -- his upbringing in the same secular tradition.</sentence><sentence id="270">When my wife and I got -- when I got married, which was in 1964, we went down to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in -- in-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, but we really didn't like the <span class="INT_SPACE">AstroTurf floor</span>, and -- and couldn't see ourselves, sort of, doing the -- the ceremony there.</sentence><sentence id="271">So we ended up, we lived on the Upper West Side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, and we ended up finding a rabbi in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, who was willing to marry us with the understanding that we were secular Jews.</sentence><sentence id="272">And so he -- he promised to stay away from subject that had to do with -- that would not really connect with being a secular Jew.</sentence><sentence id="273">And i-- and the only thing he -- a-and -- and he said, so let's do it in my <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span>, you know, not in the -- in the big <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, where Interview with Benni Korzen * September 18, 2015 actually, I think the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> seats about 3,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="274">So, we came there with eight friends, and he changed his mind, he said no, let's go into the big <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, even though we are only 12 people.</sentence><sentence id="275">And so, you know, be-be-because he wanted to demonstrate that he could deliver a -- a sermon for people like us, and -- and he -- and I -- I've -- he did.</sentence><sentence id="276">So, he managed to stay away from, you know, the word God.</sentence><sentence id="277">And yet, he -- he did not violate his own, let's say background and principles of being a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="278">He -- he knew how to do -- to -- to have that -- that balance.</sentence><sentence id="279">So my -- the fact that I was -- went through a Bar Mitzvah, I -- I -- I'm -- I'm happy and proud of it, even though the truth is that very shortly thereafter, I lost the ability to s -- to speak whatever Hebrew I had learned.</sentence><sentence id="280">Which is what you need to understand, and -- an-and you know, it's like, it just ended up in -- in -- in retrospect it's -- it was a nice experience, it was a nice thing that happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: But it has not influenced our lives, going forward.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="303">And do you ha -- do you feel a commonality with other Holocaust survivors, or do you feel, you know, that your experience was -- because there -- one thing we learn in this, you know, at the hol -- at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, is that there are so many different experiences.</sentence><sentence id="304">It is, you know, people say Holocaust survivor, but it is a very diverse sort of set of circumstances.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: It's a very diverse -- yes.</sentence><sentence id="312">One thing that happened very early on, after I settle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was my wife and I, we met a--a young girl our age, and for reasons that neither of us understood, we sort of -- we became fast friends, and still are.</sentence><sentence id="313">This is now 50 years later.</sentence><sentence id="314">She happened to be -- she's my age, and she was a -- she is a survivor, but under much more dramatic osten -- circumstances, in that she was saved by her grandmother, who was with her.</sentence><sentence id="315">And this was -- she -- she was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and under circumstances that cannot be described any other than miraculous, survived, and ended up in sw -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">And by the time we met her in 1964 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, she had, like I, sort of gravitated from wherever, but -- and had no longer -- the fact that she was a German Jewish girl, had totally changed into, she was now a New Yorker.</sentence><sentence id="317">But -- but her story, and her attitude, and her whole demeanor, clearly was something that, you know, it made an impression, and you know, th-the bond that -- it's not that my story has much to do with hers, because mine is a happy end, and hers is a bittersweet, with a happy end.</sentence><sentence id="318">So, it is a very big difference.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: Mm-hm, yes.</sentence><sentence id="328">So I would like to thank you for coming, and doing this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: And I -- I think -- am I missing anything?</sentence><sentence id="334">I said that already, but -- so, can you tell me anything you remember about right before, and you know, were -- what -- was there anti-Semitism, do you remember feeling that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: No, growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, as -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span> as I did, the -- the -- the -- the -- the life that began after I came back in 1945, had -- there was n-no anti-Semitism, or any other, let's say negative aspect of -- of life.</sentence><sentence id="336"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was then a society that had very few prejudices.</sentence><sentence id="337">The Danish -- the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>, that had been there for a few hundred years, because in 16-something, the king of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had invited a -- a bunch of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or wherever, in sort of <span class="REGION">middle Europe</span>, to settle, because he was an -- an enterprising builder-type king, and he'd heard that having Jews around would be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="338">And so, from that moment on, the Jewish community grew, and by the time we get to World War II, there were, in Danish culture, a huge impact of the Jewish artists and playwrights, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="339">One play that is always part of the repertory of the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Theater</span> in Copenhagen, is written by a Jew, and -- and deals with a Jewish holiday, and the reason for that.</sentence><sentence id="340">So, the au -- so th-the -- when I -- un-until I left in 1964 and settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the -- th-the -- being Jewish in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was almost something that people would boast of, or having a Jewish grandmother, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="341">Things have changed because there have been at -- b-both because of politics, and so on, a-and because of Europe now is -- is a different continent than it was then.</sentence><sentence id="342">So th-th-the wonderful -- let's say the -- the days of peace and prosperity and cultural exuberance that I re-relate to, when I was very young, that has changed, unfortunately, in the negative direction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="352">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="353">And, do you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Yes, we go -- we go quite often, at least once every two years.</sentence><sentence id="358">My very large family loves coming here.</sentence><sentence id="359">And so, we s -- th-they come here more often than we go there.</sentence><sentence id="360">But, you know, we are -- you know, with everything, such as Skype and so on, we -- we -- we -- we stay in very close contact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="366">Well, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="367">I think we will end there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: And I guess we need to sort of break everything down, but you don't need to be involved in that. [</sentence><sentence id="374">break] Thank you very much, Benni, for being with us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Well, you're welcome, as a -- but Leslie, you know, if -- if you -- if you discover that you need something more, I can phone it in, as we say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
