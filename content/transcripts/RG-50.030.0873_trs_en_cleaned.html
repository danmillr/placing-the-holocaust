<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: There's a whole big <span class="REGION">area</span> in there, but that -- that's where her father came from.</sentence><sentence id="101">And the thing that's very confusing, if you look at the -- the family tree, or anything else, is that my grandmother, whose maiden name -- well, my mother's maiden name was Lowenthal(ph) -- Lewenthal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Mm-hm, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lowenthal</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: And her mother -- her father was Hermann(ph) Lowenthal, and her mother was also a Lowenthal, but they were not related.</sentence><sentence id="107">And so that gets very confusing --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: --when you look at the -- at the family <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, because you don't know which ler -- Lowenthal you're talking about.</sentence><sentence id="110">But they had nothing in common.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Did you do that?</sentence><sentence id="114">Did you research your family tree, at some point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="118">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: And ki -- how fa -- ka -- what can you tell us about that, what you discovered?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="123">How far back did your family go in-- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="124">How -- how far back could you discover?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Well, my father's family, the Hockenheimers, I've been working on all week, to make it into some form that I can give you a copy.</sentence><sentence id="126">My father's family I traced back to about 1789, and my mother's family, I would say the 1850s.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="130">So that's how far back you were able to find, and they were all still in these <span class="REGION">areas</span> for several generations.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: Yeah, what happened, the one thing that you notice when you do that, is that in the 19 -- I'm sorry, in the 1890s, the Jewish people moved from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">So that was a big change there.</sentence><sentence id="134">They all were born in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, but they all wound up in big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">And that had to do with the government attitude, and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="140">They -- there are a lot of little things you find out, you -- for example, until the 1850 -- 60s, children had Jewish first names.</sentence><sentence id="141">Starting about "70 -- 1870, they all had very German names.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: My father's brothers were Albert, Louie.</sentence><sentence id="147">The youngest one was Fritz, heaven forbid, and my father was Julius --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: -- and they all had the German names.</sentence><sentence id="150">The German Jews, it's a big thing that comes out of this, wanted to be Germans.</sentence><sentence id="151">A lot of them were very religious, some of them weren't, but they all wanted to be accepted, which was a -- the key to this whole thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: They wanted -- they finally wanted to be accepted.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: And so, were you able to find -- if you -- there was Fritz and Ira and Julius, what about their father, what was his name?</sentence><sentence id="160">Did you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Well, yes.</sentence><sentence id="163">My father's father's name -- he was born in 1844 i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hockenheim</span>, his name was Maier, m-a-i-e-r. There are two versions.</sentence><sentence id="164">It could be m-e-y-e-r, but he-he was m-a-i-e-r, and his father was Isaac, with two As.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Well, you know that's very -- that's interesting, because in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, you would still find people of your father's generation with Jewish names, rather than let's say, with a Polish version, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a Hungarian version.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167">They would still be those old names, which sol -- which kind of suggests the assimilation hadn't happened.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Yeah, it wi-- yeah, the -- unfortunately, I have to say that the German Jews felt very uppity about east European Jews, and the -- and I don't -- the older I get, the less I understand it, because I find out in looking at the family tree, that, for example -- well, that f-- the one thing that complicates everything is that because of all the wars over there, the -- they -- the people changed citizenship any time.</sentence><sentence id="169">I mean, they didn't know who was running what part of the [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="170">On my -- on my wife's -- my late wife's family, her name was Frankel, and her paternal family, ther -- her father was born in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.35" long="23.5">Drohobych</span>, in -- in --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Oh yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, isn't it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Well, depends when you're talking about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: That's true, that's true.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: When he was born, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">In, I think from 1871, after the Franco- Prussian war, it became part of the -- of the Austrian-Hungarian empire.</sentence><sentence id="178">Because not her father, but her uncles all served in the Austrian army in World War I. And then, after World War I, it became -- let's see, after World War I, I guess it was Polish, and after World War II, I think now it's Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="179">So, I can show you a document that I have, and they -- the -- the brothers of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Mm-hm, of your late wife.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Of her father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: The fa -- his generation, born 1885, he -- her father was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: His brothers, who were -- their oldest one was born in -- in "73, 1873, they all served in the Austro-Hungarian army.</sentence><sentence id="191">I have pictures of them in Austrian-Hungarian uniform.</sentence><sentence id="192">And one of them, her father, I believe, when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he -- they -- they all had a business together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they ha -- Frankel is a pretty German name.</sentence><sentence id="193">And so he's -- his -- his fr -- his first name when he was born was Moses, and he changed it, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he changed it to Moritz(ph).</sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">So in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he was called Moritz(ph).</sentence><sentence id="195">And in 19 na -- 1920 -- and I don't quite understand it, but I'd have to study a lot of history to figure it out, but in 1920 he -- he wanted to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solingen</span>, which is in what we now call North Rhine-Westphalia --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: That's right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: --on a business trip.</sentence><sentence id="198">And he had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Chamber of Commerce</span>, for the <span class="BUILDING">Chamber of Commerce</span> to support -- to support the request.</sentence><sentence id="199">And so, they supported the request.</sentence><sentence id="200">And -- but on the -- on the application, or on this paper, there's a statement, says, what's your nationality?</sentence><sentence id="201">And -- 1920, and -- and he answered Polish.</sentence><sentence id="202">And -- and printed on the form it said, and what was it before 1919?</sentence><sentence id="203">Because World War I stopped in "18, what was -- an -- an-and then before -- so, a year before, his nationality was Austro-Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="204">So, you know, just trying to figure out what you were, wasn't exactly easy in those days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Could be confusing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: It could be very confusing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Very confusing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: But they all -- they -- they then, you know, they all had then German first names, from about that period on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Now, did you discover these things about your family through your own research, or were your parents storytellers, who told you about their lives, their childhoods, what -- what -- who their parents were, who their grandparents were?</sentence><sentence id="222">How did you discover what you ha -- what you now know?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Well, I guess there are two answers to that, as a child.</sentence><sentence id="225">I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until I was eight years old, and as children we -- we went to see the grandparents on my mother's side.</sentence><sentence id="226">My father -- my father was the youngest of 10.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4247">A: Well, the first thing is the colonel -- the colonel that picked me up was the fellow in charge of intelligence for the Bremen port command.</sentence><sentence id="4248">So he was the G2 intelligence officer, and I was on his staff.</sentence><sentence id="4249">And the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence office</span> had to issue security passes, as much as you could check anybody.</sentence><sentence id="4250">We had a big <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> that was in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4251">The air force didn't bomb it, so we'd have a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="4252">I'm sure that's true, by the way, and -- because everything else was flat, except this wonderful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- it became our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4253">And so everybody that worked in that <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, because we needed German -- we couldn't do everything ourselves, we needed clerical staff, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4254">We, in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, we had no German clerks, because it was security.</sentence><sentence id="4255">But everybody else did.</sentence><sentence id="4256">And so our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was -- had the job of -- of getting them the passes.</sentence><sentence id="4257">Since I was the only person in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> who spoke German, it's -- I was the contact guy.</sentence><sentence id="4258">And they also -- they send me up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> for a couple weeks to -- to handle the <span class="BUILDING">security office</span> at the -- at the <span class="DLF">port</span> up there.</sentence><sentence id="4259">And I did that for, I would say until October, give or take.</sentence><sentence id="4260">And then, I had, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span>, I had the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> was a weird <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4261">When you finished your course --I was in the 24" class, if that's of any interest -- that up to the 24" class, when you graduated from Ritchie, you -- they either prom -- they promoted you to corporal, sergeant, or second lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="4262">And they promoted me to nothing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4263">Starting with the 24" class, no more promotions.</sentence><sentence id="4264">So, what they -- they took some people, and -- who wanted to be officers, and they sent them -- they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span>, <span class="REGION">Georgia</span>, on -- to take the quick course, the 90 day wonder -- I don't know if you ever heard that expression -- the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4265">Q: [have something similar, but I don't remember it -- the -- what it was called.</sentence><sentence id="4266">It's something --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4267">A: Yeah, 90 day wonder.</sentence><sentence id="4268">They -- they -- they take these guys, they send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span>, make them infantry officers in 90 days, which usually it took six months, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4269">And so you could go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ritchie</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benning</span> to become a 90 day wonder, and then come back as a second lieutenant, they had that, too.</sentence><sentence id="4270">With the 24" class, because of the -- how far the war had progressed, they didn't do that any more.</sentence><sentence id="4271">So I went in the war as a private.</sentence><sentence id="4272">But then, once I was over there, they -- they -- well, they promoted me to corporal, and I -- I had also applied at Ritchie to join the counter-intelligence corps, because that's what I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="4273">I wanted to catch Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="4274">That's what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="4275">But they told me I was too young, so I didn't get into the <span class="BUILDING">CIC</span>, you had to be older.</sentence><sentence id="4276">But then, once I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, and I applied again to get into the counter-intelligence corps, and they accepted me.</sentence><sentence id="4277">So, in the last six months I was over there, I became a special agent of the counter-intelligence corps, no insignia of rank, just two U.S.s, so that you could go to see some colonel, and chew him about what somebody in his outfit was doing, and without him knowing what your rank was, even though if you were 20 years old, they knew that you weren't a general.</sentence><sentence id="4278">So, I sa--I--I did that.</sentence><sentence id="4279">And it's actually as a result of that, that I -- ultimately when I was in <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span>, I got a commission military intelligence, because the gentleman that -- before I left, when my time wa -- came to 147 go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I was interviewed by a colonel from <span class="BUILDING">intelligence headquarters</span> in the States, asked me if I wouldn't stay as a warrant officer, or as an officer.</sentence><sentence id="4280">And I said no, I--I--I'd like to, but I-- I--I want to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, I got to finish <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, that's my first thing.</sentence><sentence id="4281">But when I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> in 48, I got a letter from the same colonel, he didn't know the c -- the con -- the connection, but he said, we're interested, if you would like to become a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve, and he gave me the conditions.</sentence><sentence id="4282">And you had to have been a staff sergeant, when I was a sergeant, which is one rank below the staff sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="4283">So I wrote him back and I say, well, colonel, I appreciate, but I'm only a sergeant, I'm not a staff sergeant, so I don't qualify.</sentence><sentence id="4284">But, if you are interested in knowing whether you think that I am qualified, if you're the same Colonel Stevens that came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and interviewed me in "46, and asked me to accept a commission, then you must know that I am qualified, otherwise you wouldn't have interviewed me.</sentence><sentence id="4285">And he send me the same paper back, handwritten on there, I'm the same guy, you" ll hear from me.</sentence><sentence id="4286">And about three or four weeks later, I got a handwritten note from him, and says, apply under army regulation so and so, so and so.</sentence><sentence id="4287">I did, and within six months I was a second lieutenant, military intelligence reserve.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4324">A: Well, they -- they had -- they had the allies put out a -- an order at the end of the war, they -- they had -- first of all, they had an automatic arrest category, that meant if a German, a Nazi was more than something in the Nazi movement, it required that if you found him, that you arrest him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4326">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
