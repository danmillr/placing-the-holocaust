<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">GUY STERN May 1, 1990 ...cause uh Linda, my family uh was, had, owned a uh small <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span>, uh sold textiles and uh my father was, of course, the main one who sold but my mother helped in the business and also brought up three kids.</sentence><sentence id="2">Uh I, I personally was brought up in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3">Went from there to a uh <span class="BUILDING">German Oberrealgymnasium</span> (ph) uh and then uh came my immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">Our family was active in Jewish affairs in the in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">My father belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Hillel lodge</span> and uh my mother uh likewise and we were active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">Uh but also took a very intensive interest in in Ger...in the German cultural life.</sentence><sentence id="7">My parents belonged to the uh uh theatre group, Freie Volksbuehne, which was a sort of uh a club that attended <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> once or twice a week, so uh that was the, were the premises under which I grew up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: Tell me about you as a child.</sentence><sentence id="17">Uh where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="18">Something about your friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: In fact I was recently back at the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> when when there was a commemoration of Kristallnacht and my uh and I was invited to give a uh dedicatory speech to the uh uh to to the uh of stone that was left there, an artistic re...re-creation at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the uh <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> had stood and they started a monument there, so I went back into that <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">It was a uh one pers...a one class school room, with where kids from the age of six to sixteen were all housed in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">school room</span> and the teacher there was a master of time engineering.</sentence><sentence id="24">He was able to keep the everybody occupied and differently uh except for choral singing or something like that during the entire <span class="BUILDING">school</span> day.</sentence><sentence id="25">I have, I've, I'm a teacher myself and I don't think I would have half the skills to do what he had done in giving us all a fantastically good education.</sentence><sentence id="26">Uh all the children who went on, later on to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, uh were uh prepared as virtually nobody else and excelled then in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">Uh my activities also centered around a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish club</span> which was called Jugendgemeinde.</sentence><sentence id="28">It was headed or instructed or conducted by our cantor, a man by the name of Sisnook (ph) and I've written about him and uh so that was the supplementary education.</sentence><sentence id="29">I think some of my skills if any as a uh as a an analyst of literature started there because we started sort of with ex...exegesis of the uh of , the and other and Mishna [ph] and the Talmud and explicated it and this this this uh tendency to read closely was really nurtured in that community.</sentence><sentence id="30">So that was, these are some perimeters under which I grew up and of course in in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with my uh Jewish as well as Christian friends, and it seemed before 1933 as if some level of integration had been reached.</sentence><sentence id="31">Christian friends came to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">I to, I to theirs.</sentence><sentence id="33">We were invited to the same parties together and of course it all came unstuck and viciously in 1933.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Tell us about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Uh in - I'll give, I think I can best illustrate it by one example.</sentence><sentence id="49">I had known one of my friends in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> even before I got to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, which starts, of course, started of course even as it does now in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at age ten, and uh uh his name was Heinrich, Heinrich Hennes, and uh he uh when the first nasty things happened in the <span class="DLF">school yard</span>, he be...he uh out of conviction became our stoutest defender.</sentence><sentence id="50">He would, he would, he would en...he would engage in fisticuffs in order to protect us.</sentence><sentence id="51">He was highly intelligent and then the, he was also of course in the Nazi youth organization as everybody in in the class was, and uh finally uh he was taken aside more and more by his youth leader and this youth leader and the propaganda managed to turn him around completely and he became our worst enemy.</sentence><sentence id="52">He became the attacker.</sentence><sentence id="53">He became, uh because he was so highly intelligent, he would uh he would shout very hurtful catcalls when one of the Jewish childr....uh we were three boys in this high sch...in this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class, and he would uh interrupt by catcalls.</sentence><sentence id="54">He became our worst tormenters.</sentence><sentence id="55">Uh he uh from the reports I have received later from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, he became such a fanatic that when the German fortunes turned around in in the Soviet in the Soviet Union, in the war there, uh he shot himself.</sentence><sentence id="56">And that is, I think while he is an extreme example this type of turnaround is, turnabout is is really very much significant and and characteristic of those times.</sentence><sentence id="57">There were few who either surreptitiously or openly kept contact with us, but we, we became as the years progressed ever more isolated.</sentence><sentence id="58">To uh, an incident which has no great significance but which uh just shows uh we were on soccer teams together and then all of a sudden you were not.</sentence><sentence id="59">You uh, I was kicked out of an <span class="BUILDING">athletic club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">Uh I uh I I was fairly decent athlete and I had won the requisite number of points to get some sort of medal and that of course was denied.</sentence><sentence id="61">These were small little incidents, but they linger because they're childhood memories.</sentence><sentence id="62">Of course they are compared to the horrors that followed, they pale but nonetheless these are memories, and that's also part of that process of growing up an adolescent in the Hitler in the Hitler years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Tell us more about that.</sentence><sentence id="79">Uh how did uh the tightening laws, for instance, affect your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Uh of course the Nuremburg laws uh immediately uh ma...we were forced to dismiss immediately the uh uh very nice young lady, young girl who had worked as as the household help of my mother and we had to take a woman uh I think over forty-five because that was a law that only uh women uh supposedly uh safe from the hyperactive Jewish male sexuality uh would be protected, and so she immediately left our <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">The tightening laws also meant that my father had fewer and fewer customers.</sentence><sentence id="84">Uh he had, he would uh travel uh during the week to various customers in the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and uh have samples of his uh textiles and then ship them out.</sentence><sentence id="85">And more and more and more often there were signs on these, uh on these <span class="DLF">farms</span> - we don't want Jews in here. "</sentence><sentence id="86">Juden ist der Eintritt verboten."</sentence><sentence id="87">Uh and so there was diminished income.</sentence><sentence id="88">There were worries.</sentence><sentence id="89">Uh and uh these were the first signs of a of a major catastrophe coming about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: How did things begin to change for you?</sentence><sentence id="99">When did you decide you knew you wanted to leave?</sentence><sentence id="100">Or were going to try to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: I think it was the uh atmosphere of hate and persecution and isolation in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, of being occasionally accosted when uh in <span class="BUILDING">public places</span>, you know - people would shout after you - this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about sixty-five thousand people, so people knew each other even if only slightly, so you were readily identified as a Jew and uh so uh my brother was beaten up at one time.</sentence><sentence id="105">Uh at another time uh there was a uh young man whom we knew from the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and when it was still open to Jews uh we would go swimming there, my brother and I, and uh uh one time uh a young fellow about our age uh started beating us up and if we had really resisted that would have made it worse, and uh as as as a sort of a psychological note, this man's, this young man's name was was Moses.</sentence><sentence id="106">He was not Jewish and I think uh his aggressiveness stemmed from the fact that at one time people thought this was a Jewish firm.</sentence><sentence id="107">They of course immediately changed their name from Moses to Mosel (ph) and uh uh I uh later on, getting back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> as a soldier, I found out that he was captured in in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and had a real sense of satisfaction about it. (</sentence><sentence id="108">laughter) But these were some of the incidents, the tightening uh at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - things we couldn't do anymore.</sentence><sentence id="109">You, there were many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you couldn't go on vacation any more.</sentence><sentence id="110">These were mild things, but being beaten up at the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span>, I I felt it was getting worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="111">My parents as well, and so they uh in in 1936 really was when they made serious efforts to contact our relatives in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> in order to try getting us out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: The relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, uh how had they gotten to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and when?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Very early.</sentence><sentence id="123">Uh my Uncle Beno (ph), uh my my mother's brother, uh was somewhat of a rebel as a boy and the, my my grandfather whom I loved was also the typical German patriarch, and any sign of rebelliousness was immediately uh was first uh there came stern warnings and when Uncle Beno became, still was not conforming to family rules, they shipped him to another relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was a place (laughter) for for uh disobedient sons and daughters and so he was shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="124">Yes. (</sentence><sentence id="125">Laughter)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: So the contact had been made...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: The contact had been made.</sentence><sentence id="133">It had really never uh there was the obligatory letter of say two letters a year and uh he had gotten to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, had uh learned how to be a baker, and uh until the Depression had a steady job at at one of the uh <span class="BUILDING">bread factories</span>, uh small uh <span class="BUILDING">neighborhood bakeries</span>, and uh then with the Depression he lost his job, and uh so he, however, had a good rapport with the union leaders so they sent him on various temporary jobs when somebody was sick or vacation or there was a special uh special demand for bakery goods, he was he was sent and so he would sometimes work three, four day...uh days and nights on end and then there would be uh absolutely no employment for for a month, but he he was able to get his family through the worst times, but he certainly was in no way financially able uh to back up an affidavit even though he made out one.</sentence><sentence id="134">And uh that uh came after I had gone on a bicycle trip with a Jewish group in 1937, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents told me uh two affidavits are waiting for you - one from my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and one by a children's organization also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, both of them in in fact worthless as far as the stipulations of the American government were concerned which wants to make sure by financial backing that the immigrant would not become a public charge.</sentence><sentence id="135">So uh the uh uh two affidavits were there.</sentence><sentence id="136">The children's affidavit worthless - I was fifteen at the time, hence I was not a child and my uncle had no financial backing whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="137">So, but I didn't know that these affidavits were really insignificant as far as the American government was concerned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: So what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: I (cough) I was uh able to secure a date from the American consul in very rapid order.</sentence><sentence id="147">Uh I had come back from this bicycle trip, I now remember, in about August, and had my uh and two months later had already a date in October with the American consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> which uh was, the distance was not very great and I was able to get a ride with a uh another family ready to immigrate and we all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">Uh the next day I presented myself at at the American consul's office.</sentence><sentence id="149">It was an encounter that lasted fifteen minutes and obviously changed my life.</sentence><sentence id="150">Uh the American official - I shall never forget his name because uh uh indeed it was the most important fifteen minute encounter of my life - his name was Malcolm C. Burk (ph) and uh he asked absolutely inane questions.</sentence><sentence id="151">Uh in he was it it was apparent that he wanted to have me succeed in getting getting his uh getting the visa and so he asked me questions like uh I guess to ascertain my sanity (laughter) how much is uh is uh 48 and 52.</sentence><sentence id="152">Uh I'm not good at numbers but that one I was up to.</sentence><sentence id="153">In fifteen minutes I had I had his stamp on on my uh identification papers and uh never really wondered...I I thought that was the way routinely matters went.</sentence><sentence id="154">And uh in November of that year I uh was uh informed by a Jewish organization that they had a group of children uh that was going over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and there was an escort, a woman...uh even right now under your questions, Linda, my memory is jogged--uh Mrs. Epstein (ph) and uh she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> going...taking us over and then coming back, having having fulfilled her mission.</sentence><sentence id="155">I uh disembarked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">Uh a far-flung relative picked me up, then turned me over to the Children's Committee the next day and uh they determined that my English was good enough uh that I could be sent on that long train trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and so I had arrived in in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Tell us what you did in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in those first years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="171">ITI guess I'll I'll put myself on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> once more, because there was an interruption.</sentence><sentence id="172">I had to change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, was picked up by a member of that committee and uh the this very nice woman said she could give me a short overview of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> uh in two hours until my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> was due.</sentence><sentence id="173">She took me in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the only thing that I remembered today of course is some of the <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> I had never seen before but also the absolute mad scene at <span class="BUILDING">Maxwell Market</span> where she took me and it's...I guess one of my first impressions of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> uh was was this <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and and uh the trading and and the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> [ph] all that went with it.</sentence><sentence id="174">Uh then I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, was picked up - my relatives, picked up by my relatives, taken uh to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and five days later I was in an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">Uh a very good one.</sentence><sentence id="176">It was considered at that time, Southern (ph) High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> was considered to be on a par with some of the <span class="BUILDING">eastern prep schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">Uh it uh I must say the education I had gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> both in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and and in a one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> uh <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was really geared me for what happened.</sentence><sentence id="178">I graduated within two years in June "39 and that is when I uh it was obvious that my uncle could not support me too.</sentence><sentence id="179">I started working in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">lunch room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">Uh then a teacher of uh a Jewish teacher took an interest in me, even though I had never taken a class with her, and she introduced me to the owner of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> chain - uh no, of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or the fanciest <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>, the Chase, and I became a bus boy there uh being trained first as a water boy and uh then in fact uh throughout my uh college career until I had my Master's I worked as a busboy and waiter in various <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, so that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="181">Uh in, I graduated in "39, worked for one year to have a bit of a financial backing and then started on a part-time basis at <span class="BUILDING">St. Louis University</span>, uh finished my uh my uh lower division courses by sort of uh the, I I got myself a job at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> closest to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, one block away - the Melbourne (ph) Hotel which in fact today is a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and uh sometimes ran from the one to the other uh coming to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> in my bus boy uniform and uh that's uh what I did.</sentence><sentence id="182">And then of course came the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: How did you keep in touch with your parents, or did you keep in touch with your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Yes, by letters of course.</sentence><sentence id="199">Uh and uh in fact the last one I got we were desperately trying to help, finding people to give an affidavit to uh a whole family.</sentence><sentence id="200">It uh there's there's something that II guess I still regret because uh I uh didn't have much money so I hitchhiked all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> going to movies that I wanted to see or to the uh <span class="DLF">Botanical Gardens</span> or various <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and one time I was picked up by a man.</sentence><sentence id="201">He said, I have money.</sentence><sentence id="202">I I can do this, and I, he he said but I must tell you, your the lawyers who will draw up this may uh uh may disdain my profession and not do this.</sentence><sentence id="203">I'm a gambler.</sentence><sentence id="204">And he was a wonderful man, and he said I'll go down with you to this lawyer and this lawyer, picked by the St. Louis Jewish community to help people like me uh was too short-sighted to see that all some consuls wanted was a piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="205">He said I cannot accept your affidavit.</sentence><sentence id="206">You are not in the kind of profession that the government will accept.</sentence><sentence id="207">It would have been, it would have been an easy thing to simply make out the papers.</sentence><sentence id="208">Had they failed, so be it, but he was he he was so conventional and so hide-bound that he refused this man's uh bona fide_ and it was this is one of the things that sometimes haunts me.</sentence><sentence id="209">Uh so I had my, the last letter I got from my parents was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">I don't know how it, whether that is customary or was still possible at the first uh at the in the first stages of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> to write communications from there, but at any rate a letter reached me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> in which of course it was a very guarded letter.</sentence><sentence id="211">I realized how bad things were but uh that was the last time I heard of them and uh, well while I have no absolute proof, the presumption is of course they died there.</sentence><sentence id="212">They were murdered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: .</sentence><sentence id="229">Tell me about you when the war broke out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Uh I tried enlisting and at that time they were not uh enli...uh they did not accept uh non- native Americans uh for uh for the Army or Navy.</sentence><sentence id="233">I was ultimately drafted in uh in "42.</sentence><sentence id="234">Uh at first was sent to a uh a medical administrative training camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Barkley</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">Had my basic there and then was plucked out one day by special orders to join the Military Intelligence training camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>, Maryland.</sentence><sentence id="236">Uh most of us were of course because of our linguistic skills, having had college background and the like and uh so I graduated from the eighth class of Military Intelligence Training Camp - it's not too far here from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">I visited it again, and uh then was, they put together teams for of interrogators.</sentence><sentence id="238">Uh after some uh additional training and uh being stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, we joined Ist U.S.Amny, then readying itself for the uh invasion, and their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bristol</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">Then uh on D-Day we of course were mar...uh we went to the Marshall (ph) area which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>, got on the LSD's and uh took part in the invasion.</sentence><sentence id="240">It was uh it was my first time, even though we had of course had mock interrogations back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh and trained, and be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...been trained in all sorts of things from German army organization to uh terrain intelligence - it was my first real interrogation with tough Nazis on the beaches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">And uh it was uh an experience that I've written about uh and I think what turned uh turned me uh into a uh removed all my sense of inferiority as an interrogator was that was my fourth or fifth interrogation when an artillery shell came over the uh <span class="BUILDING">interrogation tents</span> and uh we, both the prisoner and I, hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and uh he uh showed far greater fright than I did.</sentence><sentence id="242">And then everything went smoothly and I was able to extract interrogation from beginning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> to the end of until V-E Day and uh in fact uh I, my reports uh apparently were well-received.</sentence><sentence id="243">I I got the Bronze Star uh from General Hodges towards the end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Tell us about some of these interrogations.</sentence><sentence id="258">I know some of them have stuck in your mind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Uh II think uh most of our responsibility was of course extracting tactical and strategic in..information and uh some of it was very easy because the uh prisoners didn't realize that uh what they were giving away or we bluffed that we already knew uh or we uh tried to uh uh create the impression that a buddy already had told us.</sentence><sentence id="262">Uh that was, that was fairly easy.</sentence><sentence id="263">Some of them, some of the information uh was so uh obvious what we were after and so threatening to the prisoner that it, that we really had to use some very tough psychological warfa...uh uh what we had learned as psychological warfare and really put psychological pressures on the prisoners, and uh most of the time that worked.</sentence><sentence id="264">As uh as a rather neglected but uh <span class="DLF">byline</span> we told to ferret out war criminals and uh those uh guilty of uh genocide and and so forth and uh the first inklings we got of what really had happened were when we did extract such information from prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="265">Uh we would get a a soldier...a German soldiers, not high in rank, about our age and uh as you bored in your interrogation, he would admit that at one time he had been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard, particularly a guard in the early stages of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> set in.</sentence><sentence id="266">And uh uh they uh what what struck us at that time was the absolute inability to see the enormity of what they had done.</sentence><sentence id="267">Uh I remember one prisoner and in fact I took his confession, in fact have uh have it still, uh where he said uh that he had been a guard at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg concentration camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and that he had frequently volunteered for execution uh uh squads and I asked him, well why did you volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="268">He said well, if I hadn't done it they would have gotten somebody else, and one of the bonuses if you volunteered for an execution sq...squad was that you got a pass, an additional pass to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and you know, he said, uh very conversationally almost, you know, at that time they still had all the <span class="BUILDING">concert halls</span> open and I loved getting to these <span class="BUILDING">concert halls</span> and hearing the concerts there, and so I volunteered for the execution squads.</sentence><sentence id="269">He was particularly fond of Beethoven and Mozart.</sentence><sentence id="270">So these were the first uh interrogations were...it came about that we uh ferreted out some of the minor, small- fry criminals.</sentence><sentence id="271">The first uh really significant war criminal or let us say against humanity was a uh a man who who we uncovered in an absolute absurd way - it was not our skill but uh a combination of circumstances that brought about his unmasking.</sentence><sentence id="272">Uh my we uh I I have to give you a bit of background - that day, it was a, it was the day of Roosevelt's death and we were very upset and uh so uh uh one of the MP's brought in that day a prisoner, a young fellow, and uh he said this this fellow has a picture of Himmler autographed in his uh in his possession and so uh Freddie, my friend Fred Howard and I uh saw that picture.</sentence><sentence id="273">We were angry and so we took the picture away from the prisoner who said that he was a nephew of Heinrich Himmler and so we took the picture and uh we cut, cut, cut it out, the photograph and put a rope around his neck and hung it on a goose-neck lamp that was in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">interrogation camp</span>, hanging him in effigy.</sentence><sentence id="274">Later that day, very late at night, Freddie ushered in a routine prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="275">He was, had just been captured, a uh Dr. Schuebbe (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westphalia</span>, and uh this is, this man seemed disoriented.</sentence><sentence id="276">One of our prisoner trustees immediately caught on - he said drugs.</sentence><sentence id="277">And so uh uh this man was under the illusion, seeing the picture of Himmler and we were interrogating in short sleeves - it was, you know, very informal and we were not in uniform - and uh so he had the delusion that he was at a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>, with the picture of Himmler, of course, prominently displayed.</sentence><sentence id="278">And he said, oh, I'm glad to be here.</sentence><sentence id="279">I belong to you too.</sentence><sentence id="280">And so uh Freddie caught on uh this delusion and he said well, we know who we are - who the hell are you?</sentence><sentence id="281">And so uh he uh under the guise of try...of having him prove his credentials, drew everything out of him, including the fact that he had personally killed upward of twenty thousand people in in Po...in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">Uh you know, in the early stages of mass extermination, they used morphine injections, M Preparat, as he called it, and he had gotten addicted himself, so uh he was shipped out and that's how he landed in our uh in our prisoner of war enclosure, and he retold in precise medical detail - uh I even remember the words - uh how a prisoner died.</sentence><sentence id="283">You know, he said, oh well, we uh injected them with the uh "M" Preparation, morphine, and then he, after a while a certain euphoria was uh present, is, is a state of mind in the prisoner, then - and sort of said it exetentiously (ph) tallis, very medical, and we were uh uh, Freddie, I I uh was putting all this down and then uh he uh uh I I made a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="284">I came, uh it was late at night.</sentence><sentence id="285">I wanted a cup of coffee and Freddie had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="286">I came in and I was dressed in a Russian uniform.</sentence><sentence id="287">It was one of the tricks we used in order to extract uh information from the German prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="288">They uh, I was supposed to be a Russian liaison officer who would take recalcitrant prisoners uh and and ship them off to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">It was a very effective dig...disguise and uh very effective in putting psychological pressure on prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="290">I walked in and that startled him and uh Freddie, of course, caught the drift and immediately pretended throwing me out, that I was a uh a prisoner who was doing menial service and had just wandered in.</sentence><sentence id="291">That gave him pause and then he made a second mistake and that was the uh that he gave him coffee uh in this long interrogation and uh then uh he came out of the morphine, and he retracted everything.</sentence><sentence id="292">In the next couple of days we did really work hard to break him down.</sentence><sentence id="293">We took no-sleep tablets and it was just the routine type of interrogation that you sometimes see on police procedural detective stories - just hammering away again and again and again and by that time he was so exhausted as were we that he once more uh gave us the whole information.</sentence><sentence id="294">Uh the uh the in the first week of May issue of Time magazine carried the story and so did - we had in the meanwhile uh conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> as you'll recall, and <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span> became one of the powerful uh uh radio communication networks for the Allied forces and Radio Luxembourg broadcast verbatim - we took the uh interrogation down verbatim - uh broadcast that both in English and German, broadcast that all over for about two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="295">It was probably my biggest case and uh it was uh a pure accident, so you can imagine had it not been for all these circumstances working together, he would have slipped right by us.</sentence><sentence id="296">And probably be living a short uh living a long life in practicing medicine someplace in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rural town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westphalia</span> or elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="297">Uh he was executed by the Czechoslovakians later on.</sentence><sentence id="298">Uh he was turned over to them because he, many Czechs had been killed by him, so uh I could put that into medical terms but shan't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="338">Will you tell us about some of the other prisoners whom you captured?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Uh we we had one who was very high in the medical profession.</sentence><sentence id="342">You know, the uh people the doctors without humanity which was of the titles of the books about them.</sentence><sentence id="343">I told you about some of the minor war criminals.</sentence><sentence id="344">Uh the uh one of the cases that stick...sticks in my mind but is really less relevant for Holocaust except for possibly uh the uh stupidity and arrogance of some of our, of our officers, uh not our officers but of the uh...our officers, most of them were very excellent interrogators.</sentence><sentence id="345">Uh uh occasionally uh they were less adapt and they had to call in a certain enlisted man.</sentence><sentence id="346">Uh this was true of a case of Colonel Fundeheider (ph).</sentence><sentence id="347">He uh was a professor of law, had become a leader of parachute troops and during the Battle of the Bulge uh had been ordered to take a paratroop troop uh to fight against us.</sentence><sentence id="348">They were dropped at the wrong at the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> and quickly taken prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="349">Uh I uh I uh was ultimately selected to interrogate him, and for that you put on higher insignia in order to be on a par with your German prisoner, and uh so I interrogated Colonel Fundeheider and uh he had had part of his law education under a Rockefeller grant in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and he started telling me that and I paid no attention and then he said, of course I can't tell you nothing but my name and rank.</sentence><sentence id="350">I said, oh, I wouldn't expect a high-ranking officer like you to tell me anymore.</sentence><sentence id="351">Besides, you did such an inept, stupid, dumb uh uh uh dumb attack with your parachute troops, dropping them off at the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> - uh we really don't want to know anything about you.</sentence><sentence id="352">He he pulled himself up in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and started shouting at me.</sentence><sentence id="353">He said, how can you say that.</sentence><sentence id="354">That's wasn't my fault.</sentence><sentence id="355">That was the Air Force's fault, and I said, "Oh, we heard from your prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="356">You were you were completely out of it even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when you trained these troops," and in in defending himself, (laughter) how, what a great field commander he had been, he told me absolutely everything - how the troops were trained, what was their special mission, uh every detail.</sentence><sentence id="357">I egged him on - uh time after time, uh and I said well, maybe it wasn't quite so bad, but didn't you do this and then he would again explain this, and at the end of the interrogation, I said uh, Colonel, uh uh I uh really I 1 I honor your uh silence and uh I know you can't tell me anything and sent him off.(Laughter) It was one of the funniest uh interrogations I I had uh during the entire war uh and it was it's memorable.</sentence><sentence id="358">He ended up then as a law professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wuerzburg</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="359">I never looked him up of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Before we move on, do you have any other interrogations of people who were either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or who were comm...and/or who had committed war crimes that stick in your memory?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: Uh, no.</sentence><sentence id="383">They were uh, they were all this these kinds of small-fry, people who had been guards uh and who really uh I, in the...I can say in the aggregate, I uh that uh they were absolutely negligible as persons, but in the aggregate, they really had no conscience.</sentence><sentence id="384">They they realized, they had no idea really what they had done.</sentence><sentence id="385">Uh as a matter of fact, under your prodding, I do remember one case - he was a Romanian who had volunteered for the SS, or had been drafted.</sentence><sentence id="386">I can't recall that for sure, but uh under intense interrogation, he told us that he had sort of conducted a personal vendetta against a family in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, had showed up at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and simply shot them.</sentence><sentence id="387">Uh uh and so uh if if memories sort of come back and uh he uh said while I went into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Frankels (ph), I think that was their name, and uh simply, I I wanted some of the stuff in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> uh and he simply shot them right there on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="388">And that of course uh is a uh is a story that uh still remains.</sentence><sentence id="389">Uh it uh among those whom we liberated uh one of the more memorable scenes was uh and probably not very well known - uh the Germans had not, had put into <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> but not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> some of the veterans of the Spanish Republican Army, and these uh uh men uh whom Spanish officers we had liberated for the, they had been asked to dig defenses in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, but they had earlier been on the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span>, which the Germans had taken over and built fortifications there.</sentence><sentence id="390">So uh I uh since I had uh studied Spanish in in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, in - no, not in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> - I was asked to interrogate them, and so I uh they were of course not just uh re...uh reluctant witnesses but they were just so overly willing to give uh everything away and and tell what the fortifications were, and uh the one in fact was an engineer and drew me a very detailed and sophisticated map of all the fortifications on the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span> that he had helped build.</sentence><sentence id="391">And uh if we had ever invaded the <span class="REGION">Channel Islands</span>, we would have (laughter) had the most detailed situation map that you could have imagined.</sentence><sentence id="392">But of course that never materialized, but that was, is another memorable uh interrogation because of course the higher <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> saw it and uh that was the kind of detail that was very rare, even though it proved outwardly to be utterly useless.</sentence><sentence id="393">Uh but that is, those are some of the interrogations that I recall, except one of curious coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="394">This was at the uh right after the uh invasion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">We pushed forward into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we had virtually surrounded the uh German uh troops uh between the two cities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span> (ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Argentan</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="396">And uh there was one <span class="DLF">gap</span> - uh there's a new book, just came out - it's being reviewed and this book uh uh on World War II says the <span class="DLF">gap</span>, had Montgomery acted faster would have been closed and the war might have stopped right then and there or at least in the war in the west, and uh had we uh were unable to close it but we took 0 thousands of prisoners near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falaise</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Argentan</span> and so we had to do uh we had to do uh work very quickly with the prisoners and had no time except pick out some that by uh vir...by the testimony of their of their paybooks were important.</sentence><sentence id="397">So uh, I flipped through stacks upon stacks of paybooks uh which were in, were very detailed.</sentence><sentence id="398">The, not like our identification papers which gave virtually nothing away, but their's gave last leave, and I flipped through and I find a paybook, Gunther H., from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.147778" long="9.949366">Hildesheim</span>, a lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="399">And I thought this this can't be a coincidence...it can't be uh a strange...this must be the Gunther H. whom I went went to the same <span class="BUILDING">athletic club</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="400">So I waited till it was pitch dark that night, and interrogated him in darkness, of course using his home background uh to extract information and he was peering through the darkness because it was so obvious that I uh knew a heck of a lot about him, and at the end of it he said, uh how do you know so much about me, and I said well, I had also seen I was prepared for that question, that he had earned a high decoration and I said, well we in intelligence keep book on all those who are highly decorated uh officers in the German army, and then sent him out.</sentence><sentence id="401">It was uh this this kind of war coincidence--I've written about this because uh he might still be alive for all I know.</sentence><sentence id="402">It's exactly my age and uh a rather unprepossessing, uninteresting fellow when I was in the Turnverein--Athletic Club--Eintracht in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.147778" long="9.949366">Hildesheim</span> with him uh and he had developed into apparently a quite a warrior because uh that decoration wasn't given away uh to just anyone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="424">Q: Did he give you valuable information?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="426">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="427">I I have to be honest.</sentence><sentence id="428">It, since we had this, you know, uh surrounded Argentan and Falaise and I had not picked him for uh his potential as an informant but simply because I was interested whether it was the same fellow and uh just to see him again.</sentence><sentence id="429">Uh he he was, it was not productive, but it was a curious coincidence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="434">Q: Let's move on a bit...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="436">A: Surely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="438">Q: ...unless you have other stories of interrogations that you want to add.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: Uh, let's start moving across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and moving across Europe.</sentence><sentence id="443">Uh at what point did you start encountering your first prisoners of uh, that is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims and indeed your first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Uh, the uh guards were sort of strewn across our <span class="DLF">path</span> as we advanced into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and more and more of these uh small-fry prisoners who had been guards and who told us something of the horrors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">Then Schuebbe, that came right after we 1 crossed over uh across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Andernach</span> that we uh our prisoner of war camp was when we encountered <span class="BUILDING">Schuebbe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="449">Uh then at the end of the war uh when uh we had uh linked, uh almost linked with the Russians, uh were in that sector going through Hesse-we were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hersfeld</span> and then we came upon the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="450">It, uh we were not among the fir...the troops who came there the first day and I heard from some of them uh there uh utter horror and uh completely uh overwhelmed by by the sights.</sentence><sentence id="451">We came one day later and yet uh not much had changed because we could not, there was no way of evacuating uh the prisoners to a to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">We, of course, sent in physicians.</sentence><sentence id="453">We sent in food, clothing and the like and uh uh what uh the way these faces looked - I don't mean simply emaciated as you see, but some pie...one person whose jaw was hanging virtually loose.</sentence><sentence id="454">A tall man, emaciated with a loose-hanging jaw.</sentence><sentence id="455">I mean you you - these are details that stick in your head and in your mind and you uh you don't get over that very easily, and uh uh II talked to some of them and uh they uh it it was, you know, they embraced you uh and you you felt why do I, I'm not a liberator.</sentence><sentence id="456">You know, I I wasn't in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when it was liberated but there was this uh curious uh immediate heart-to-heart meeting.</sentence><sentence id="457">Uh and one of the...we were, the prisoners of war contingent was there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> but so was our uh MP outfit, a platoon of MP's that had served virtually from the very beginning, had accompanied all us all through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh and we had of course worked very closely with each other because when you uh interrogated you needed the safety of of the prisoners uh the the guards and you told them what you were doing and there was a real wonderful working relationship.</sentence><sentence id="458">The uh in charge of uh, nominally in charge was a captain, but the real disciplinarian of that MP company was a Master Sergeant Hadley from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steubenville</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="459">And uh uh I uh had, I was of the same rank for much of the time and uh so we had struck up a real friendship.</sentence><sentence id="460">I have, he was the prototype of the tough, read...and ready to fight U.S. Sergeant and an MP besides.</sentence><sentence id="461">You know, they have additional uh set of calluses all over their body.</sentence><sentence id="462">And uh uh Sergeant Hadley, I, we didn't arrive at the same time, and uh I was looking around - II I guess the uh emotions were so overwhelming that I looked for some sign uh maybe that's mental cowardice, that I was looking for some sign of something normal, so I looked for buddies uh who had come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us, and I saw one who had sort of cradled his eyes with his arm like this, and uh II recognized him immediately - it it was Sergeant Hadley, and he was bawling like a child.</sentence><sentence id="463">Uh it it was it was getting to all of us.</sentence><sentence id="464">And uh in in my case that was all the more understandable, because, you know, it was a very personal crusade, the war, and a very personal uh involvement with my parents and my brother and my sister over there, and uh | didn't know their fate at that time but I could surmise and but this, for generations we had talked about our uh heritage and the like, at one time this Sergeant Hadley and I, and he was for generations in in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and uh his family and but and he was not personally involved but he just uh uh broke down completely and I I was told by other members of uh who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> at various times that the same thing had happened to uh General Eisenhower when he came there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

it was the interrogation of my friend, he's still a friend of mine - these friendships have lasted from these uh compacted years of three years of interr...or two years of interrogation, uh the most intensive uh intense days of our lives really, cause we had a mission, and Carley (ph) had the most curious case.</sentence><sentence id="585">He wrote about it later on for commentary, but I know some of the details because I saw part of it, and that was the case of the Jewish SS girl.</sentence><sentence id="586">Uh and I uh I think it it's uh it's so again uh so convoluted that and the coincidences that this that this came to our attention and that we uh, that this girl got to that stage.</sentence><sentence id="587">She was a Belgian girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> and her parents, after the uh Germans had taken uh <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, managed to flee to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">Uh uh they got uh they got as far as the uh city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> (ph) and here the uh Catholic bishop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> uh took it upon himself to save some of the Jewish children, and what he did is he placed them with Catholic French families, cause they all spoke French being from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and he placed some of these Belgium children with uh uh with uh Catholic families and then uh the Germans of course came as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span> and they started first to deport Jews, and uh she still saw, by her testimony uh she saw her parents being rounded up on one of set of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that uh gathered in the uh in the uh city hall square of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montalbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">Uh then the Germans started recruiting French laborers to work in German armament industries and one day she, of course taken as a Catholic girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monalbon</span>, was also told to report for duty in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and was shipped to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LUNA-Werke</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, and she was, as she told us, she was so scared that she performed at with greater eagerness than even the, well certainly with greater eagerness than the other forced laborers who were of course also asked to work at top performance, and so 6 she came to the attention to uh one woman foreman.</sentence><sentence id="590">She said wow, this woman, she really puts her heart into it.</sentence><sentence id="591">We're going to make her an SS auxiliary.</sentence><sentence id="592">And she had, there was no way she could protest this, and uh so she uh, we found her together with another SS auxiliary woman.</sentence><sentence id="593">Uh we uh took her prisoner in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, in I beg your pardon, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, uh on the German, near the <span class="DLF">German border</span> and when she, when Carley was interrogating her, she said, uh I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="594">And he, he he, of course, you know, with with all the skepticism that we had heard all, every kind of story of exculpation and every kind of story of phoniness, you know - that was our job and uh and Carley said, you are what?</sentence><sentence id="595">Come on.</sentence><sentence id="596">Uh and uh then she explained what I have just told you, and Carley still didn't uh believe a word of it.</sentence><sentence id="597">He said it's a very clever uh clever way, and then he called over -
