<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Good afternoon, Flory.</sentence><sentence id="2">Can you please tell me your full name and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Flory Jagoda, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">You want to know when?</sentence><sentence id="7">I don't think I should tell you -- December 21st, 1923.</sentence><sentence id="8">A lot of years.</sentence><sentence id="9">Actually, most of the survivors are this age, maybe a little younger, a little older.</sentence><sentence id="10">But this is more or less around 70s and so.</sentence><sentence id="11">And they have one thing in common -- silence.</sentence><sentence id="12">They sort of don't like to talk.</sentence><sentence id="13">We don't like to -- it is almost like a wound that, you know, you heal.</sentence><sentence id="14">And you don't want to scratch it.</sentence><sentence id="15">It bleeds.</sentence><sentence id="16">And also, a lot of them do not want to burden their families, especially their children, with sadness.</sentence><sentence id="17">They want to forget.</sentence><sentence id="18">And it works for a while.</sentence><sentence id="19">You have children, and you have weddings, and grandchildren, and music lessons, and piano lessons.</sentence><sentence id="20">And I was teaching music myself for 25 years.</sentence><sentence id="21">So I was quite a busy lady.</sentence><sentence id="22">Then all of a sudden, children leave, and marry, and get a little older.</sentence><sentence id="23">And you know, you don't sleep.</sentence><sentence id="24">You sort of start dreaming, and seeing some images and faces of your family -- and, uh, you wake up in the morning disturbed and restless.</sentence><sentence id="25">And, uh, then you read these horrible stories -- there was no holocaust -- never happened -- and you know what that means to a survivor -- no holocaust?</sentence><sentence id="26">Your whole inner starts screaming.</sentence><sentence id="27">I think the age -- and I also think the story of the holocaust never happened -- is -- I think it broke the silence of a lot of holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="28">Age definitely had something to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="29">So here Iam.</sentence><sentence id="30">I'm going to take you to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>, and share with you my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="31">Actually, I'm not going to start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">We will go about 98 kilometers up northeast</sentence><sentence id="34"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bosnia</span>, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span>, very picturesque.</sentence><sentence id="35">It's know for its <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">My whole family lived there.</sentence><sentence id="37">Their name was Altarac, the Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="38">And they were very proud of their name.</sentence><sentence id="39">It meant , the high <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- very proud of that.</sentence><sentence id="40">And, you know, all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> that you read today unfortunately, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebenica</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rogatica</span> to, which is close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gorazde</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Travnik</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zvornik</span> -- all these little, tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> had -- besides Moslems and Serbs, they also had a Bosnian Sephardi Jewish communities.</sentence><sentence id="41">A lot of people don't know that -- Bosnian Jews -- Los Judeos Bosnia, they would say in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">And they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">Actually, they were descendants of the Spanish refugees that were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in 1492 -- the inquisition -- <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">The word <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sepharad</span> means <span class="REGION">Iberian peninsula</span> in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="45">Actually, they had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="46">I mean, they had to leave, or convert to Catholicism, or leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">They were given three months.</sentence><sentence id="48">A lot of them converted.</sentence><sentence id="49">A lot of them remained.</sentence><sentence id="50">They couldn't leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they really loved.</sentence><sentence id="51">My ancestors went towards <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">There sultan Bayazid II gave orders to -- throughout his Ottoman Empire -- to let the refugees in, give them freedom, to worship, to build <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, and, most of all, freedom to travel through his Ottoman Empire.</sentence><sentence id="53">So there were big communities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span> definitely became a thriving Sephardi community.</sentence><sentence id="54">They called it a Yirushaliam, the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, with their <span class="BUILDING">religious schools</span> and -- so, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>, looking for new opportunities, they went to these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that you read about today.</sentence><sentence id="57">Now the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- it was a very simple life.</sentence><sentence id="58">The family was very close nit, about 15 families, 15, 16, families -- most of them, Altarac families.</sentence><sentence id="59">And in my family, definitely, the leader was my nona (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="60">my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="61">My nona was a kind of a grandmother that a child dreams of having, not because only -- I mean, her voice was something that was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="62">She sang beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="63">But she was a midwife, a well known midwife, in all the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, she knew herbs.</sentence><sentence id="64">Her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always full of women with babies and children -- "What do I give to this one?" -- "</sentence><sentence id="65">What do I" -- "What herb do I use?".</sentence><sentence id="66">She was the one to put the first pair of earrings through the babies" ears.</sentence><sentence id="67">And naturally, she was the leader of her own band, as we say in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- leader of the band.</sentence><sentence id="68">She had her own singing family, which was well known as the Altarac family, the singing Altarac family, five daughters and three sons.</sentence><sentence id="69">She was the teacher of religion in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">Women did not go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as much as we see here.</sentence><sentence id="71">The men usually went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, took their sons, taught them Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="72">And the woman stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and she taught her daughters and granddaughters tradition, religion, heritage.</sentence><sentence id="73">All that she learned from her nona, and her bis- nona, the great grandmother, just went on from generation to generation.</sentence><sentence id="74">They lived there for about four centuries, and the old peacefully died, and the young were born and married, and there was harmony in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- the Moslems and Serbs and Jews lived in harmony there.</sentence><sentence id="75">I never remember hate or quarrels.</sentence><sentence id="76">The women visited and the children went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="77">I would never, never, never, believe that the madness of the Second World War would bring something.</sentence><sentence id="80">So, uh, the life didn't have too much change.</sentence><sentence id="81">And more or less, everybody was quite satisfied, went along with the life as it was.</sentence><sentence id="82">But my nona's family -- there was one daughter -- she just couldn't take it -- that was my mother, Rosa (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="83">And she was actually considered as a rebel.</sentence><sentence id="84">I mean, she always dreamt of far-away <span class="NPIP">places</span>, she read books that she was not supposed to read.</sentence><sentence id="85">If there was something in the family -- or the girls wanted to try something new, let Rosa do it first -- to eat something -- let Rosa taste it first.</sentence><sentence id="86">She was just very, very different.</sentence><sentence id="87">So finally, she talked her family to send her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>, which was a thriving -- I mean, big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at that time, huh?</sentence><sentence id="88">And she went to stay with my tia esperansa (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="89">Tia is aunt.</sentence><sentence id="90">And I will be adding some of these Ladino words, because they just fit in with the words that I'm saying.</sentence><sentence id="91">It's, as we call it, Lingua De la Madri (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="92">the language of the mother.</sentence><sentence id="93">This was the language in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">You passed the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and you did not hear Serb or Croatian words.</sentence><sentence id="95">It was only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>, as we call it, Judeo-Spanish.</sentence><sentence id="96">Sometimes, we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- with non-Jewish friends -- and I would sort of be a little embarrassed, I would say nona-- can't you speak so -- they'll think maybe we're talking something, you know, behind their back.</sentence><sentence id="97">She would look at me very seriously.</sentence><sentence id="98">She'd say .</sentence><sentence id="99">And she'd say, "You know, you are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="100">You have to speak Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="101">This is her Jewish language.</sentence><sentence id="102">She considered that as her religious, Jewish language.</sentence><sentence id="103">It was written in Hebrew letters, Rashi.</sentence><sentence id="104">And all her prayers were written in that language.</sentence><sentence id="105">So she considered that her religion.</sentence><sentence id="106">She was very religious, and she raised a very, very religious</sentence><sentence id="108">family.</sentence><sentence id="109">Anyway, going back to my mother, Rosa -- she finally managed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">And she falls in love.</sentence><sentence id="111">She falls in love with a musician.</sentence><sentence id="112">And what did he play?</sentence><sentence id="113">Accordion and guitar.</sentence><sentence id="114">And he had a gorgeous voice.</sentence><sentence id="115">The moment the family heard a musician -- I mean, it was something you should never even consider.</sentence><sentence id="116">A nice Jewish family -- I mean, a girl, a Sephardic girl, to marry a musician who plays for money?</sentence><sentence id="117">I mean, you are blessed with a voice.</sentence><sentence id="118">That means that God gave you a gift so you can help and share with other people -- not to take the money.</sentence><sentence id="119">But you know, nothing would help.</sentence><sentence id="120">And as much as they really respected the father -- you never questioned grandfather -- whatever he said, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="121">She decided to marry -- Samuel Poppel (ph.)</sentence><sentence id="122">was his name -- very handsome Samuel Poppel.</sentence><sentence id="123">And she found out very, very early that it was no big deal, because Samuel Poppel played all night and slept all day -- and at night, he was out singing , which is a Bosnian folk song.</sentence><sentence id="124">And after she had the baby -- she right away had the baby, little Floritza, which is me, she wrote a letter to her father -- "I want to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="125">And the father came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>, he arranged a real Jewish divorce, and took his daughter and little Floritza back to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And she brought shame to the family.</sentence><sentence id="127">A divorced daughter in the family?</sentence><sentence id="128">Never heard of it.</sentence><sentence id="129">Never was a divorce in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">So here she was with a child.</sentence><sentence id="131">She couldn't meet with a man because -- the single people -- single men are not going to look -- a divorced girl with a baby.</sentence><sentence id="132">So, she was very lonely.</sentence><sentence id="133">Her life was spent with her family.</sentence><sentence id="134">They sang a lot.</sentence><sentence id="135">They have, every Sunday, a picnic in different <span class="DLF">gardens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">And there was a lamb on a spit, and a lot of singing.</sentence><sentence id="137">So that was, really, her life.</sentence><sentence id="138">And I, actually, was never supposed to ask about Samuel Poppel.</sentence><sentence id="139">It was something you never asked, you never talked</sentence><sentence id="141">about.</sentence><sentence id="142">I never saw him.</sentence><sentence id="143">I don't even know what he looks like.</sentence><sentence id="144">But my grandfather went right away to work to find a husband for Rosa.</sentence><sentence id="145">The marriages were, really, arranged.</sentence><sentence id="146">The father, the grandfather, would call you, you would kiss his hand, and he would say, "I have a husband for you."</sentence><sentence id="147">You would kiss his hand again, and you were very happy.</sentence><sentence id="148">In one way, it was just -- it was very simple.</sentence><sentence id="149">You didn't have to worry about the singles, or "Where am I going to meet a man?".</sentence><sentence id="150">And usually, the father knew what the -- you know, what kind of man their daughter needs.</sentence><sentence id="151">So every little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebenica</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Travnik</span> as I told you before -- the families kept in touch, they visited each other, and they knew exactly who had daughters, who had sons, their ages.</sentence><sentence id="152">And in between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, there were such people as Casmententeros, the matchmakers.</sentence><sentence id="153">They usually -- it was a side job, besides what they were doing -- and they would get 20 percent here, and 20 percent on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">They would match, give parties.</sentence><sentence id="155">So they found a match.</sentence><sentence id="156">And it was a salesman who was traveling from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">They only spoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judeo</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">The salesman too.</sentence><sentence id="159">Everything was done in this Ladino language in between them.</sentence><sentence id="160">So his name was Mikaiel (ph.)</sentence><sentence id="161">Poppel -- no -- sorry -- Mikaiel Cabeelio (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="162">Poppel was my father who I never met.</sentence><sentence id="163">And Mikaiel Cabeelio comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span>, and meets Rosa.</sentence><sentence id="164">And by golly, she liked him.</sentence><sentence id="165">She was very picky, you know?</sentence><sentence id="166">She was a very pretty, pretty girl, pretty woman.</sentence><sentence id="167">I'll show you a picture later -- very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="168">And they arranged a wedding.</sentence><sentence id="169">Naturally, I was not at the wedding.</sentence><sentence id="170">I was sent to play with the cousins.</sentence><sentence id="171">It was something that was not part of me, which -- it hurt, you know, later on -- when you get older, you think back, "Well, how could they do that to me?".</sentence><sentence id="172">You know.</sentence><sentence id="173">Anyway, she gets married, and they go to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">This is what she wanted to do, to go live in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And they left.</sentence><sentence id="176">To</sentence><sentence id="178">my happiness, because I was going to stay with nona.</sentence><sentence id="179">And I adored that woman -- just adored.</sentence><sentence id="180">I think all the feeling that I have for this Sephardic culture, for stories, for songs -- it's all really a gift from her to me that I will have for the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="181">It was -- I considered her as my mother.</sentence><sentence id="182">I didn't miss Rosa.</sentence><sentence id="183">It's sad.</sentence><sentence id="184">But that's just the way it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="377">Q: How old were you when they got married and left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="379">A: Well, before nine.</sentence><sentence id="380">I was about seven, or maybe even younger, because I -- no -- seven, because I stayed with nona two years, until they got settled.</sentence><sentence id="381">And then, one day, my grandfather comes in with a hat on, a real hat.</sentence><sentence id="382">You know, I was used to seeing my grandfather dressed with a .</sentence><sentence id="383">All the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasencia</span> and all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- they were dressed the same as the Moslems.</sentence><sentence id="384">You wouldn't know which one's which.</sentence><sentence id="385">They all had , and shuck sheers (ph.) --</sentence><sentence id="386">that's pantaloon pants.</sentence><sentence id="387">And he put a hat on because, I guess, he wanted to look a little more modern.</sentence><sentence id="388">He was going to a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">And, oh, it was tough on me.</sentence><sentence id="390">I hated that day.</sentence><sentence id="391">I'll never forget it as long as I live.</sentence><sentence id="392">My nona gives me an orange bag with the pictures of my family, all my aunts.</sentence><sentence id="393">And she said , don't ever forget your Mishpachah (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="394">which is, really, a Hebrew word.</sentence><sentence id="395">But it's family.</sentence><sentence id="396">And she gave me a little gold locket, which I still carry with me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="397">And she said, "Anywhere you go, carry that with you.</sentence><sentence id="398">So those were the two very precious things that I had all my life with me, even today.</sentence><sentence id="399">I'll show it to you later.</sentence><sentence id="402">Coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> is like day and night, a difference of life and people and -- my mother -- I mean, I couldn't recognize my mother before anything else.</sentence><sentence id="403">She was very dressed up in very beautiful clothes.</sentence><sentence id="404">And my stepfather, my new father, who adopted me -- and I became Floritza Cabeelio -- he started a necktie business, and she was in business with him, very active, very -- this is what she wanted.</sentence><sentence id="405">This is the kind of life she wanted.</sentence><sentence id="406">She could not take that small, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> existence.</sentence><sentence id="407">And she mingled with -- socially, with the Ashkenazi Jews, who are a little different than the Sephardim in that part of the world.</sentence><sentence id="408">They were modern.</sentence><sentence id="409">They were from Austrian background and they spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">And socially, this is where she felt more important.</sentence><sentence id="411">The kosher that was completely gone.</sentence><sentence id="412">I don't remember anything that was connected to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasencica</span> that I could see in her.</sentence><sentence id="413">We did not speak <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">It was all SerbaCroation.</sentence><sentence id="415">And not only that.</sentence><sentence id="416">She had so many things prepared for me -- I think all the things she wanted for herself that she could never get -- had music lessons, piano lessons, ballet, and drawing, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maccabi</span> (ph.) --</sentence><sentence id="417">that's like, a health club -- three times a week -- had tickets for the operetta on Sunday afternoon -- Lahar, I knew all the Lahar pieces by heart at the time.</sentence><sentence id="418">It was too much to take actually.</sentence><sentence id="419">She had a maid who spoke to me only in German because that was the language, you know, a fine language.</sentence><sentence id="420">I couldn't -- I -- the only thing I would like to do is go back to nona and her Sephardi cooking, and her , and , and , all that Sephardi cooking.</sentence><sentence id="421">It was so good.</sentence><sentence id="422">And to hear their language -- I miss that the most, that Lingua De la Madri.</sentence><sentence id="423">And besides, I wasn't too crazy about Mikaiel Cabeelio.</sentence><sentence id="424">I always felt maybe he'll take a knife -- and come in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- I mean, I had that fright, until one day I come out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and there is Mikaiel Cabeelio waiting for me.</sentence><sentence id="425">He said, "Floritza (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="426">we are going</sentence><sentence id="428">to buy a harmonica today."</sentence><sentence id="429">A harmonica we called an accordion.</sentence><sentence id="430">And it was my dream to have an accordion.</sentence><sentence id="431">If you have a harmonica, you are usually very popular.</sentence><sentence id="432">Everybody wants to be with you.</sentence><sentence id="433">You can start a party -- but just the dream that I would never believe it would happen to me -- and we go to this -- the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, right near the <span class="DLF">park</span>, called -- I'll show you that picture too -- and, uh, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">music store</span>, and he said, "Floritza, pick any one you like."</sentence><sentence id="434">Well, I saw that little white Honer, 24 base (ph.).And I said, "That's the one I would like to have." "</sentence><sentence id="435">That's yours."</sentence><sentence id="436">And, you know, I fell in love with Mikaiel Cabeelio.</sentence><sentence id="437">I just-- he was my best friend.</sentence><sentence id="438">The harmonica did it.</sentence><sentence id="439">And we hopped <span class="BUILDING">home</span> through , west of the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="440">We live in the -- the is the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, not far from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="441">And we come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I'm all excited.</sentence><sentence id="442">I said to my mother, "look, I have a harmonica."</sentence><sentence id="443">Oh, she was very pleased.</sentence><sentence id="444">She knew how much I wanted to have that harmonica.</sentence><sentence id="445">I took it out, started picking notes.</sentence><sentence id="446">She says, "Oh, no way.</sentence><sentence id="447">You are not going to play music the way our family plays, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">No.</sentence><sentence id="449">You are not going to play by ear.</sentence><sentence id="450">You are going to have music lessons.</sentence><sentence id="451">This is the way the people in big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> do."</sentence><sentence id="452">And she found a teacher, a charming young -- charming young woman -- her name was Edat Schatsberg (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="453">And I took lessons twice a week, walked to her with my little friend, and she loved me.</sentence><sentence id="454">We just connected, you know?Not that I would come to the lesson -- she would give me a hug and a kiss -- you know, you don't hug and kiss every student who comes in.</sentence><sentence

you imagine a father seeing his son being beaten in the head, and the grandchildren being beaten, half alive, thrown in a <span class="DLF">hole</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1777">It's hard to

id="1795">My husband Harry said the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead.</sentence><sentence id="1796">We were numb.</sentence><sentence id="1797">But in one <span class="NPIP">way</span>, you know, I

had a purpose.</sentence><sentence id="1806">And I'm very glad, as horrible as it was, that I did go.</sentence><sentence id="1807">That evening, what is really unbelievable -- friends of mine of Berta, all Muslim kids, they knew who did it.</sentence><sentence id="1808">I mean, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was silent.</sentence><sentence id="1809">Nobody remembers what happened to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1810">Nobody.</sentence><sentence id="1811">They knew.</sentence><sentence id="1812">They came over and we had a party for Rosh

of today.</sentence><sentence id="2298">But they had never abandoned the and that my grandfather is wearing.</sentence><sentence id="2299">This is nona's family.</sentence><sentence id="2300">This is the singing Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="2301">Unfortunately, the men don't have</sentence><sentence id="2303">2 their instruments -- which I'm so upset and so sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2304">But my mother, Rosa, has her guitar, the one to the left -- actually, to the right from where I'm sitting -- and her sister, Luna (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="2305">has her <span

Rosa.</sentence><sentence id="2308">Always very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="2309">Now, this is my mother, Rosa, with her brother Layzo.</sentence><sentence id="2310">I think this was taken right before she left, after she married Mikaiel Cabeelio.</sentence><sentence id="2311">They were very, very close.</sentence><sentence id="2312">And the way that history brings things together, they were the only two survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2313">Can you believe that?</sentence><sentence id="2314">The only two survivors of the whole Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="2315">And this is

week.</sentence><sentence id="2323">These were my very dear friends, and .</sentence><sentence id="2324">Who knows where they are?</sentence><sentence id="2325">Who knows if they're alive?But look at the fashion.</sentence><sentence id="2326">I mean, we were all dressed up, always dressed up.</sentence><sentence id="2327">Well, I'm, here, I would say, about 13 years old in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> when I was taking accordion lessons.</sentence><sentence id="2330">3 This is it.</sentence><sentence id="2331">This is my friend

next to it is -- it's her sister.</sentence><sentence id="2334">This is not the little Honer, because I have gone to a bigger accordion.</sentence><sentence id="2335">But I'm still doing the same thing, I'm walking around, playing, playing mostly to <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span>, and playing the songs of our people, from their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2336">And I would usually ask them always, "What <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> do you come from?".</sentence><sentence id="2337">And if

id="2340">And I love her.</sentence><sentence id="2341">This is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corsila</span>, a beautiful, beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2342">As you see, the piece of blue water in front, that's where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> would dock daily.</sentence><sentence id="2343">And we would all stand there and wait to get any kind of news, anything; that is, what's going around the world.</sentence><sentence id="2344">Also from there, we took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tugboat</span> at night and -- when we ran away toward <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2345">Also, the children -- if you see that whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> -- we'd swim around it all day, every day.</sentence><sentence id="2346">And it's a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, even for a vacation, today.</sentence><sentence id="2347">It brings bad memories to me.</sentence><sentence id="2348">But it's a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2351">4 Well, believe it or not, the one in the middle is me, the teacher, the music teacher.</sentence><sentence id="2352">All of my students were a little older.</sentence><sentence id="2353">But this was the butcher's daughter and the baker's daughter.</sentence><sentence id="2354">And that's where my meat and bread and olive oil came from.</sentence><sentence id="2355">So they were really very important people in my life.</sentence><sentence id="2356">And this harmonica, actually, is not mine, because my father went to the City of Split to change for a bigger one.</sentence><sentence id="2357">So this one is borrowed.</sentence><sentence id="2358">But these are my students on the isle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corsila</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2359">Well, this was June 24th, 1945, the wedding day.</sentence><sentence id="2360">Take a look at that Sergeant Jagoda.</sentence><sentence id="2361">Isn't he a handsome man?</sentence><sentence id="2362">The wedding was really first class <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from the cake to the hamburgers to my dress made out of parachute.</sentence><sentence id="2363">I mean, everything was just first class.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And I love this picture.</sentence><sentence id="2365">Well, this is the farmer who started talking to us and telling us the story of the stormy night.</sentence><sentence id="2366">And we are standing, actually, on the spot where he was telling us that that is where my family is, both of these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2367">And this is where we were standing, just frozen.</sentence><sentence id="2368">This is really when I heard the whole story about the Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="2369">And the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> -- that's where they are.</sentence><sentence id="2370">One day, I hope to be able to go back and put something there, a stone, a music lesson, anything that is sort of connected with this Altarac family who gave me so much and left so much behind.</sentence><sentence id="2373">5 This is the badge that I talked about before.</sentence><sentence id="2374">It brings a lot of memories, a lot of pain, actually.</sentence><sentence id="2375">This was issued to every Jewish person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> -- and I'm sure in many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- and you would not ever leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> without the badge.</sentence><sentence id="2376">Because, God forbid, if they catch you without it, you are really in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2377">So miraculously, it just traveled with me.</sentence><sentence id="2378">I would make sure that this goes with me, plus my nona's bag with family pictures, and the little gold piece that you will see very soon.</sentence><sentence id="2379">There it is.</sentence><sentence id="2380">This is the locket that she gave me after I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> -- and "Keep it with you anywhere you go" -- and I sure did.</sentence><sentence id="2381">It's very old.</sentence><sentence id="2382">It's broken up.</sentence><sentence id="2383">But it's very, very dear to me. ,</sentence><sentence id="2384">keys from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2385">Most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sephardic communities</span> know the legend of the key.</sentence><sentence id="2386">When our ancestors left <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, they took their -- the keys of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> with him hoping that, one day, they will return.</sentence><sentence id="2387">I have written this song maybe 10, 15, years ago -- and it's on my first album, or second album -- where I'm asking where is the key that used to be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> that our ancestors brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2388">My cousin, Berta, when she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span> ___ that this Bosnian war -- she called me and I tried very hard to bring her to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, which I did, thank God.</sentence><sentence id="2389">And she said to me on the phone, "I left everything.</sentence><sentence id="2390">But I have the key."</sentence><sentence id="2393">6 This is my Uncle Layzo's watch.</sentence><sentence id="2394">Actually, my grandfather gave it to him for his good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, when Vlasenica had all that trouble and all the Jews were taken to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2395">After that -- the reason, I guess, that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> was such in silence -- everybody had something -- because all of a sudden, 15 families -- all their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were empty.</sentence><sentence id="2396">Somebody had to have all these things that were in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2397">My Uncle Layzo, after coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasenica</span>, looked, searched, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for something to remember his family.</sentence><sentence id="2398">He found nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2399">Finally, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2400">In one of the <span class="BUILDING">pawn shops</span>, he bought this watch.</sentence><sentence id="2401">And this watch -- his father gave to him.</sentence><sentence id="2402">And in fact, when you open it, you can see his handwriting, "To my son, Layzo, for the good grades in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2403">Education was always very important.</sentence><sentence id="2404">Again, a story of -- this, Berta gave me the first time I went to visit.</sentence><sentence id="2405">One of the neighbors was dying.</sentence><sentence id="2406">And she called Berta and she wanted to give her something.</sentence><sentence id="2407">It was on her conscience.</sentence><sentence id="2408">And she gave her this buckle that belonged to the Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="2409">As you see in the middle, it's a Magen David, and it was worn by one of my uncles, or -- I don't know whom -- but it belonged to the Altarac family.</sentence><sentence id="2410">It bothered the lady a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2411">So she gave it to Berta.</sentence><sentence id="2412">You know, a very talented musician of Sephardic music -- the group is called the Voice of</sentence><sentence id="2414">7 Sepharad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Paul</span>, <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> -- David Harris
