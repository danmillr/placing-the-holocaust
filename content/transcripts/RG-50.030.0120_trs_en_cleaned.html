<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Would you tell me your name please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Doriane Kurz.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in March of 1936.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Can you tell me about your parents, where they came from?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="12">I...my mother's name, maiden name was Klara Biberstein and she was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huszityn</span> (ph) which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at the time, part of the Austria-Hungarian empire and my father's name was Meilech Kurz.</sentence><sentence id="13">Uh he was known as Emil in the family and his early years, certainly in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> his official early years, he was known as Meilech Weiss, which was his mother's maiden name and uh that was because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in those years Jewish marriages performed by rabbis were not recognized by the state and the Jewish children were considered illegitimate and took their mother's name on official uh documents, so that I have some documents showing my father as Meilech Kurz.</sentence><sentence id="14">From very early years when he was eight I have some uh report cards from the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> on him and leading right on up to his compulsory time as a cadet uh in the service in the Polish army, which was mandatory, and uh and until he really became an adult he he was known as Meilech Weiss, his mother's name.</sentence><sentence id="15">So my father's name was Meilech Weiss or Meilech Kurz and my mother's maiden name was Klara Biberstein Kurz and both of them came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and uh my mother then grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> and my parents met and then married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we were born there, we being my brother whose name was given as Alfred Kurz and uh who is known as Freddie and who was born in the year 1937, sixteen months after me, so that there were four of us in the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q: Would you tell me what you remember about your very early childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: My uh very earliest tableau memories are from the time after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">We left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> with the Anschluss and went, eventually ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25">My father and his brothers and brother-in-laws and father had a world-wide business of selling optical frames with branches really all around Europe and as well at the time and we're talking about the 1920's and 1930's, the business was uh in what was then known as <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and there were branches all over Europe and there were plans of expansion into Asia and to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and uh at the time of the Anschluss various of the brothers...there were four brothers.</sentence><sentence id="26">My father had uh there were four brothers.</sentence><sentence id="27">He had three brothers and one sister, so at the time of the Anschluss there were my father, his three brothers and his brother-in-law and father and various of these uh family members were living in different parts of the world manning</sentence><sentence id="29">branches.</sentence><sentence id="30">My father's sister at the time was in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> with her husband and so their children were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and one of my father's brothers whose name was Michael was in in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">The branch was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> and he was there with his wife and children when the war started and after the year 1940 nothing is known of them.</sentence><sentence id="32">They...none of them survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="33">And at the time of the Anschluss uh some of the brothers were where their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were and some were traveling, but it became apparent very quickly that Jews should not remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">Uh there was...anti-Semitism was ripe and almost at once things like people who worked in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, maids and so on, uh became rude, insulting and took advantage of the fact that they either worked for Jews or knew Jews.</sentence><sentence id="35">It was a not good climate and everyone left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">All, all the family left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, or the immediate family left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">My father uh went eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> where we had a branch of the business in a in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span> and we followed.</sentence><sentence id="38">There were some uh stops between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and the time we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abbazia</span> which I think is in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>...somewhere on the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">There were some detours on the way out.</sentence><sentence id="41">I I tell all this because those things are really not within my factual recollections.</sentence><sentence id="42">My first tableau recollections are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span> and since we arrived there in the year 1939 I would have been three and so my earliest tableau memories are really in a <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> there learning colors with little fuzzy balls. (</sentence><sentence id="43">laughter) Uh we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span> uh for less than a year, and my father was in business there and the business was eventually extended into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and uh we then moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and it is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> that I begin to have more than tableau memories.</sentence><sentence id="44">They are really uh long specters of time that I can account for.</sentence><sentence id="45">I remember very well that when we first moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">residential hotel</span>, and my brother and I uh caught several childhood diseases at that time.</sentence><sentence id="46">I remember being stuck in a darkened <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> with him at the same time when we both had the measles and uh my father worked and my mother stayed with us.</sentence><sentence id="47">I I have lots of memories of our time in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, but uh they're not really relevant to this discussion.</sentence><sentence id="48">And from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, for some reason we we we shared an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with some other people by the name Nussbaum, whom I remember very well and who survived the war and who lived on the <span class="DLF">street</span> adjacent to the only <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> had for very many years.</sentence><sentence id="49">The word in Dutch for <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> is Wolkenkrabber which means a cloud scratcher, and we lived there and I have absolute memories of of that time.</sentence><sentence id="50">Uh I'm not sure why we shared an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, but I know from there we shared someone else's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and eventually we had our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in in uh on a <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> _(ph) in the southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> called (ph) and uh we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> there and my memories from that time on are are pretty complete.</sentence><sentence id="51">We must have moved to (ph) somewhere in 1940 or so, because by 1941 I know we were living there so I I don't know the exact dates that we moved but I can tell you it goes "40 to "41.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: What was life like for you as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Well, uh uh I suppose at that time...I mean I I have recollections as a four year old of things normal four year olds remember.</sentence><sentence id="86">I...friends of my parents, uh visits, wearing a snow-suit, uh</sentence><sentence id="88">playing on the <span class="DLF">street</span> uh in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, playing moving games with my brother and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and one of my early recollections really of really moving recollections are that I I seem to have been able to read at a very early age.</sentence><sentence id="89">I was interested in reading and uh learned how to read Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="90">Having having been born in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I guess my first language was German and my mother...when we moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> my mother never...1 remember never did very well in Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="91">Dutch and German are related languages and they are dialectally different and I remember my mother could never quite pronounce the Dutch properly which use to embarrass me.</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh my father spoke lots of languages since he was in an international business.</sentence><sentence id="93">I...we have some correspondence from him.</sentence><sentence id="94">He wrote fluently and spoke fluently several languages, and uh I remember that my mother, when I was very little...1 must have been around four...uh wanted us, wanted me...I don't really remember whether my brother was involved...but she wanted me to learn Hebrew and I remember she hired a red-bearded young rabbi who use to come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and sit me on his lap and taught me how to read Hebrew, so that I know I was able to read Hebrew about the same time that I was able to read vernacular Dutch and uh uh I...we were going to <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">I have pictures of some of those <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> things, performances and things from uh from my early days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">And then the first time that I really remember things having to do with the war...in fact there was uh one of the incidents related to the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>...uh we had to wear Jewish stars, big stars, yellow stars and uh uh I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wearing a star always accompanied by my mother and I remember one time in the uh <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> that there was an air raid and they sent us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> and they rushed us through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they covered us, our clothing up so that the Jewish star wouldn't get to be seen and uh I remember bombardments that were at least in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">I remember a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> being shot down and seeing a parachute come down.</sentence><sentence id="98">I remember once being out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> to get ice cream with my brother...we were allowed out by ourselves and we got caught in an air raid and uh we ducked...you weren't allowed to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">If there's an air raid you had to take cover so we ducked into a little <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="100">There was no all clear and after a while, a long while it seems to me, my mother came rushing past and we called out to her and she was crying.</sentence><sentence id="101">I guess she had gone out to look for the children, the two little children.</sentence><sentence id="102">We must have been six and five or five and four who were missing in the midst of the air raid so she must have gone out illegally and gone out to search for us, so I remember the Jewish star and being aware of that.</sentence><sentence id="103">Uh also wearing it one time and having some children say a a rhyme at us which was, in Dutch it goes: "Jood Jood op een poot, met een stukje rochedroot" (ph), which means, "Jew Jew on a paw, with a piece of black bread," but I didn't know I knew that still.</sentence><sentence id="104">That just came back to me now.</sentence><sentence id="105">Anyway, I I remember being somewhere in a <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> or something and two little boys saying that at me.</sentence><sentence id="106">Uh I was also going to an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>, in the first grade and uh learning with other children how to read and do arithmetic and then uh after a while I did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and I guess the time had come when Jewish, Jews could not, Jewish children could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="107">Uh I do not know from my own knowledge but from correspondence that I have from uh my mother</sentence><sentence id="109">uh from those times that in 1940 uh Jews were not allowed to do certain things anymore like go to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span> or go to <span class="DLF">parks</span>!</sentence><sentence id="110">and that by 1941 those rules had tightened to uh include time you could not go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley cars</span> which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was run.</sentence><sentence id="111">By 1942 you could no longer go in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> or into the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of the non-Jews and they uh could not come to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh I...my father's business employed several people many of whom were gentile and I know, I remember very well being taken to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sunford</span> which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">beach community</span> not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as a little child with one of those young women who worked for my father.</sentence><sentence id="112">She took my brother and me to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, so that much have been a great treat because we couldn't have been allowed otherwise" and I remember being on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> when there was a sound of a lot of bombing, of bombs, explosions and I don't know whether I'm right or not but I I seem to recall that somebody said something about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span>" and I I don't know whether...I don't know whether if we checked on it whether the big bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> happened in the summertime.</sentence><sentence id="113">I I couldn't tell you that that is so, but it's...but somehow it seems to be connected for me in my head.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh I...there were other outings that these people took us to.</sentence><sentence id="115">Uh life changed abruptly because I remember coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day from somewhere, <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> or something, to uh find my mother in tears and my father not there.</sentence><sentence id="116">I want to backtrack before I get to that because there were some things when my father was still there which uh I don't want to leave out.</sentence><sentence id="117">Uh I remember one evening we were sitting out...our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> had a <span class="DLF">bay window</span> overlooking the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I remember being in that <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and my brother was sitting on the bay window sill and looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and he said oh, look at that fire engine out there and my parents rushed to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and it wasn't a fire engine but it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and there were a lot of men in black uniforms that were jumping out of that, off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">It was a like a black fire engine kind of thing with men sitting on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they all ran off and my parents grabbed us and we ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that have flats are differently configured from the way we know them here.</sentence><sentence id="120">In order to get downstairs there were, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there were <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and then there were like <span class="DLF">stoops</span>, <span class="DLF">stairways</span> that went up from the from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and at the top of that <span class="DLF">stair</span> there was a <span class="DLF">landing</span> and there were four <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they led to four flats.</sentence><sentence id="121">Actually, in our case, they didn't lead to four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">They led to two <span class="INT_SPACE">flats</span> and ours so that our <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> took up half of that <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and the other two <span class="DLF">doors</span>, when you entered them there was a <span class="DLF">stairway</span> that went up off them up to the next level and there were flats and then there was another level and up there there were <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, and we, that evening when my parents looked out, they grabbed us and we ran into one of those <span class="DLF">center doors</span> and up the two flights of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> where we seem to have had a <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> that must have come to us with the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there were lots of things lying all over and we went into that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember my mother putting something over the <span class="DLF">keyhole</span> so that you couldn't look in and then they said, shhh...and we sat there much of " Decree No.</sentence><sentence id="123">138, came into effect on September 15, 1941. *</sentence><sentence id="124">Prohibition of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="125">&gt; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span>: May 14th, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="128">the night and we heard boots going up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I remember my mother crying.</sentence><sentence id="129">They tried to tell us to go to sleep, my brother and I, and we stayed there most of the night and when we came down in the morning I remember our <span class="DLF">door</span> was bashed in and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a wreck and it was the uh SS that had come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so it must have been one of the early attempts to gather up people for transports but they didn't find us.</sentence><sentence id="130">I I remember the sound of boots coming up close to us and going past our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so, I guess that was a miraculous escape because this must have been, you know, early.</sentence><sentence id="131">It must have been something like "41 or early "42 and so since uh it must have been at least a year and a half or two before actually we were taken so I suppose if we had not escaped it that night I would not be here to tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="132">It would have been another year and a half or two years, and so uh in that that was a natrow escape that we had.</sentence><sentence id="133">I also remember uh the place where we lived which was a like a nice uh middle-class or upper middle-class part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">For some reason my parents took us after that to uh the equivalent I guess of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">Very densely populated and I was very upset at that because I didn't know why and I said why and they said because we are going to be living here, and I didn't... 1 knew enough even though I was little to know that I didn't want to live in those very crowded surroundings and didn't quite understand it, but we didn't move and I...in retrospect I uh again uh I put two and two together and I think at some point my parents felt it necessary to merge or move away so that they would be able to to hide better and they must have thought that my moving into these surroundings they would be harder to find but it didn't happen and I I can't really answer for it.</sentence><sentence id="136">Uh uh I I'm going to skip back to now to a to the time when uh when I know life changed very radically.</sentence><sentence id="137">Uh I 1 I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and uh I know my mother was crying and there was a a family friend with her, a man who served as uh (ph) blower in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and whose profession was uh a green grocer.</sentence><sentence id="138">He and his wife were friends of my parents and their two boys were friends of ours.</sentence><sentence id="139">We spent some time together.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I...my mother was crying a lot and she said that my father was not coming back to us.</sentence><sentence id="141">He was taken prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="142">Uh I cannot tell you that I understood all the implications of that at the time, but I I I know what happened and, of course, as as an adult and uh I can fill in on some of those early things.</sentence><sentence id="143">Uh my father, as I said, was involved in the optical business and somewhere by 1942 Jews weren't allowed to have any business and they certainly weren't allowed to have any goods.</sentence><sentence id="144">Jews had to uh register with the Nazis and uh and they were restricted really to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they weren't allowed to uh do business anymore and at this point uh my father had to take whatever assets he had and he uh converted some of them into a diamond.</sentence><sentence id="145">Well one of the things Jews weren't allowed to do was to have uh jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="146">It had to be given up and uh my father bought a rather large stone which he, I gather, had as uh as a small item which he hoped he could keep and hide.</sentence><sentence id="147">Uh my goodness...I I find that in the telling of this I enter...my my brain is skipping about from early things to later things and I find that I would like you to refresh me in my memory later so that I may go back and tell you about the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, if you'll do that for me uh so I can continue this story with the stone.</sentence><sentence id="148">My father converted some of the assets to a diamond.</sentence><sentence id="149">| think uh probably many Jews tried to convert some of their assets into small items that they felt they could secrete without uh greater danger than had to be and so it was a rather large stone that he bought.</sentence><sentence id="150">I guess from, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, which was one of the diamond centers of the world, that was fairly common and</sentence><sentence id="152">uh he hid it.</sentence><sentence id="153">He hid that, and uh as Jews were not allowed to do business anymore he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> more than not, and he was bored and so he had friends who had worked I guess in the <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> and he began to uh visit them and my father had friends both Jewish and non- Jewish and uh he accompanied some friends who were willing to take the chance uh to the <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> and uh I guess at some point he must have felt he wanted to do something so he, I guess he wanted to do a little investing and with that in mind I suppose the thought came to him that in order to get some capital he needed to uh sell the stone, which was an eight carat diamond, and uh there was a person that he knew, a Jew who uh whose judgment he trusted.</sentence><sentence id="154">I guess he was one of these people who who was a...who knew a lot of people and who was one of these well-connected sorts that we all know who always seems to know a little bit about everything and has it right, and so my father uh consulted this man about the value of the stone and this man, who assured him that the stone had a greater value than he had been told it had when he had attempted to have it evaluated for sale before, advised him not to sell the stone yet, that he would try to get him more money for it.</sentence><sentence id="155">It was, of course, not known to anyone that this creature was working for the Nazis and that he had...he offered to deliver to the Germans this stone which he knew my father had in exchange for some further time saved from being transported for himself and his family.</sentence><sentence id="156">And so uh he denounced my father to the uh Nazis and uh my father and my mother were arrested and brought into for questioning and my mother denied knowing anything about it and my father also said that uh he didn't have the stone and uh he was then confronted with the man face-to-face and uh he was told that he would not get out unless he gave the stone up but if he gave the stone up that he would then be released.</sentence><sentence id="157">And this was uh...I think this was in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="158">I did make notes on that...uh it was in uh in 1942 in uh in August" and uh so eventually he gave in and he was brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they uh they were given the stone.</sentence><sentence id="159">My father took it out of its <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and gave it to them and uh they released my mother directly and they released my father in fact uh a day or so later, but both my parents realized that uh things would not be well for them and that they had to get out, so they attempted to find some ways out but by this time of course gentiles who consorted with Jews were themselves in danger of being transported.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh and uh there were people who at great, great danger to themselves uh uh went to the <span class="DLF">Belgium border</span> and attempted to find a way out for my parents.</sentence><sentence id="161">Uh there were illegal trans...ways out over the <span class="DLF">border</span> at night...uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and so on and uh but my brother and I were very small and the people who who led these expeditions out were afraid to take children along and so my mother then tried to get my father to go out on his own and he wouldn't leave us and uh a few days later they...my parents stayed hidden but it was all to no avail and my father was in fact arrested uh the very first time he went out again and he was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for having for having hidden and lied about this stone and he was kept in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for three and a half months and uh there wasn't any help for that.</sentence><sentence id="162">My mother was not badly connected through the, what was called the Joodscher Raad, the Jewish Committee and uh but there wasn't even...nobody really knew exactly where he was so this was uh in August of 1942, August the 6th, and uh he was then kept in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> called Vught in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for three and a

understood and known but I know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> uh had as...it was a less secure place than con...than real...the German and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish concentration camps</span>, and there were deputations (ph) from Jewish committees that were allowed in and out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and I believe even some of them, those deputations were put in the position of helping to determine who would be kept in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and who would be transported from there.</sentence><sentence id="171">I uh I mention this only because I think at...later on in in the story the fact that this was a less secure facility is, becomes material in uh in our story.</sentence><sentence id="172">Well, my father was sent uh to, after two weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133038" long="5.365989">Amersfoort</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span>, after two weeks there he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and there he made contact of course with this relative of ours, Dunio Kamerling and uh Mr. Kamerling uh used his best efforts to try to lighten my father's uh position in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> because my father was slated to be transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> directly as a special prisoner meriting special punishment.</sentence><sentence id="173">Uh we had not heard from my father in those months that he was prisoner or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133038" long="5.365989">Amersfoort</span> but uh immediately upon his entrance into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> my father sent us a letter which was taken out to us uh and he sent in fact in the next three days four communications, all of which I have, to my mother uh from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> through the underground or through members of the committee who were allowed in and out and uh he uh he mentions the fact that everything that happened to him was because of the betrayal and he was blamed for, from that for many other things by the Nazis, by the Germans and my mother tried everything she could.</sentence><sentence id="174">She knew officials and she went and she begged to have him remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> because he he wrote that he was slated for transport and uh Dunio Kamerling tried everything he could but nothing helped and he was sent out.</sentence><sentence id="175">Uh he arrived in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> on the 7th of November in 1942 and he was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on the 10th of November of 1942 and we had no other word about him and so we presume that he was exterminated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: You got a letter from your father much later that he had written on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="275">Can you tell us about that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="277">There were four communications so one every day and that last one which was written on the uh 10th of November in nineteen hundred forty-two is a very short little note</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="281">and it is in German and it says in effect uh, "Dearest Klara, my mother's name.</sentence><sentence id="282">Dearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klara</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">I am writing this letter on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> uh while we're standing and we are going to go further.</sentence><sentence id="284">I feel alright.</sentence><sentence id="285">Uh the uh the things that you sent me uh I got.</sentence><sentence id="286">I I'm taking them with me.</sentence><sentence id="287">There are a lot of things you sent.</sentence><sentence id="288">There were too many.</sentence><sentence id="289">I have too many things but I'm sure they'll be used.</sentence><sentence id="290">Uh stay well.</sentence><sentence id="291">All my love to you and the children."</sentence><sentence id="292">I will tell you that I have a a absolutely I remember that my mother, when she got the letter from my father, the first letter, was crying and I remember her packing a backpack full of things...soap and food and things and as I say, she had some connections to both the underground and to uh the Joodscher Raad and she got the package to him because that's what he referred to, that the things that she had sent to him he had received.</sentence><sentence id="293">And so uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> not, was not shut up tight.</sentence><sentence id="294">I mean if you had the right combination of money, I guess, and words or the right connections it was possible sometimes to do something still in the year 1942.</sentence><sentence id="295">Those things changed later.</sentence><sentence id="296">Uh Dunio Kamerling and Trude were both uh deported and after the war we found Trude Kamerling's name on the Theresienstadt deceased list and Dunio was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="297">eventually where he died.</sentence><sentence id="298">And so uh even for people who had whatever privileges there were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, time ran out for them too.</sentence><sentence id="299">At any rate, it is uh November of 1942 and my mother is now left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> with uh two small children and uh quite besides herself and uh one of those four communications that my father sent to her from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> said to her, asked her how she was managing all alone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and maybe she should take in someone else, a nice lady to live with her, maybe would be easier and uh so my mother interviewed some women and eventually picked a Jewish woman.</sentence><sentence id="300">My brother and I had to give up our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">I remember crying about that.</sentence><sentence id="302">We shared a little <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> and we didn't...anyway, we had to move out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> which was down at the end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> near the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and we had to share my mother's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> which caused a big to-do because in my mother's and <span class="INT_SPACE">father's bedroom</span> there was only <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for one extra little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, so one of us had to share her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and one of us was going to be able to keep our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I wanted both to keep my pretty little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and to share my mother's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">I I didn't want my brother to have that right, you see, so I remember crying a lot about that, but he got to share the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with her while I had to stay in my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, so...anyway this lady came to uh this lady came to uh stay with us. ___-- (</sentence><sentence id="304">ph) my mother was called down to the Joodscher Raad not to uh or to the underground not too much after she took this woman in because it turned out that this Jewish lady had a...she was single.</sentence><sentence id="305">She had a boyfriend and he was a Nazi and he was a spy and so after that things in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had to become careful.</sentence><sentence id="306">Most particularly I will tell you that I remember very well our <span class="DLF">bay window</span>, as I told you, and the <span class="DLF">bay window</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> next to us, which both stuck out and my mother and the lady living in that <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> used to talk all the time.</sentence><sentence id="307">It was a gentile Dutch lady and her husband who lived next <span class="DLF">door</span> to us and they were very active in the underground on behalf of Jews and they were exterminated and uh who knows whether this woman whom we took in and her boyfriend didn't rat on them, because it would have been very hard to have uh hidden that.</sentence><sentence id="308">Uh we were small, my brother and I, and the woman I guess became fond of us and uh I remember one day that she hid my mother under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen table</span> and hid us under something else and 5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="312">and...answered the <span class="DLF">door</span> to uh to the Gestapo and got rid of them for us somewhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">But I don't know, as I say, whether she was instrumental in having our neighbors murdered or her boyfriend of whatever, but I remember my mother telling us not to talk loud and not to say things so much so because it was none of that woman's business, and I understand now why.</sentence><sentence id="314">At any rate uh the woman and her boyfriend took a trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the year uh 1943 and uh they returned on the first evening of Rosh HaShanah at which time living in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> while she was gone was a family of four people...a man, his wife and the two children, and that was the man whom I had found with my mother the day when my father disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="315">That friend, he and his wife and his two children who had been picked up by the Gestapo and whom my mother had helped to liberate, somehow spring from their initial confinement and who had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go...one of the things that happened when the Gestapo took you was that they also came in and stripped the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took all your effects and uh so they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live and they came and stayed with us.</sentence><sentence id="316">After all the woman was not there and her boyfriend and I don't think anyone knew they were coming back and so...but they...it was right...1 remember it was Rosh HaShanah evening and the woman and her boyfriend came back and they had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and they brought us a gifts and I remember the gift that my brother got was a little wind-up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that wouldn't fall off the edge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> when it, you know, they're common now but we'd never seen anything like that, so anyway uh we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that night.</sentence><sentence id="317">I don't know how my mother must have felt.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="318">The woman there and those four people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> who weren't supposed to been there...the man, his wife and two children.</sentence><sentence id="319">They were sleeping in the main <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and my mother and I were sharing one of the little tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">office rooms</span> that were part of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and in the middle of the night uh the banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> came and I remember my mother got up and said to me, shhhh.</sentence><sentence id="320">Stay in.</sentence><sentence id="321">Stay absolutely quiet.</sentence><sentence id="322">And my mother and this woman went to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and what happened was that the woman showed her identity to the Gestapo at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they asked how many people were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the woman told them just the two of them, my mother and she, and this time however they took my mother and they took the woman.</sentence><sentence id="323">They had her come along, but they did not search the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at that very moment.</sentence><sentence id="324">So I remember my mother coming back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were sleeping and she just said, shhh...be quiet and do whatever the man who was staying there tells you to do.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="325">And then she was gone and we were...we got up right away.</sentence><sentence id="326">It was the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="327">It was very black <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">Nobody was allowed to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but we we went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and my brother Freddie and I were taken to, in the middle of the night, through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> by somebody...I can't tell you anymore who, and we ended up in a in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with a woman, a single woman.</sentence><sentence id="329">| didn't know that night where we were, but she was a gentile woman who was living on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> somewhere, and we lived with her for a few weeks and we had to stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> all day because being a single woman, the people who were below her knew that there was no one else living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she went to work every day, so she continued to go to work everyday, I guess because she didn't want anyone to suspect that she was working with the underground, and Freddie and I had to stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> all day but I mean this was uh...I was seven.</sentence><sentence id="330">He was six and children of seven and six don't do very well staying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> all day, so I remember we tried to stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, but we used to tiptoe out and uh I remember us being there for St. Nicholas day, which in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> St.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="333">0 Nicholas day is not really like Christmas here.</sentence><sentence id="334">It's a almost a national holiday.</sentence><sentence id="335">All children sort of take part in it and the woman was trying to make us interested in St. Nicholas and I didn't want to have any part of it.</sentence><sentence id="336">1 1 know I wanted very much to somehow get back to my mother and they said no, no, you can't.</sentence><sentence id="337">And then one day not long after that we were told that we couldn't stay there anymore and we were spirited away again with some people and we were brought to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>...I can't tell you where it was.</sentence><sentence id="338">Uh somewhere in the outlying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm district</span> where we were with two people whom I only remember by their first name.</sentence><sentence id="339">They were called Uncle Hank, Ome Hank and Aunt Jo, which amused us a lot because we could never figure out at the beginning whether it was Uncle Joe and Aunt Hank or visa versa.</sentence><sentence id="340">I remember a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a large <span class="DLF">backyard</span> and rabbits.</sentence><sentence id="341">And I remember playing a game, drawing with a stick in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dirt</span> and making <span class="DLF">pathways</span> and mazes and things.</sentence><sentence id="342">In retrospect I can imagine what an enormous chance people took to hide two Jewish children in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> out of outside of a main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where probably, you know, people just couldn't come up with two little children and pawn them off as something related to them if they'd never had them before.</sentence><sentence id="343">Uh so they must have taken an enormous chance in doing this.</sentence><sentence id="344">I I...we could never thank them.</sentence><sentence id="345">I could never...I never knew where I was because that chapter in our lives was cut short and uh in order to explain that I have to backtrack a little bit now.</sentence><sentence id="346">My mother had a uh sister who made it to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with her family and my mother also had a brother.</sentence><sentence id="347">Her brother uh had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> as early in in the 1920's and eventually came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then had to flee from everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="348">He was, I gather he got involved in the Russian something or other as well and he had to flee and he fled...it was very early times.</sentence><sentence id="349">It was the end of the "20's and he fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and he lived there and he married there.</sentence><sentence id="350">He married in fact a woman who was a Sabra even at that time.</sentence><sentence id="351">And he settled there and his name is Eliot Biberstein and he thank God is in this year 1990 still alive and well and he lives with his wife and uh their children and uh so her brother was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and uh we're now back here in the early 1940's...he knew that we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and not too much was heard from us.</sentence><sentence id="352">My mother managed through the Red Cross to send a telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> to say that we were still alive and this was...it must have been in like 1941 or beginning of "42deg which he got, and so my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> somehow heard of a an exchange that was planned between Palestinian nationals who had been caught by the war in <span class="REGION">German territory</span> and German nationals who were caught by the advent of the war in British-mandated <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and so an exchange was planned for these, among these people and my uncle contrived to try to get us on that list.</sentence><sentence id="353">Having received uh that cable from my mother he knew that my father was no longer with us.</sentence><sentence id="354">The telegram my mother sent said uh the children and I are fine.</sentence><sentence id="355">I haven't heard from Emile for a while, so he knew that, so he contrived to get the three of us put on that list, but we were not, of course, nor had ever we been Palestinian nationals and so uh he found the name of a woman who had been a Palestinian national who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was deceased and I guess money changed hands and uh that woman's name was added to my mother's name and my mother's picture and my brother and my picture were eventually put on a certificate attesting to the fact that we were Palestinian deg Date uncertain.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="359">1 nationals and that we were slated for repatriation.</sentence><sentence id="360">At the time that this happened my mother was already, had already been taken away from us and she had been sent also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> to which my father had been sent for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="361">Uh and my brother and I were what is called onderverdoken (ph) which means we were uh hidden, uh ducked under is the literal translation.</sentence><sentence id="362">Jews who were hidden were called, that was called onderverdoken (ph), so we were onderverdoken (ph) and my mother was by herself in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> uh when word was gotten to her through uh the Joodscher Raad and to and I maybe even through the Red Cross that she had been put for repatriation on a list with her children and my mother...I mean if I think about what this must have done to the poor woman...she was notified that she was going to be liberated and sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and her children were someplace that she was not even allowed to know about in case she was questioned.</sentence><sentence id="363">Hidden somewhere, somewhere and she must have been beside herself and half out of her mind at the concept of ending up in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, free with her children somewhere maybe picked up by the Nazis and then hidden and then punished for having been onderverdoken (ph).</sentence><sentence id="364">So she deemed it absolutely necessary for us to to to to join her so we could be sent out to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with her.</sentence><sentence id="365">So through the Joodscher Raad and the underground my mother had to try to find us.</sentence><sentence id="366">And she did.</sentence><sentence id="367">She did locate us, and so I remember one day uh Ome Joe and Tante Hank or visa versa, they said to us that my mother had sent word that she wanted us to come and that we should...they didn't think we should go but they had to send us and so they were going to let us go but that we should tell my mother when we got there that we didn't want to stay, that we should definitely come back to them, and we were put on the back of an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, or something with canvas or something and it was evening and the...I had a dolly with me.</sentence><sentence id="368">I was carrying a doll and my brother Freddie was carrying a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">They didn't send us with any clothes or anything.</sentence><sentence id="370">I guess they must have really thought that we were going to come back and we traveled a long time, all night and then it was dawn and somehow or other we went through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and there was my mother, and my mother did it, did this by uh giving out that we had been sick and had been left behind because we were sick or something... anyway, we joined her.</sentence><sentence id="371">Uh my mother having been arrested on the first evening of Rosh HaShanah, must have been in October of 19 uh 43 and uh we joined her about eight weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="372">It was late winter.</sentence><sentence id="373">Uh we were not uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> is pretty damp and cold and where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was on the borderline uh definitely cold and damp, and I remember going with her to a a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or someplace where there was a woman behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and there was a pile of clothes and my mother picking things through it and exchanging something for them, so she must have given away somethings that she had taken and I remember being in that little...those little <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> that Dunio and Trude Kamerling.</sentence><sentence id="374">I remember being in there, in their little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I remember sleeping in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> but being in their little... that's why I remembered that they were under special circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="375">I mean that wasn't just here say.</sentence><sentence id="376">I I remember them.</sentence><sentence id="377">And it was...1 remember it being very cold and I remember that this was the first time that Freddie and I learned some Hebrew songs and I know today that some of those were Haluts songs so that uh there must have been an active group of young Palestine, young Halutsim that uh were interested in in going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and making a homeland for the Jews and I remember learning some songs.</sentence><sentence id="378">I mean they're songs that everybody knows these days but I remember learning them at that time.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue

id="434">It's too mixed up, but given that we're now speaking about uh the very start of the year 1944, I was eight uh and my brother was uh seven, or not quite that.</sentence><sentence id="435">Uh I remember our first day or two in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">Uh this time definitely in a <span

remember one evening the women in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>...the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were all wo...our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was all women and children.</sentence><sentence id="440">Uh they got up and performed for each other.</sentence><sentence id="441">I remember my mother singing a song and being very mortified.</sentence><sentence

evening in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, but I remember it and I remember the song which is uh dealt...it was a German song and it dealt with a a woman who lost her husband and who was begging God to please spare her husband, so I remember that song.</sentence><sentence id="444">Uh and then uh we were moved into a different <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because the woman...the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had where people who were put in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>... mean when the Nazis wanted to know something they came to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> head and so this...the woman who was the head of that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a woman with whom we had lived for a short while, for a short while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="445">Not the one who lived by the <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="446">The other one, and uh this woman's husband was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and this woman, to the best of my knowledge, is still alive and her husband in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was very wealthy and she had special privileges.</sentence><sentence id="447">I can't tell you how that came about but I know that was so, and since my mother knew her, my mother contrived to get us into her <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we were in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with her.</sentence><sentence id="448">Life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>...oh, first and foremost I guess uh was <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="449">Uh it was everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="450">I I have a hard time being around barbed wire now, but the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> was every where.</sentence><sentence id="451">Uh our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was Dutch people.</sentence><sentence id="452">Uh again women and children.</sentence><sentence id="453">Uh very narrow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, triple-deck.</sentence><sentence id="454">Uh two low to sit up in...you you couldn't sit upright on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and there were two people to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>...the the uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were made of wood.</sentence><sentence id="456">There were just sides and wooden slats and straw pallets and they were very narrow.</sentence><sentence id="457">I think they were narrower than what we think of as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> and there were two people to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, so that there would have been six people to a stack and several hundred people to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and in the morning everyone had to get up very early and anybody over the age of fourteen or twelve or something had to go to work, and I guess we were lucky we were eight.</sentence><sentence id="458">Uh first there was a thing called appell, which was...everybody had to quickly get dressed and run out to the big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and line up by <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and by number in straight <span class="DLF">lines</span> and then we were counted, including the children, and on some mornings the count didn't check and the Gestapo", wearing those black boots and those jodhpurs and those those hats with the visors that you that they always wore, and always screaming, would keep us standing there until the count turned out the right way.</sentence><sentence id="459">And sometimes that was a very long time and then when the counting was over, then the grown-ups were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="460">I didn't understand then what it was.</sentence><sentence id="461">I I suspect now it must "ss.</sentence><sentence id="464">5 have been shoes that were taken from other Jews in various parts of the world where the Germans were killing people, must have been re-stitched or refinished for...so 1 remember the grown-ups marching away and somehow uh my mother contrived to not have to take that kind of a job but to have a job in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">And she did that I guess so that she could be with Freddie and me in the course of the day, or at least in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> because the grown-ups who were marched out to work, they left our compound.</sentence><sentence id="466">They were marched out of our <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> into the larger area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there smoke stacks.</sentence><sentence id="467">Uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> did not have a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> but it did have <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and I couldn't tell you in retrospect whether the smoke stacks were crematoria or related to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but I imagine it was the crematoria because uh not long after the grown-ups left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> uh there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>...open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> like like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span>, like the back of a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, that were dragged along without horses.</sentence><sentence id="468">There were people pulling them and uh they had uh corpses in them and the corpses were lying in all directions and uh heaped on top of each other and there were many people who died every night and they didn't make it out to appell but they were accounted for by being bodies and so after the grown-ups were marched out the uh there was a squadron of people that pulled this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> around and uh came into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and took the corpses and then they would, two of them would take the corpse...one at the feet and one at the hands and they would toss them up to the top of the heap and that uh happened every day.</sentence><sentence id="469">I still have trouble with that.</sentence><sentence id="470">And uh then for the day we children were left on our own.</sentence><sentence id="471">Uh again I I remember teen-aged children, older children taking some of us smaller children aside to secret <span class="NPIP">places</span> and teaching us uh songs of of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zion</span> and teaching us other lessons, and they were young people, very young.</sentence><sentence id="472">I mean I was a child and people in their twenties seemed like old people to me, and these I remember were older children, so they must have been young teen-agers.</sentence><sentence id="473">Uh there are other specifics.</sentence><sentence id="474">Uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom facilities</span> were a large, a large <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> for everybody, quite far from the other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="475">You had to go there and you had to go there for quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="476">You had to walk there and they were composed of uh a wooden plank, a large wooden plank and...with a with a front return and holes cut into the top of the wooden plank and there was an <span class="DLF">excavation</span> below it and so uh when everybody relieved themselves they they would just fall through the <span class="DLF">holes</span> into...I remember it was a very bad smell and uh I remember feeling very lucky that I didn't have to worry about going to work because before work there were so many people who went running there and then everybody had to wait for each other, and that I could wait to do that until after everybody was gone.</sentence><sentence id="477">Most of our time during the day, Freddie's and mine, was spent uh talking about food because uh there was not very much to eat and we were hungry much of the time, almost all the time.</sentence><sentence id="478">I don't remember that about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>.</sentence><sentence id="479">We must have uh had enough to eat there, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> the rations were uh the rations were three- quarters of a liter of watery soup made from uh a variety of turnips, uh and cooked in water.</sentence><sentence id="480">It was very watery.</sentence><sentence id="481">And three and a half centimeters of bread a day and and there was some kind of an Ersatz coffee because I remember there were some people who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they would come with those large uh...I don't know...like milk-can kind of things with a handle, one on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and I remember them carrying this heavy thing with both of them leaning sideways carrying that thing and we all had cups and things that you had to have your own, and they were also hidden in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="482">Everything was hidden in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="485">6 Your clothes were hidden in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and your and your eating utensils and whatever you owned had to be in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> including some kind of a a uh night pot so I...people had dysentery and you couldn't run out at night and go to those facilities so you had to have something, and all that was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was shared with two people and in our case uh I guess my brother being a boy, my mother shared her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with him and since I was a girl I shared it with another woman.</sentence><sentence id="486">We slept foot...you know, heads at opposite ends and so I remember taking uh a bowl or something...once a day you you go there and stand on <span class="DLF">line</span> and they would put in a ladle of that soup, Kohlrabi soup and uh in there and there was...and you had your little bit of bread and I remember my brother and I spending lots of time with our little piece of bread, cutting it for hours into the tiniest tiniest little, tiny squares that we could and then eating them...tiny tiny piece by tiny tiny piece so we could make it last as long as we could.</sentence><sentence id="487">Uh my mother worked in this uh <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and it was a good thing because uh somewhere along the way my brother got to be very sick.</sentence><sentence id="488">He had a kidney infection which in those years had to be...in order to get better you had to have a special diet, for some reason high in sugar.</sentence><sentence id="489">I I don't quite know why but I remember that and of course there was no such a thing except by special privileged characters and uh some of those privileged characters were a group of Greek people.</sentence><sentence id="490">I cannot tell you why that is, but the kapo, the head of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> was a Greek.</sentence><sentence id="491">He was a Greek Jew I guess.</sentence><sentence id="492">He was he was kapo.</sentence><sentence id="493">He worked with the Nazis and he oversaw appell in the morning and he had other Greek people, friends, and they were in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> by themselves and they had special privileges.</sentence><sentence id="494">Uh they had milk that was delivered to them for their children every day and once in a while there was chocolate milk because I remember my brother being in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> and the rest of us children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> used to line up when those Greek people got their special rations.</sentence><sentence id="495">We used to line up in case there was something left over or sometimes they used to give out the extra stuff to the rest of us children, and I remember lining up and getting some chocolate milk and bringing it to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>, which I was not allowed to go into, but I stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and kept yelling and yelling my mother's name till she heard it and I virtuously gave her this milk.</sentence><sentence id="496">I would like to tell you I was just being a good girl, but actually I used to hate milk and even under those circumstances I suspect that I I gave that up to my brother not so unhappily.</sentence><sentence id="497">Uh my mother, my mother uh happily then was working in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> so she was able to be with Freddie a part of the day, or at least look in on him uh because he was laid up for four and a half months, and he was not allowed to eat the stuff that we were getting and the other stuff was not to be had, so there was...it was touch and go whether he would make it through.</sentence><sentence id="498">I remember being in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> one day...they used to make announcements all the time in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="499">In the evening when the grown-ups came back, people used to go around and make announcements...they found something, they needed something and I remember being mortified one evening when I was standing in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>...somebody came around and started saying that there was a child in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> who was gravely ill and who needed sugar and did anybody have anything sweet to save his life - his name was Freddie Kurz or Alfred Kurz.</sentence><sentence id="500">I was so mortified that it was my brother... can't even tell you.</sentence><sentence id="501">So I guess people did do things for other people.</sentence><sentence id="502">I know in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> besides the Greeks there was a group of Albanians.</sentence><sentence id="503">Albanians.</sentence><sentence id="504">We didn't think very much of those people.</sentence><sentence id="505">They were, they were not literate or something.</sentence><sentence id="506">I I don't know why, and we thought they were dirty and</sentence><sentence id="508">7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, besides the amount of time we spent cutting our food small, we also spent, we children spent a lot of the day searching ourselves for lice.</sentence><sentence id="509">Uh this became an activity of uh glee.</sentence><sentence id="510">We all had lice and we used to comb our hair and try to catch the lice on the comb so that we could squash them with our thumbs, and since we were all covered with lice on our heads and fleas on our bodies...lice are horrible little grey things with a black spot in the middle and they lay little eggs in your hair.</sentence><sentence id="511">They have little white eggs and they stick on.</sentence><sentence id="512">You can't get it off, and they used to come around and uh shave our heads from time to time and I always tried to hide myself so my head wouldn't get to be shaved.</sentence><sentence id="513">I remember running to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> once when...I knew I had lice and if they found lice on you they would shave your head...and hiding myself and crying and fleas...the fleas, they were red.</sentence><sentence id="514">I don't know...they were long like little worms and you could see them on your clothes.</sentence><sentence id="515">The fleas gave uh people a particular sickness.</sentence><sentence id="516">They are carriers of a disease called spotty typhus.</sentence><sentence id="517">Typhus.</sentence><sentence id="518">T - Y - P- H- <span class="COUNTRY">U-S.</span> And everybody came down with it.</sentence><sentence id="519">Uh I did.</sentence><sentence id="520">I came down with it.</sentence><sentence id="521">We we all came down with strange things.</sentence><sentence id="522">We...besides typhus we had uh yellow jaundice...uh turned yellow.</sentence><sentence id="523">Your eyes turn yellow.</sentence><sentence id="524">Your skin turned yellow.</sentence><sentence id="525">Uh you're very nauseous.</sentence><sentence id="526">You have fever.</sentence><sentence id="527">Everybody had that lots.</sentence><sentence id="528">We...I had it twice.</sentence><sentence id="529">My brother had it twice, and my mother had it a couple of times.</sentence><sentence id="530">Uh and uh I came down with typhus...not...typhus was on a different level from the yellow jaundice because many of those morning corpses were corpses not...some from starvation and and many many from typhus, so typhus was a disease that gave you very high fever and it had a crisis period and if you made it through the crisis you survived and if you didn't make it, you didn't survive, and I uh got typhus in uh March of 1944 and uh and on the day that I was able to walk again, afterward two weeks of lying with typhus...in those two week, in that two week period heading towards uh was heading towards the end of the war, we uh began to hear bombardments very close by.</sentence><sentence id="531">In general in the time that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> which was uh for a year and three months, uh the bombardments were coming more frequently and it was the English who were approaching and on the day that I was able to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and walk we were notified that we were going to be evacuated, and so uh we were rounded up together with whatever other people were still around...not just from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> now but from all the other compounds in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and we were marched to a a <span class="DLF">railway siding</span> again and on that morning I remember a SS woman in boots and a skirt who was screaming at the top of my lung, her lungs and standing right by my mother and she suddenly was screaming to move along and she put her hand back and slapped my mother hard across the cheek.</sentence><sentence id="532">And uh then we were put on board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> and it had a ridged floor.</sentence><sentence id="533">It had ridges in it and it was a very long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="534">It had hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and uh we know afterwards, from the after the war, that the uh English having come that close to us uh the idea was to bring us to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, I think, and and gas us.</sentence><sentence id="535">But uh there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> pulling our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and every once in a while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would stop and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> would disappear for a couple of days and then it would come by pulling another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it would leave that other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and pull us again.</sentence><sentence id="536">And we were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for sixteen days.</sentence><sentence id="537">There was no food and there was no water and everybody became aware that we were going around in circles because we were coming to <span class="NPIP">spots</span> that everybody remembered seeing before.</sentence><sentence id="538">Whenever the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped there were some people who got out</sentence><sentence id="540">8 of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and foraged in the <span class="REGION">area</span> for grass or or potatoes or whatever they could scavage out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="541">We were obviously in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and there was not much possibility of really escaping uh and for water people went back and got water and brought it back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and everybody got sick.</sentence><sentence id="542">There there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit.</sentence><sentence id="543">Most people had to lie down and the lice were all over and whoever hadn't gotten typhus before, most people got it then.</sentence><sentence id="544">After sixteen days, half the people remained.</sentence><sentence id="545">We were liberated in what be, got to be East uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by the Russians, after sixteen days, and I remember when we were liberated the Greek man, the kapo, was crying and carrying his little three year old son, son's body in his arms because the child had died on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="546">My mother had gotten typhus about two or three days before we were liberated and she was delirious.</sentence><sentence id="547">At some point there were no more German soldiers around us and uh and everybody began to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the Russians were there and they told us to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and so uh the people around whom the three of us had been sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, other women with children, took my my brother and me along and the Germans living in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were thrown out by all of us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we took over their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and so there were several women and their children who took a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took my brother and me along and I remember Freddie and I found a little, like a little flexible <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flyer wagon</span> with a long handle and we went back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we got my mother out and we put her in the little flexible flyer and we dragged her to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and put her to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">And it was a very contagious thing, uh typhus, so nobody wanted to uh come near her for some days or a week and she was delirious and she didn't recognize me but I had to take care of her cause there wasn't any one else to do it, and I remember what our first meal was.</sentence><sentence id="549">When we when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was a sack of potatoes and the women took the potatoes and boiled the potatoes and our first meal...1 remember sitting, all these people around that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> just eating boiled potatoes with salt and I still remember how they tasted, and and it was April and they must have been new potatoes so they really must have been good, not just that they were the first real meal.</sentence><sentence id="550">We just ate and ate till we couldn't eat any more.</sentence><sentence id="551">I uh have a soft spot for boiled potatoes to this day.</sentence><sentence id="552">Everybody ate all that food and then my mother was still delirious and I, somebody said to me, this is the crisis if she gets through it.</sentence><sentence id="553">But I was a child and I knew my mother was going to make it through.</sentence><sentence id="554">I was afraid but I...it was not comprehensible to me that she would not survive it, and uh oh one...it was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> and there were fruit trees and there were berry bushes.</sentence><sentence id="555">I remember...there were berries and we picked them and ate them, and my brother was always mischievous and always adventurous and he went off by himself one day to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> which had a coal bin and if there was some way to get dirty, my brother found it, so he stood on the coal bin and was playing in the coal and pushing the coal aside and found in the coal bin like a potato sack and he came running upstairs and he got all the grown-up ladies and everybody ran downstairs and there they had hidden, in the coal bin, jars and jars of preserves, preserved fruits and everything, so I remember eating all that and uh it must have been one of the first days that my mother was back to her own self again, because I remember that she ate some of them and I remember saying, asking whether Freddie shouldn't get something extra cause he had, was the one who found it, because they divvied everything up into little parts.</sentence><sentence id="556">And then after some time there were Russian people there and they were at the beginning very</sentence><sentence id="558">9 friendly and then I remember there was, they were less friendly and then at some point we were gathered up.</sentence><sentence id="559">I had found a doll, a doll that I had found in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I I had busied myself on those days making little outfits for the dolly from rags that I found and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and a thing, and one morning we were all gathered up together and we were put into groups for transport out and someone stole my doll.</sentence><sentence id="560">It disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="561">And we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were transported, eventually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leip</span>...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">Somewhere, either on that trip or afterwards when we were out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> and back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, but I think on the first part because it was not long after the end of the war, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and everybody was cheering because all that you could see was bombed out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...just <span class="DLF">walls</span> were standing.</sentence><sentence id="563">Most of those were being held up with poles and I remember all those Dutch people just cheering and and along the way, along the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>, there would be German people looking up at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross train</span> with their mouths open and the Dutch people would go there and say, Heil Hitler to them and laugh and laugh.</sentence><sentence id="564">And so we were in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> in a what must have been a military uh <span class="BUILDING">battalion headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">We were quartered in a <span class="BUILDING">battalion headquarters</span> where Freddie one day found some machine with gears and stuck his finger in and cut off the top of his fingers.</sentence><sentence id="566">I remember.</sentence><sentence id="567">He's got bumpy tops on those fingers to this day, and a lot of blood.</sentence><sentence id="568">And we came...we were brought to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> uh in June of 1945 and my mother was still with us.</sentence><sentence id="569">She recovered from the typhus uh and we were we were in back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="570">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maastricht</span> and there of course we had had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the the conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> were very bad and we were treated more like prisoners, locked in and so on, nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my mother was able immediately to notify our family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> of the fact that we were alive and to and to ask for their help, and the communications that I, that my mother wrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the documents that uh uh we have from from the times we were being returned after the war are in my possession, and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the Dutch citizens who were brought back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="571">First allowed them to go back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, which were given back to them, but we were not Dutch citizens, having been what was called stateless and uh so it took time for us to be allowed back.</sentence><sentence id="572">We were sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> first to some other <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> type of thing because I remember lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> one day in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and looking up and there was my my oldest friend, Naomi Moskowitz (ph) with whom I had been friends since <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="573">She stood there at the foot of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">They had she had survived the war too, and we were uh we were allowed to take, get our old get our old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back and uh just about at that time my mother, who was racked with pain all the time was no longer able to uh bear her pain and uh went to the doctor and was found to have uh bumps, lumps uh and she uh never really recovered.</sentence><sentence id="575">She had some operations.</sentence><sentence id="576">My family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> having been notified that we were alive was sending communications to us and the family whom my mother had hidden in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> the night that they came, and those friends of hers, that whole family survived the war, the two children having been hidden that night when Freddie and I were hidden...those two children were hidden too separately and the two adults were hidden separately and all</sentence><sentence id="578">0 managed to survive the war...and at the end of the war uh we made contact with them again, my mother did, and when my mother became very sick we were sent to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where they were living out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and my mother, with much pain and some surgery and much help from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, died in uh March, the beginning of March of 1945deg.</sentence><sentence id="579">Before she was incapacitated totally she made uh an attempt on her own to get in touch with the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> again to ask that...my father had made application to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> back in 1939 when we first entered <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for a visa and I have much correspondence from that time, form letters from the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> saying this by no means says that you're going to be allowed in and we make no representation, but you better supply us with such and such documents and then follow up things of the same sort, and uh after the war my mother uh made contact, uh wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> and asked that we should be reinstated for visa uh but nothing came of it.</sentence><sentence id="580">I think the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> and even the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> uh were not re-established in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="581">Uh it became clear that my mother was not going to survive and one of my uncles uh, one of my father's brothers came over to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and my mother...and another brother of my father, a man by the name of Benjamin Kurz who died in 1957 and who was made guardian of my brother and me, then saw that he needed to get some permission to have the two children brought to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="582">Well, there were I guess millions of people trying to arrange to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war and the quotas were very tight but uh my Uncle Benjamin didn't let anything stop him.</sentence><sentence id="583">He went down to see President Truman.</sentence><sentence id="584">He wrote to President Truman and he went to see President Truman and he got to see President Truman's secretary and a special bill was introduced in the Congress to allow my brother and I to come in.</sentence><sentence id="585">Uh in the mean time it had been determined that the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> was not going to be opened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> soon enough and when my mother died, my brother and I were brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to establish residency there and possibly try to get in with my uncle's help and President Truman's through the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and so we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> over the summer and my Uncle Benjamin arranged, managed to get that bill there through the Congress and uh we were given a number and at the end of uh July of 1945'deg* we were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> from the from the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> that we'd been placed uh while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because we were alone, and we were put on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> alone and uh a lady was paid to make sure that we got to meals and so on, and so we two children sailed on the uh in the Swedish-American Line at the end of July of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="586">Uh fourteen days later we uh arrived in the port of New York in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, having survived what nobody told us was a uh drill, an evacuation drill...they just blew those horns and told us to get to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">life boats</span> and I remember crying cause Freddie and I had been put into different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">life boats</span> and I didn't know it wasn't the real thing and I thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was sinking and uh so I remember that uh and then we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="587">When we arrived a group of men came running up to us on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and wanted to take our picture and I realized of course in retrospect that it was the press and that they'd been given a list of people deg Date uncertain.</sentence><sentence id="588">Date uncertain.</sentence><sentence id="591">1 who are arriving that might be of interest to their newspapers and we were one of the first children allowed in to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, especially on our own, and uh so they positioned us on the <span class="DLF">ship's railing</span>, standing up and my Uncle Benjamin came on board to get us and saw all these men surrounding two children teetering on the ship's edge and started yelling at them and took us off and our pictures were taken looking through a small, a little life preserver.</sentence><sentence id="592">I had contracted uh a skin disease called impetigo, a very bad skin disease and extremely catching and uh I would not have been allowed into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> without a stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> but uh I had, I got a series of...on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>...I guess penicillin had just become available...this is 1946.</sentence><sentence id="593">I was given shots, four times a day and four times a night.</sentence><sentence id="594">Every three hours they came and gave me injections in my rear end of penicillin in an effort to cure it.</sentence><sentence id="595">It didn't cure it but I remember we, I had...Freddie and I slept in different <span class="INT_SPACE">state rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="596">I was in one with three other women, double decker <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, four to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> and I remember them...they all...they came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> and woke me up at night a few times and gave me a shot in my rear end.</sentence><sentence id="597">I was very sore.</sentence><sentence id="598">The impetigo didn't go away and the lady who had been paid to take care of us, I guess with the connivance of the ship's doctor, I don't know...put gloves on me.</sentence><sentence id="599">Particular one glove cause I had the impetigo very badly on one hand, so you can see when you look at the picture...there's this child wearing one glove and one not glove and we were smuggled through and I did not have to stay on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> and so Freddie and I came here and to grow up in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of my Uncle Benjamin and his wife and his two daughters, my father's brother.</sentence><sentence id="600">And uh to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had managed to come before the uh 1941 that Uncle Benjamin, my father's other brother Charles Kurz and his family who had fled and who had managed to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> via a stay in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and eventually they came here.</sentence><sentence id="601">Uh my father's sister who with her husband had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> and in that branch...they managed to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="602">The brother who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and his family was never heard from again, and my father of course died.</sentence><sentence id="603">My mother's sister and her family uh came here by way of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and my mother's brother had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">Uh I guess my mother must have doubts of surviving the war because uh from the earliest times on during the war she drilled into Freddie and me the address of both my uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and the address of my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and uh we could have been awakened any time of day and night and could have could have recited those addresses because so many children were left alone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> without parents, parents who died, and who...I guess my mother must have wanted to make sure that we would not just become displaced children, since we had family that we would know where to tell them to send us if we survived and so I know we uh we knew those addresses from a very very early age on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: We need to move on so we have time for the photographs, but I wanted to ask you uh if you could very briefly, what was your adjustment to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Uh, we arrived here on August 5th, 1946.</sentence><sentence id="786">Uh we had had, my family had arranged for us to have some private English lessons in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and when we came here, there was one month to go before we were to enter <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and uh we had some private English lessons so by the time <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started in September uh we knew a few words of English and uh we were</sentence><sentence id="788">2 entered in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">We...my uncle and aunt and their two children, one of whom was exactly my age, three months difference, and one of whom was two years older, lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">two room apartment</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brighton Beach</span>, and suddenly there were four children and two adults in two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, and the man downstairs uh could tolerate the noise.</sentence><sentence id="790">I remember him coming up with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baseball bat</span>, and we were put to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> almost immediately in September.</sentence><sentence id="791">Uh I have the compositions I wrote in that first half year.</sentence><sentence id="792">Uh children learn languages extremely quickly and uh I we adjusted well like that.</sentence><sentence id="793">Uh I will tell you that uh we came through it pretty well.</sentence><sentence id="794">From my point of view uh I guess the best thing my parents ever did for me was to give me a brother.</sentence><sentence id="795">I felt in in certainly the first part of my life, I mean for the decade after we came here, I I'm not sure I would have made it through so well if I had not had him because uh I I suspect that the reason that my recollections are are very good through all this period is because they are connected, they are my only connection to my memories of my parents and to my memories of my own beginnings.</sentence><sentence id="796">And I must have determined at a very early age that I wasn't going to let go of those and so I guess I mean sometimes people have better memories and sometimes they have worse memories, so I guess I was gifted with a better memory, but besides that, I I felt I felt very close to my brother in all the years I was growing up and I I'm sure he felt that way about me because we had shared something which we never really could share with anybody else, and I think my adjustment was OK because of that.</sentence><sentence id="797">I would tell you that we went, we came here in August of 19 uh 46.</sentence><sentence id="798">In the summer of "47 we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span>, for two months in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and all of a sudden that summer I became unable to eat.</sentence><sentence id="799">I was not able to swallow.</sentence><sentence id="800">Uh I...it took me about two years to be able to swallow again, and uh I can't tell you why that was but I'm sure it was as a result of my experiences.</sentence><sentence id="801">It was...in the forties one didn't send children to psychiatrist and all that.</sentence><sentence id="802">They seemed to be functioning OK and I was functioning alright in all other ways and of course we were lucky...we we had a family here and people who took us in as their own children and brought us up as their own children, and those people not only brought us up as their own children, but they were...they knew my parents and so we were able to maintain our own identity and still become part of their family, and so, you know, I was lucky that way.</sentence><sentence id="803">And uh I'm sure a whole lot of our personalities have been formed by those experiences.</sentence><sentence id="804">I I would say we are both exceedingly self-reliant people and uh I think that has something to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="805">I certainly didn't have a normal childhood.</sentence><sentence id="806">We didn't have a normal childhood and I had much more responsibility than...heaped on me...than most children have.</sentence><sentence id="807">My mother charged me with the care of my brother, if anything happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="808">Uh the time I had to take care of her when she was sick.</sentence><sentence id="809">I have letters that I wrote to my mother as a young child of six, seven, eight, in which I tried to comfort her and assure her that my father would be found after the war.</sentence><sentence id="810">They're not...they weren't things with which children are normally concerned.</sentence><sentence id="811">Childhood is a time of carefree uh selfishness and I don't think we had those opportunities and I'm sure those that had a bad effect on me and I'm sure it had some good effects on me.</sentence><sentence id="812">I found I'm uh more self-reliant and less willing to let other people do for me and I think that had something to do with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
