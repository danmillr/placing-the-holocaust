<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q:Morning.</sentence><sentence id="2">Could you tell us your name and where you were born and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A:My name is William Dowdell Denson.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born the 31st day of May, nineteen hundred and thirteen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span>, <span class="REGION">Alabama</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q:And can you tell us a bit about your education?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Well, I was actually educated in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">In nineteen hundred and thirty when I was 17 years of age, I was appointed to the United States military academy at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">I entered there in July of that year, and I graduated from there in June of nineteen hundred and thirty-four.</sentence><sentence id="14">I resigned my commission in the United States Army and was accepted as a student at <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Law School</span>, which I attended from September of 1934 until graduating in June of 1937.</sentence><sentence id="15">That is the basis of my undoing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="21">Q:And how come you got interested in the law?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Well, I guess that was kind of natural.</sentence><sentence id="24">My great-grandfather on my mother's side was a member of Congress in eighteen hundred and fifty-five and continued there until <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> succeeded from the Union.</sentence><sentence id="25">At that time he became a colonel in command of the 37th Infantry Regiment of Alabama and participated in the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vicksburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">He was a lawyer and enjoyed the law apparently very much.</sentence><sentence id="27">On my -- his son, rather, would go back -- take the <span class="REGION">maternal side</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="28">My great-grandfather that I just described had a son by the name of James Rendar (ph) Dowdell.</sentence><sentence id="29">He also was a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="30">And, in fact, he was a chief justice of the supreme court of <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> which is the highest judicial court of that state.</sentence><sentence id="31">And my father, I'm skipping now to my pappy's side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he, of course, was a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="32">And his father was a</sentence><sentence id="34">congressman and the United States attorney for the northern district of Alabama.</sentence><sentence id="35">So I sort of come by the law in a natural fashion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q:And going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> in --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q:Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A:Excuse me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q:Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A:I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> back after I graduated both from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> to teach law there in January of nineteen hundred and forty-two and taught law there until January of nineteen hundred and forty-five, at which time I was ordered to join the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the United States Army, 3rd United States Army.</sentence><sentence id="63">And I was a member of the judge advocate's section of that army.</sentence><sentence id="64">And I joined them in February of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="65">Now, my duties in the judge advocate's section in the Headquarters 3rd Army was to have charge of the administration of military justice, which was familiar to me because of my teaching also of military justice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> from "42 until "45.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q:Can we go back just a little bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A:Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q:When you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, the Nazis had taken over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">And when you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws had been passed.</sentence><sentence id="80">Was there any discussion at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> about what was going on in Nazi Germany that you can remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A:No, sir.</sentence><sentence id="85">At that time, and because curriculum was kind of rough and tough for a country boy like me, I didn't concern myself with much more than trying to study the cases that had been assigned.</sentence><sentence id="86">And there wasn't much discussion either from the professors, nor among the students as to the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="87">And nothing -- I knew nothing of the Nuremberg Laws other than the fact that there were indeed Nuremberg Laws that had been passed.</sentence><sentence id="88">And as such, they were discriminatory highly, and something that hardly anybody could be proud of.</sentence><sentence id="89">But there was never any teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> about the Nuremberg Laws at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q:When did you first become aware of oppression in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A:To be honest with you, the first that I really recall was Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="99">That was in November of nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, if I'm not mistaken.</sentence><sentence id="100">At that time the pogroms had started.</sentence><sentence id="101">And actually they started even before then.</sentence><sentence id="102">But that was the event that produced a notoriety in that I think the whole world knew about it from that time or from that time on.</sentence><sentence id="103">And it was rather a shock to me, because I had a number of very dear friends who were Jewish that I had grown up with in <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span> and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">So it was -- it came as quite a shock to me that that sort of thing was then taking place.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q:Did you know anything about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> that had been coming from Europe to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and was not let -- people were not let into <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and then they weren't let in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A:No.</sentence><sentence id="121">I never heard that until I became more involved with this matter.</sentence><sentence id="122">War crimes and indiscriminations that had occurred.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q:So that until you became involved in the war crimes trials, your knowledge of what was going on was really quite small then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A:lt was negligible.</sentence><sentence id="129">And I knew even less about communism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:So tell me, did you want this job in the judge advocate's office?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:I would say this, that probably I recognized it as a professional challenge and one that I would certainly like to entertain.</sentence><sentence id="135">And I considered myself fortunate to have received the designation in that capacity.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q:But you didn't know what you were getting into?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: certainly did not.</sentence><sentence id="144">I would do it again, though.</sentence><sentence id="145">Even now that I know it.</sentence><sentence id="146">But I think that I started to say I wouldn't change anything, but I'm sure that upon reflection I might have changed a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="147">But I couldn't tell you right now what I would have changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q:When did you first become immersed in the kind of material you would be confronting, the kind of evidence you'd be confronting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A:Well, in <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> we had a war crimes team that went along with the combat troops.</sentence><sentence id="156">And that was true in all of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">combat units</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">The war crimes investigating teams were groups of individuals, lawyers, investigators, and supporting personnel, that investigated atrocities as the combat troops uncovered them.</sentence><sentence id="158">And some of those things drifted into the <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> of 3rd Army.</sentence><sentence id="159">And our judge advocate -- I mean a staff judge advocate at that time was a colonel by the name of Colonel Charles E. Cheever (ph).</sentence><sentence id="160">And he had an assistant by the name of Josephs that was handling the war crimes aspects at that time.</sentence><sentence id="161">They were later handled by a classmate of mine, as I said, Colonel O'Connell.</sentence><sentence id="162">But in the conversations, the existence of some of these atrocities did become the subject of our conversations.</sentence><sentence id="163">So it was, I would say, before, slightly before, not much before May 7th of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="164">And, of course, May 7th was the day when hostilities ceased.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q:So you learned something before you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A:No, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="178">May 7th of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="179">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="180">I went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Army</span> in February of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="181">But actually I don't remember very much war crimes activity until we were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> at the rear echelon of <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Amny</span> was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">And I think it was there when I really first learned anything</sentence><sentence id="184">about t he war crimes proceedings that were being uncovered and the events that took place thereafter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q:Can you tell us some of your first impressions as you began to look at this evidence for the first time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A:Well, the first time that I ever had a chance to look at the evidence actually was, I think, in the beginning or middle of August of nineteen hundred and forty-five.</sentence><sentence id="198">And those were some of the reports and findings that the war crimes investigating teams had made to the judge advocate's section in <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters 3rd Army</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">Patton was the commanding general at that time.</sentence><sentence id="200">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teams</span> that would be actually at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was just 17 kilometers west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And at that time we were conscious of what was -- had gone along at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't actually visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> until I think some time in July of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="203">Our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were in the-- what they call the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">And 17 kilometers didn't particularly interest me at that time at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q:What was the nature of the evidence that you were looking at when you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A:At that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q:From the war crimes team?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A:From the war crimes team were reports that were sent in by the investigators and interrogators.</sentence><sentence id="220">And to look at them and to read them was not to comprehend them.</sentence><sentence id="221">Not that they were written in incomprehensive language.</sentence><sentence id="222">But the events that they described were incredible.</sentence><sentence id="225">And at first there was sort of attitude that this -- some of these people had too many Schnapps when they were writing the reports.</sentence><sentence id="226">But that of course is in jest.</sentence><sentence id="227">Never was any such feeling toward the investigators at all.</sentence><sentence id="228">But the events that they described were so incredible that you couldn't help but have a feeling of that, the presence of being depicting events and reciting events in the reports that were so far out from the normal course of events that it was just incredible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q:There were a number of lawyers with you?</sentence><sentence id="241">About 30 lawyers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A:In the --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q:That were working with you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A:At that time we had quite a number of lawyers in the judge advocate's section.</sentence><sentence id="249">And in the war crimes teams there were actually quite -- I don't recall at this particular moment how many lawyers there were.</sentence><sentence id="250">But investigators, interrogators and lawyers were 40-, 50-odd individuals.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q:Did you talk about this evidence that was coming in?</sentence><sentence id="255">Were most people equally as incredulous as you were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A:Well, I'm sure that they were.</sentence><sentence id="259">I don't think there's much doubt about the fact that anybody that came in contact with them, with the evidence, of course, they saw it.</sentence><sentence id="260">It was a credible matter</sentence><sentence id="262">to them.</sentence><sentence id="263">But from the secondhand on, it was an incredible matter.</sentence><sentence id="264">And the biggest problem that I had after I was designated to prosecute these case, the biggest problem that I had was believing or getting testimony that could be believed.</sentence><sentence id="265">Because of it's nature.</sentence><sentence id="266">Not that it wasn't true; it was true.</sentence><sentence id="267">But the events that were depicted were so horrible, were so sadistic, were so monstrous, that they were incredible.</sentence><sentence id="268">That's the only way to describe it.</sentence><sentence id="269">And I was a skeptic.</sentence><sentence id="270">I didn't believe it at that time.</sentence><sentence id="271">I didn't start believing it until I really started digging into with the concept and with the authority that I was going to prosecute the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau concentration camp</span> case.</sentence><sentence id="272">At that time when I started talking to witnesses, and I heard events there that were so out of <span class="DLF">line</span>, that they were incredible.</sentence><sentence id="273">I could give you an event that perhaps might depict it.</sentence><sentence id="274">In all of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span> there was some <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> which were called the <span class="INT_SPACE">standing cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">They were instruments of torture in reality because they were so small and so constructed that it was almost impossible for -- almost impossible--it was impossible for a prisoner who had been committed to one of these <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span> to either lie down or to sit.</sentence><sentence id="277">He had to stand in order to be within the confines of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And these $.S. men who were in charge of the <span class="INT_SPACE">arrest bunker</span> would put prisoners in there for punishment.</sentence><sentence id="279">They received no food, no water, and no chance to sit down or lie down, or change their position for three to five days.</sentence><sentence id="280">And sometimes longer if they lived that long.</sentence><sentence id="281">Then at the end of the period of time, they'd take them out.</sentence><sentence id="282">And if they were still alive, they would sit them down to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">And on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> with two or more liters of water in it.</sentence><sentence id="284">Well, the poor emaciated prisoner starved by thirst and absolutely out of his mind took the liters of water and guzzled it down immediately.</sentence><sentence id="285">That caused the stomach of this emaciated prisoner to protrude out.</sentence><sentence id="286">When that happened, the S.S. man who was there would drive his fist into that stomach.</sentence><sentence id="287">Or if he couldn't sit, throw him down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and then stomp that protruding stomach with his heel, rupturing the walls of the stomach, and the prisoner died of an agonizing death.</sentence><sentence id="288">Now,</sentence><sentence id="290">looking at you, you don't look like you believe it either, but it happened.</sentence><sentence id="291">It was one of the things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="292">And it happened not only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, which was the case I was concerned with at that time, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q:Let's stop now.</sentence><sentence id="332">We have to change the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="337">0 TAPE #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q:Bill, You gave us an example of what would make you be skeptical.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A:Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q:What caused you not to become skeptical?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A:Well, being skeptical we looked around and we finally got a hold of other witnesses and interrogated them and found out that some of them had witnessed this same event that I just described to you.</sentence><sentence id="348">And I interrogated those witnesses very, very closely and very, very carefully to find out as many details as each of them could recall.</sentence><sentence id="349">And low and behold the details that these other witnesses gave me dove-tailed very closely with the incident that I just recited to you.</sentence><sentence id="350">And because they dove-tailed so closely and because of this corroboration, and I knew that these witnesses had not had a chance to get together and make up the story among themselves, that that event had to have happened.</sentence><sentence id="351">It had to have happened because two people couldn't have imagined the same type of misconduct.</sentence><sentence id="352">It was so far out, it was so atrocious, so heinous, that the normal individual just couldn't imagine that sort of event taking place.</sentence><sentence id="353">Nevertheless, when somebody from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> gave me that type of story, another witness from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> the same thing, another from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, I began to believe.</sentence><sentence id="354">And finally I got to the point where I could believe most anything because it all did happen.</sentence><sentence id="355">That was the thing that made a believer out of me.</sentence><sentence id="356">But it pointed up a problem that I was confronted with.</sentence><sentence id="357">What <span class="BUILDING">court</span> now is going to hear these witnesses for the first time with such</sentence><sentence id="359">1 a horrible event.</sentence><sentence id="360">Who's going to believe that?</sentence><sentence id="361">You didn't.</sentence><sentence id="362">And it's only natural that the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> wouldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="363">So what we had to do was to sort of condition the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in this sense that I first introduced evidence of events that you would expect to have occurred in a penal environment.</sentence><sentence id="364">Slapping around.</sentence><sentence id="365">Little more force; knocking around.</sentence><sentence id="366">Down to beatings.</sentence><sentence id="367">In that various degrees.</sentence><sentence id="368">And in that way it conditioned the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> for the bizarre events that I just described to you.</sentence><sentence id="369">And that was a problem that we recognized and was a major problem that served as the subject of our conversations as counsel.</sentence><sentence id="370">And when I say our conversations as counsel, I had assistants that were trained lawyers, wonderful men.</sentence><sentence id="371">And we would get together after each session and discuss among ourselves to what extent we thought we had conditioned the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> so that we could bring on testimony of these bizarre events that took place.</sentence><sentence id="372">And it seemed to work.</sentence><sentence id="373">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in all cases except one found the accused guilty of committing war crimes.</sentence><sentence id="374">And, well, the nature of the sentences that they imposed, they must have believed.</sentence><sentence id="375">We almost hit the jackpot in the Mauthausen case.</sentence><sentence id="376">In that case we had 61 accused in the <span class="DLF">dock</span> that we were trying.</sentence><sentence id="377">And of that 61, all of them were found guilty.</sentence><sentence id="378">58 of them were sentenced to be hanged and three of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.</sentence><sentence id="379">So that was almost the jackpot.</sentence><sentence id="380">If they had all been sentenced to be hanged, that would have been the jackpot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q:Were you looking for the death sentence in most of the cases that you were trying?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A:Well, let me say this: At the time I started to try <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, I had tried literally hundreds of jury cases and bench trials.</sentence><sentence id="926">So the fact that this was a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and I was appearing before them where the fact-finders were in the majority like normally be in a jury, and the judge was a law member, it wasn't anything that was unusual.</sentence><sentence id="927">But the feeling that I had at that time was that I wanted to establish a record that would depict a true picture of what went on.</sentence><sentence id="928">And that these individuals accused over there, while they were essential cogs in the machine that the picture was of, the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that it was essential that each one of them be given an opportunity to do whatever he thought was within his power to acquit himself and any of his confederates, if you please.</sentence><sentence id="929">And I use that term confederates advisedly.</sentence><sentence id="930">But actually I had no qualms of conscience about wanting to hang any one of them.</sentence><sentence id="931">Because I had actually</sentence><sentence id="933">3 convinced myself to the point that I was perfectly willing to put the noose around the neck of each one of them with my own hand and spring the trap with my own hand.</sentence><sentence id="934">I was that convinced of their guilt.</sentence><sentence id="935">And so in mass, it was a mass of guilty individuals that should be put away.</sentence><sentence id="936">And that's the way I felt about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q:Bill, could you describe the atmosphere at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> trials and what that was like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A:Well, let me say this: That the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> had been one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in which operations in support of the war had taken place.</sentence><sentence id="968">True it is, they were making shoes and uniforms for the Wehrmacht.</sentence><sentence id="969">And they had the necessary machinery in there for sewing and mending and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="970">Well, when they decided to have these trials down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, they ripped out all the insides of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I just described so that there was one large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">And it was so large that it was the size of the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which could have been 200-250 feet long and maybe a hundred feet wide.</sentence><sentence id="972">And they made <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for the prosecution and <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for the defendants.</sentence><sentence id="973">And one end of the -- accused in one end of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, another end of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">And at the far end was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dais</span> that was raised about two feet off of the ground.</sentence><sentence id="975">So you had to take really two steps to get up to where you could stand.</sentence><sentence id="976">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, you called it.</sentence><sentence id="977">What we call -- lawyers call <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="978">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">judges" bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">It was his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> actually.</sentence><sentence id="980">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> that went practically the length of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="981">And under which revolving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> were placed.</sentence><sentence id="982">And it would seat up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dais</span> approximately as many as 12 to 13 people.</sentence><sentence id="983">So it was adequate.</sentence><sentence id="984">And being elevated, it was high enough to command respect.</sentence><sentence id="985">That's the whole idea of having the judge on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">And it was a dignified <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="987">American flag was back on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was behind the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> who were seated in front of it.</sentence><sentence id="988">And then in front of them there was the <span class="BUILDING">witness stand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="989">And the <span class="BUILDING">witness stand</span> was a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> sort of like I'm sitting in here now.</sentence><sentence id="990">And that was placed in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="991">And about maybe 15 feet from where the members of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> sat, the</sentence><sentence id="993">5 accused sat either on the left- or the right-hand side of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> wanted.</sentence><sentence id="994">The accused had nothing to say.</sentence><sentence id="995">They occupied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> which were like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> that didn't have the upholstery.</sentence><sentence id="996">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> -- seat of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> folded up.</sentence><sentence id="997">And they sat on -- the accused in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> sat on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>'s left in that case.</sentence><sentence id="998">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> they started out on the left and moved over to the right.</sentence><sentence id="999">I never asked who moved them, but I went in the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> one day and it was that way, so that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1000">And the accused each had their own separate <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1001">And in front of the bank of accused that was seated there were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counsel table</span> for the accused.</sentence><sentence id="1002">And there the lawyers and their assistants sat and took their notes and had their interpreters seated there with them.</sentence><sentence id="1003">And getting back to the interpreters, the language barriers, they were not overcome there like they were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1004">We had no instantaneous translation.</sentence><sentence id="1005">We had -- the trials were conducted in English and in German basically.</sentence><sentence id="1006">So we had an English and German interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Then if a witness, we will, say for example was Polish who spoke a little English and spoke no German, we would have an English-Polish, German-Polish interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="1008">So that the order rather went this way: I as the prosecutor would ask the question in English.</sentence><sentence id="1009">That was then translated by the English-German interpreter into German.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Then the Polish-English interpreter would ask the question to the witness.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Now, if the witness understood any of these languages, he could get sort of a fix on it.</sentence><sentence id="1012">But we kept the language of the witness as the controlling language to this extent that he would then have less time for his reply.</sentence><sentence id="1013">In other words, the interpreter who spoke Polish and German would translate after my English-German interpreter had spoken, translated into Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Then the witness would answer in Polish, and it would come back the same track.</sentence><sentence id="1015">So it was sometimes kind of confusing.</sentence><sentence id="1016">But the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> had the official -- these interpreters that I just described to you were all known as official interpreters.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Then as a prosecutor I had my own interpreter and so did the defense counsel.</sentence><sentence id="1018">So there was a bank of people.</sentence><sentence id="1019">We were never without people.</sentence><sentence id="1020">We always had enough accused for an audience at all</sentence><sentence id="1022">6 times.</sentence><sentence id="1023">But the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seating</span> in that covered enough rows there to seat approximately 250 to 300 attendees.</sentence><sentence id="1024">And as I said, when we started out we had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only at sentencing.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was not sitting, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> finished there activities and our clients came back and visited us.</sentence><sentence id="1026">And the attendees were basically in that only the families of the accused were there but also there were representatives of the different nationals that were involved.</sentence><sentence id="1027">We had no Russian observers.</sentence><sentence id="1028">We had no Polish observers, except the London Poles.</sentence><sentence id="1029">The London Poles sent observers, and they were religious about attending all the trials.</sentence><sentence id="1030">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> finished, then the court reporters all -- the newspaper reporters all came back and flocked in.</sentence><sentence id="1031">And at that time they had been broadcasting these proceedings over the <span class="BUILDING">Munich radio station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1032">And I must say, after they started broadcasting, business did pick up.</sentence><sentence id="1033">We had a lot more attendees that wanted to see what they were hearing.</sentence><sentence id="1034">Because some of it was still incredible to most of them, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="1035">But when they saw the witnesses and heard them testify, they began to believe also.</sentence><sentence id="1036">And the attitude, although I must say it was hard to determine, there never was any raucousness or any boisterous conduct of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="1037">It was always carried out on a dignified <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">But sometimes there would be laughter at some activities that had occurred.</sentence><sentence id="1039">And when some of the interpreters got fouled up, everybody was amused at that.</sentence><sentence id="1040">But there was very little amusement other than that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1117">Q:Did you ever talk to the citizens of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1119">A: Well, in the early cases there was fraternization ban which gradually was relaxed, if you please.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And I talked to some of them.</sentence><sentence id="1121">And some of them I talked to didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1122">Some of them I talked to thought that this was just a put-up job, and we were just trying to really administer victors" justice.</sentence><sentence id="1123">But the broadcast did a lot to allay that.</sentence><sentence id="1124">Because that brought them out.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And</sentence><sentence id="1127">7 then they could see, they could hear with their own ears and see with their own eyes what was transpiring there.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And they could understand the German, which I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1129">I listened to it enough.</sentence><sentence id="1130">I learned "Gaschlopen"" "Gestorben" and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1131">But I could speak very little German.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I could tell when somebody was talking about me and that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="1133">But when these people, particularly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, we had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only in those trials practically every day.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1353">A:Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1354">Well, we got our leads from the war crimes investigating teams.</sentence><sentence id="1355">And recognizing we had to have witnesses that were credible and we had to have witnesses that were knowledgeable.</sentence><sentence id="1356">Those were the two things that were fundamental: Credibility and knowledgeability.</sentence><sentence id="1357">And we would take the information that we got from the war crimes teams and use that as springboards.</sentence><sentence id="1358">And interrogating witnesses, we would go from one witness to another depending upon what sort of impression he would make on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1359">We evaluated that.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And he may have known of an event that had occurred that others who would have more credibility than he had.</sentence><sentence id="1361">So we would look around for that.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And in this search we -- I was allocated a DC-3 in which to collect the witnesses from all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Of course, as you know, the inmates of these four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> came from practically every <span class="NPIP">spot</span> in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And so those were the sites of the witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="1365">Because most of them that had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1366">A lot of them remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camps</span>; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1367">That was a fertile source for acquiring witnesses, also.</sentence><sentence id="1368">But we would get these witnesses in, and they would tell us these stories.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And we would make an evaluation as to their credibility and their knowledgeability.</sentence><sentence id="1370">Best ones we kept.</sentence><sentence id="1371">Of course, we couldn't run on forever.</sentence><sentence id="1372">But we tried to get the best because we would listen to one and he would tell us about somebody else that knew the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And we would try to track him down.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And I'm -- I've got to tell you about a man that assisted us greatly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1375">His name was Kohl, K-o-h-l.

shuttle them back and forth from now on."</sentence><sentence id="1402">We only had about 30 that we had to get out so it wasn't too bad.</sentence><sentence id="1403">But we had that type of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1531">A:Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1532">Credibility involves many things.</sentence><sentence id="1533">The way that you sit in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">witness stand</span>, your demeanor on the <span class="BUILDING">witness stand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1534">How you express yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1535">Even though it may be in a foreign language, the facial expressions that you utilize when you're expressing yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1536">All these things go to the matter of being able to enable the fact-finders to tell where the truth lies.</sentence><sentence id="1537">If you get an individual that's going to be close-mouthed and going to tell you only those facts that advance his interest, you can tell it.</sentence><sentence id="1538">It comes out.</sentence><sentence id="1539">And that's the reason why credibility is a matter for the fact-finder and never a consideration for the appellate authority, or in our case, the appointing and confirming authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1540">Oh, I could tell you a lot about that if you want to talk about Ilse Koch sometime.</sentence><sentence id="1541">But credibility is terribly important.</sentence><sentence id="1542">And it was important because we had bizarre things that we had to get the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to believe.</sentence><sentence id="1543">And if you had had a closed-mouthed individual there talking about, describing event that I previously described to you, nobody is going to believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1544">But if he got up there and said it with the feeling that it was terrible for him to even have to talk about it again, to recall it, it's bound to make an impression so far as a fact-finder is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1545">That's what I mean about credibility.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1759">A:Yes, I would like to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1760">Because Arthur Dietzsh had been persecuted by the Weimar Republic and was persecuted again by Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="1761">So he had spent most of his life in confinement of one <span class="NPIP">form</span> or another.</sentence><sentence id="1762">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> he became the male nurse because he was a man of education that he had educated himself actually.</sentence><sentence id="1763">And as a male nurse he was an assistant to a Sturmbahnfiihrer, I think they call him.</sentence><sentence id="1764">A Major Ding-Schuler, who was Kraut that had some artistic qualities about him.</sentence><sentence id="1765">And he was a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1766">He had M.D. And had specialized in diseases and immunization.</sentence><sentence id="1767">And they put Ding-Schuler in charge of this <span class="DLF">block</span> which they had set aside as a <span class="DLF">hospital block</span> for the purpose of developing some sort of immunization against typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1768">Typhus was the plague that was raging all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1769">I think it started up in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> actually is I think where they had the first cases of typhus, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And as those people spread down south, was sent.</sentence><sentence id="1771">But when the advances forced them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> they spread it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> that were located in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1772">So it was terribly important to get some sort of specific for typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And that was Ding-Schuler's job.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And he selected this male nurse as Arthur Dietzsh as his assistant.</sentence><sentence id="1775">And he educated Dietzsh, who already was educated in other matters.</sentence><sentence id="1776">But he became a very confidante -- much of a confidante of Ding- Schuler's.</sentence><sentence id="1777">And they talked about what was going on in the world.</sentence><sentence id="1778">And how <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was losing the war.</sentence><sentence id="1779">And they each recognized at that time, and this was back in January, February and March of 1945, handwriting was pretty much on the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1780">And Arthur Dietzsh having access to Ding- Schuler, and Yoe-Thomas got himself in the <span class="DLF">typhus block</span> and got access to Ding-Schuler and convinced Ding-Schuler to go along with his scheme.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And that included Arthur Dietzsh</sentence><sentence id="1783">9 as the male nurse.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Because Arthur Dietzsh was a hands-on person in the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1785">And they conceived this plan of taking some of these poor guinea pig prisoners who had been infected with typhus when they were dying, switching their identity with Yoe-Thomas and his friends, those five British-French friends that remained out of the group that came there originally.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And one by one they were able to get rid of them.</sentence><sentence id="1787">They finally got down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yoe- Thomas</span>, and his twin hadn't died yet.</sentence><sentence id="1788">So it was getting close.</sentence><sentence id="1789">And they were asking to have Yoe-Thomas brought to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> for execution.</sentence><sentence id="1790">As a matter of fact, they sent an Unterscharffiihrer, I think was tech sergeant or something, down to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to escort Yoe-Thomas down to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1791">And Ding-Schuler said, "Look, typhus is a pretty contagious disease.</sentence><sentence id="1792">If you want to go in here and pick him out of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, he's yours.</sentence><sentence id="1793">Be my guest."</sentence><sentence id="1794">And the Unterscharffiihrer said he had a wife and some kids at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he would like to avoid that if he could.</sentence><sentence id="1795">And he said -- I mean Dietzsh said, "All right.</sentence><sentence id="1796">I'll kill him.</sentence><sentence id="1797">I'll inject him with the syringe and you can take him out."</sentence><sentence id="1798">Well, they finally had a man who was his double.</sentence><sentence id="1799">He died.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And this is according to Dietzsh, believe it or not, but he died.</sentence><sentence id="1801">And Dietzsh went to this corpse, injected it with hydrogen peroxide of all things.</sentence><sentence id="1802">That gets into the heart and creates an embolism, and death is pretty certain.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And speedy.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And that's what they did.</sentence><sentence id="1805">So they said, "Now you can tell them that he's dead.</sentence><sentence id="1806">And if you want to, you can take the body back."</sentence><sentence id="1807">And they said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="1808">You just assure me that he's dead.</sentence><sentence id="1809">Let me take a look."</sentence><sentence id="1810">He took a look and he didn't know Yoe-Thomas from Adam's house cat.</sentence><sentence id="1811">But he went back and reported he was dead.</sentence><sentence id="1812">Well, that saved Yoe-Thomas" life.</sentence><sentence id="1813">And Thomas wrote out on a slip of paper, "To Whom It May Concern, that this man, Labaro (ph), Arthur Dietzsh has saved my life.</sentence><sentence id="1814">And any consideration that you can give him when he's brought to trial --" because Yoe- Thomas had told him every one of you going to be brought to trial.</sentence><sentence id="1815">All of them.</sentence><sentence id="1816">That's how he had his entree to Ding- Schuler.</sentence><sentence id="1817">And he gave him this slip of paper.</sentence><sentence id="1818">And Arthur Dietzsh saved his life.</sentence><sentence id="1819">But he didn't save it for long in that sense.</sentence><sentence id="1820">He went out the</sentence><sentence id="1822">0 <span class="DLF">back door</span> as a corpse, was turned over to the Russians who picked him up on an exchange of prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1823">And he was then sent back to the Germans on this exchange by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1824">He escaped a second time but not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1825">However, the one thing I want to say about Dietzsh, when he did this, he did it because I think in his heart and soul he knew that this is a man that deserves saving.</sentence><sentence id="1826">They had had a lot of conversations together, Dietzsh and Yoe- Thomas.</sentence><sentence id="1827">And Ding-Schuler and Yoe-Thomas.</sentence><sentence id="1828">So that he had the cooperation -- Dietzsh had the cooperation of his boss.</sentence><sentence id="1829">And Yoe-Thomas was the boss of both Schuler and Arthur Dietzsh.</sentence><sentence id="1830">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that tried Dietzsh gave him ten years.</sentence><sentence id="1831">And I think the reviewing authority cut it down to time that he had spent in <span class="INT_SPACE">confinement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">Ding-Schuler took his own life when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> fell.</sentence><sentence id="1833">Ding-Schuler committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1834">So I think that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ding-Schuler</span> is a little different from the ilk that ran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1835">He was able to be persuaded by Yoe- Thomas.</sentence><sentence id="1836">Now, that didn't happen very frequently.</sentence><sentence id="1837">Because there were a lot of others that had tried substantially the same approach that were not successful.</sentence><sentence id="1838">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> we had some other interesting characters one of whom was Ilse Koch, who was the wife of a former commandant.</sentence><sentence id="1839">She was not the wife of a commandant that was there when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> failed.</sentence><sentence id="1840">Pista (ph) was the man on trial.</sentence><sentence id="1841">And Pista couldn't stand Ilse Koch because she still was the commandeur, according to her, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1842">And they were somewhat at odds.</sentence><sentence id="1843">Well, Ilse Koch had a fancy for light shades.</sentence><sentence id="1844">I didn't try her for that.</sentence><sentence id="1845">I tried her for aiding and abetting the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1846">She, during the time of her husband, when he was commandant, used to report prisoners because they ogled her.</sentence><sentence id="1847">I think that's the way you pronounce it when you make big eyes at tight-fitting clothes on a very voluptuous body.</sentence><sentence id="1848">And whenever prisoners ogled Ilse, she took down their numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1849">They were reported and they were whipped.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And they were whipped in a way which was absolutely inhuman.</sentence><sentence id="1851">They were spread across a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> with hands out in front of them and legs down.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And they had to count in German each blow that was administered.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And when they were directed to</sentence><sentence id="1855">1 receive 25 blows, they had to count them out loud.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And they had to count each blow in German.</sentence><sentence id="1857">Well, some of those Poles couldn't speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And some of the Frenchmen couldn't speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And many times those beatings led to death.</sentence><sentence id="1860">So she did have her share of participation in the operation of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in furthering the operation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the extent that there was this common design to subject these prisoners to that type of punishment and that type of misconduct of starvation.</sentence><sentence id="1861">All that sort of thing were things that were charged in the charge sheet.</sentence><sentence id="1862">So she was guilty of aiding and abetting the operation of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1863">Once she had been found guilty, she was given a life sentence.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And the only reason why I later found out from a member of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that they didn't hang her was that she was carrying a child.</sentence><sentence id="1865">She was four months pregnant at the time she was sentenced.</sentence><sentence id="1866">Well, when the reviewing authority cut her sentence down from life imprisonment to four years, they gave as an excuse that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity.</sentence><sentence id="1867">Well, remember, credibility is for the fact-finder, not for the man who is reviewing the case.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Because the man who sees that witness testify and observes the demeanor on the stand, he knows where the truth is coming from.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Not the man who has the written page in front of him of the record of the trial that the original <span class="BUILDING">court</span> had made.</sentence><sentence id="1870">Well, that produced a flurry when they reduced the sentence.</sentence><sentence id="1871">I objected to it.</sentence><sentence id="1872">And I objected to it on the ground that I had tried four of these cases -- three at that time; that was the fourth case.</sentence><sentence id="1873">And I thought I knew how to try a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> case.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Well, when they said there was insufficient credible evidence, that they were telling me I didn't know what was credible and what wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="1875">So I wrote a letter pointing out these things.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And the Congress of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took over after that.</sentence><sentence id="1877">The committee in the <span class="BUILDING">Senate</span> headed by Homer Ferguson held hearings from September of "48 until Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="1878">And they decided that I was right; that there was sufficient credible evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1879">But since the reviewing authority had said no, four years is all, there's nothing we can do about it.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Well, the things that they did do about it, they turned</sentence><sentence id="1882">2 them over to the German people who tried her for offenses against Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1883">I had not tried her for offenses against Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And they tried her and she was given another life sentence and committed suicide in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1885"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> was full of interesting people.</sentence><sentence id="1886">The accused I'm talking about.</sentence><sentence id="1887">I'm sure there were a lot more interesting people who were also prisoners like Yoe-Thomas and others.</sentence><sentence id="1888">One that I tried was a doctor by the name of Evan Katzenelenbogen.</sentence><sentence id="1889">He was a doctor in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1890">And he sold his services to the prisoners for anything that he can get out of them.</sentence><sentence id="1891">And on occasions he would snatch prisoners out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And they lived in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, and in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> there were five men to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> that was to accommodate one and at most two.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Well, this one time he was in; and this had not happened not just one time but many times.</sentence><sentence id="1894">He would snatch a man off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">top bunk</span> down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, which was about six feet below.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And very frequently the prisoner would die as a result of skull fracture.</sentence><sentence id="1896">That, plus the fact that he was selling his services to the people that he was supposed to protect and take care of, moved us to include him as one of the accused.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2085">Q:You want to continue talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katzenelenbogen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2087">A:Katzenelenbogen was a psychoanalyst.</sentence><sentence id="2088">And he played his trade to the last inch in defense of his own self.</sentence><sentence id="2089">That <span class="BUILDING">court</span> absolutely detested him because of the evidence that had been amassed against him.</sentence><sentence id="2090">And it was very little that he did to defend himself other than still claim American citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Because he had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when he was about 20 or 21 years of age, and was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And had taken citizenship papers and married a daughter of one of the justices on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</sentence><sentence id="2093">They had a child, and the child fell out of an <span class="DLF">apartment window</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and was killed.</sentence><sentence id="2094">And that broke up the family.</sentence><sentence id="2095">He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to -- actually it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2096">It was that section of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire that was in there between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2097">Actually went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span> and opened a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="2098">And the Gestapo got interested in him as an informer.</sentence><sentence id="2099">And he was an informer.</sentence><sentence id="2100">And finally he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2101">And they put him in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="2102">And I told you he was sort of a mean fella.</sentence><sentence id="2103">And he would sell his services rather than perform what he was supposed to do.</sentence><sentence id="2104">And he came on for trial having committed a war crime.</sentence><sentence id="2105">And he more or less made an ass out of himself before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in his responses to the questions that were asked by his defense counsel.</sentence><sentence id="2106">And his defense counsel, I believe, at that time was a man by the name of Wolff (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2107">And Wolf did the best he could to keep <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katzenelenbogen</span> quiet.</sentence><sentence id="2108">Because the more he talked, the worse he got.</sentence><sentence id="2109">And when I had him on cross-examination, of course I did the best I could to let him tell us everything he knew.</sentence><sentence id="2110">And he knew a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2111">As a matter of fact, he said the evidence was such that he could have the then minister of justice in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> sitting in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> for the activities that that minister had performed in the small camp at</sentence><sentence id="2113">5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2114">Well, we let him talk.</sentence><sentence id="2115">And after it was over, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> first called him forward and announced that he had been found guilty.</sentence><sentence id="2116">Well, Katzenelenbogen was asked if he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him.</sentence><sentence id="2117">And he had this deep voice.</sentence><sentence id="2118">He could have been a basso profunda at the <span class="BUILDING">Met</span> With no trouble at all.</sentence><sentence id="2119">He said, "Now that this honorable <span class="BUILDING">court</span> has put the Mark of Cain upon my brow, I have but one wish.</sentence><sentence id="2120">And that is that this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> impose upon me the most serious punishment within its power."</sentence><sentence id="2121">And he nodded like that.</sentence><sentence id="2122">And I thought to myself, Well, bless his heart.</sentence><sentence id="2123">I hope they accommodate him.</sentence><sentence id="2124">Well, there was a flurry behind on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2125">And the president of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> said, "The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> finds pursuant to your plea of not guilty that you are guilty.</sentence><sentence id="2126">And finding of you being guilty chooses to impose upon you a life imprisonment."</sentence><sentence id="2127">So the old scoundrel didn't get hanged at all.</sentence><sentence id="2128">He got off with his life.</sentence><sentence id="2129">And except for his age, he'd be alive today.</sentence><sentence id="2130">But he played it to the last inch.</sentence><sentence id="2131">That <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, I found out, that, they didn't want to please him.</sentence><sentence id="2132">And he had asked for the death sentence, and rather than please him, they gave him life imprisonment instead.</sentence><sentence id="2133">So he was a doctor to the end.</sentence><sentence id="2134">I must say that I get back to reducing sentences.</sentence><sentence id="2135">Clemency is a proper thing to be exercised under proper conditions.</sentence><sentence id="2136">But there was no clemency that Ilse Koch was entitled to.</sentence><sentence id="2137">There was no clemency that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katzenelenbogen</span> was entitled to, in my judgment.</sentence><sentence id="2138">But I didn't have the power to wield that authority.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And the fact that some of these sentences have been reduced, I go back to the feeling that I do not know all the facts and circumstances about their family relationships, whether or not they're the sole supports of families that then existed, who were probably without fault on their part.</sentence><sentence id="2140">So that there could be many considerations that could justify the reduction of sentences.</sentence><sentence id="2141">And in the main, I find no fault with the exercise of clemency when it's denominated clemency.</sentence><sentence id="2142">But I do object like a stuck pig to any time that they start reducing sentences on the grounds of insufficient credible evidence, for the simple reason that the whole operation was incredible in its entirety.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q:When you look at the entire set of trials that were, not just the ones you were participating in, where so many people had harsh sentences, whether it was death or life imprisonment that were severely reduced or they were let go, does that bother you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2210">A:To let go, again, I don't know the circumstances of their letting go.</sentence><sentence id="2211">That's a function of the exercise of clemency.</sentence><sentence id="2212">It's to take into consideration those factors which were no part of my concern.</sentence><sentence id="2213">So that if I knew that a sentence had been reduced in exercise of clemency, I don't quarrel with it.</sentence><sentence id="2214">If it's exercised on the ground of insufficient credible evidence, I scream.</sentence><sentence id="2215">And I scream loud and long, because I know that's wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2216">And I know that's wrong because I know that these events that seem incredible to the person who reads about them happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2226">A:l'm sure that there may very well have been, sure.</sentence><sentence id="2227"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was sickened to find denazified leaders.</sentence><sentence id="2228">While none of these individuals that I tried could hardly make that category, there was a sense of uncertainty in not knowing which way to go.</sentence><sentence id="2229">And I think this: I think the United States government did a magnificent job in its occupation.</sentence><sentence id="2230">I really do.</sentence><sentence id="2231">And I say they're entitled to all credit for that.</sentence><sentence id="2232">And I think while mistakes were made, to err is human, to forgive divine.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2472">A:Mr. Wolf was a criminal prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2473">And he was given charge of what was known as the punishment detail in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2474"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> had accompanying its environment there a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2475">And the floor of that <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> was somewhere between two and 300 feet below the level of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2476">And this man Wolf used to take the punishment company, which was composed primarily of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2477">Because let me say this: There's absolutely no doubt about the fact that these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> - were all used as instruments for the purpose of exterminating the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2478">And you can tell that, because the Jews received the harshest work assignments.</sentence><sentence id="2479">They received the smallest amount of food.</sentence><sentence id="2480">And all the dirty, hard work that had to be accomplished was given to the Jewish prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2481">And whenever anybody had something mean that had to be done, and I mean mean, that one prisoner fighting another, they would get one Jew and put him to do that task.</sentence><sentence id="2482">And I'll say this: That there was absolutely no doubt that any Jew that was able to survive those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the Lord has blessed him more and more than anyone will ever know.</sentence><sentence id="2483">Because they were objects of extermination of the system that they had there.</sentence><sentence id="2484">Well, Wolf had this punishment company which was composed primarily of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2485">And one of the things they had to do was to carry a stone which weighed approximately 25 kilos - that's about 55 pounds - from the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> up to the top at the end of the day.</sentence><sentence id="2486">And what else happened at end of the day, that Kapo selected one prisoner out of that group that received and had the opportunity to make the parachute jump without a parachute.</sentence><sentence id="2487">The other prisoners there would select the prisoner that had been picked out by Wolf, take his hands and his feet.</sentence><sentence id="2488">One for the money, two for the show, three to make merry, and over you go.</sentence><sentence id="2489">And they would</sentence><sentence id="2491">2 throw him down and he would crash down to the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2492">It didn't happen every day.</sentence><sentence id="2493">It didn't happen every day, because there was more pressure put on these people because they didn't know which day it was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="2494">But no one of them knew whether or not he was going to be the next person to go one for the money, two for the show.</sentence><sentence id="2495">And they also had <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around the rim of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2496">And they would use those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">catapults</span>, and put a prisoner on there, bend it down, release it then he would be tossed out down to his death in the bottom of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2497">Well, spots -- Wolf was the commanding officer of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2498">Now -- I mean of this detail.</sentence><sentence id="2499">And he made that selection.</sentence><sentence id="2500">Now, how many he selected there, I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="2501">Nobody will ever know because it didn't happen every day.</sentence><sentence id="2502">But it happened so frequently that there was always that sense of urgency when you woke up in the morning as a member of that punishment detail as to whether or not you were going to make the parachute jump.</sentence><sentence id="2503">So Wolf was an individual that I think if anybody exercised clemency on his behalf they should be shot in the head and bled in the of the foot.</sentence><sentence id="2504">Because he certainly wasn't entitled to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2540">Q:Did you prosecute a number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kapos</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2542">A:Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2543">We had the Kapos from the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2544">We had capos that had various work details that would -- one of them used to kill at a detail that was to take prisoners to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2545">I mean, angels of mercy.</sentence><sentence id="2546">And he was the Kapo in charge of this detail.</sentence><sentence id="2547">And he would throttle them with his bare hands.</sentence><sentence id="2548">So that the Kapos were hated by the prisoners who wore the red triangles.</sentence><sentence id="2549">And the Kapos usually were what was known as the block eldest.</sentence><sentence id="2550">Prisoner who was the oldest prisoner in the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2551">They always got the benefit at the time that they had been in the <span class="BUILDING">penitentiary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2552">So they were the oldest prisoner in the <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2553">Not old in years, in age, but the oldest prisoner wise.</sentence><sentence id="2554">And they were hated and they hated each other.</sentence><sentence id="2555">They were</sentence><sentence id="2557">3 hate from the crown of their heads to the sole of their feet.</sentence><sentence id="2558">And we had the Kapo from the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2559">We had this Arthur Dietzsh, who was not a Kapo in the -- he was a male nurse.</sentence><sentence id="2560">We put that moniker on him for a purpose.</sentence><sentence id="2561">We didn't want Dietzsh tainted with being a Kapo.</sentence><sentence id="2562">But he was a male Kapo actually.</sentence><sentence id="2563">But that was the consideration that we were terribly hopeful that the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> would give to Dietzsh; that he was not just a Kapo, but he was a man who was a real man in his heart and soul.</sentence><sentence id="2564">There were few Kapos that had a heart.</sentence><sentence id="2565">Most of them had souls, but they were not entitled to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2592">Q:Well, after all of this, the trials that you were working on, did it change you in some way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2594">A:Physically, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2595">Mentally maybe.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Spiritually I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="2597">And if you ask me to define what happened in each one of the three I tell you I couldn't possibly do it.</sentence><sentence id="2598">Except the physical part.</sentence><sentence id="2599">I was a physical wreck when I finished.</sentence><sentence id="2600">But I got an understanding of people under peculiar circumstances and their reactions that I could never have learned about elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And hopefully I never will have to learn about.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Man's inhumanity to man is something that had no bounds in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2612">Q:Did it make you pessimistic?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2614">A:To some extent.</sentence><sentence id="2615">To some extent, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2616">I can look over my shoulder at things, see who's following me.</sentence><sentence id="2617">But I didn't do it then.</sentence><sentence id="2618">I wasn't looking over my shoulders at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2619">When you asked about security a moment ago, I shouldn't belittle the protection.</sentence><sentence id="2620">Because there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there was a guard at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and there was a guard at every <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2621">And they -- that didn't stop anybody crawling over.</sentence><sentence id="2622">But we had protection.</sentence><sentence id="2623">And I shouldn't belittle that.</sentence><sentence id="2624">I'm sorry if I left that impression.</sentence><sentence id="2625">And I'm not going back on everything else I said, either.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2645">Q:What gives you the most pride in what you did?</sentence><sentence id="2646">Are you proud?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2649">A: Well, pride.</sentence><sentence id="2650">Pride goeth before destruction.</sentence><sentence id="2651">But now that we got that out of the way.</sentence><sentence id="2652">I took no pride in the fact that I had prosecuted 177 people in these trials.</sentence><sentence id="2653">And I took no pride in the fact that a lot of them were hanged and others received severe punishments of imprisonment.</sentence><sentence id="2654">The one thing that we got to remember is that these things came into being because there was a total disregard of human rights, and their protection.</sentence><sentence id="2655">As has been said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenbiirg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> were all dungeons of democracy and so was the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2656">But the thing that I -- that really creates a sense of pride in my heart and feelings is when one of these true survivors of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the Holocaust comes up to me and says, "We thank you for what you've done for us."</sentence><sentence id="2657">That I'm proud of.</sentence></p></dialogue>
