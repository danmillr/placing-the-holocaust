<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="946">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="947">Well, I'll tell you.</sentence><sentence id="948">One of the girls in the <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span> -- and I saw her when I was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> last year, she was a very pretty girl and she had been engaged -- she'd been on the island of Crete and she had been engaged to a non-Jewish man who had been very much into politics and he was anti this, that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="949">And I think he was killed.</sentence><sentence id="950">But she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> and she was one of the girls at the <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">She'd lost all her family and everything.</sentence><sentence id="952">Her name was Eka.</sentence><sentence id="953">Well, Eka -- oh, I have to interrupt.</sentence><sentence id="954">At the <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span> -- before the war, Greek girls and particularly girls of good families never worked, all they did was learn how to do housework, cook, embroidery and that was it until they got married.</sentence><sentence id="955">So that these girls came back and they didn't work, they had no professions.</sentence><sentence id="956">So this was a part of what was done for them by Joint, through the National Council of Jewish Women, and what's the other organiza -- ORT, yes.</sentence><sentence id="957">And ORT sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span>, and so the girls at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were learning to sew and do dressmaking and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="958">Well, Eka learned to sew very well.</sentence><sentence id="959">And they decided that she had a flair and that she should go to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and learn haute couture.</sentence><sentence id="960">So,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="963">3 in order to get Eka to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was about six months work.</sentence><sentence id="964">And I would go to her the -- to the police because somebody who knew her ex-fiance had told about her, that she must have been a radical.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="965">And so the -- the passport people wouldn't give her a passport, they wouldn't give her any permission to leave.</sentence><sentence id="966">And I would have to go to -- she had to have a representative from the Joint to go with her to all these interviews and police things, and so I used to go with her.</sentence><sentence id="967">And finally she did get the visa and she did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and she did learn haute couture.</sentence><sentence id="968">And when she came back, she started a little business on her own, which was a wonderful thing.</sentence><sentence id="969">And I'm trying to think what else they did.</sentence><sentence id="970">Course many of the girls at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were adopted by people in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, and so they were able to emigrate and lots of them came over.</sentence><sentence id="971">And this one girl I told you about, she's a cousin of Matsas, Nina.</sentence><sentence id="972">Nina had a sister, they were both in the <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="973">The sister was younger than Nina and she was adopted by a family in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">And so Esther came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> where she married and had a wonderful family, four lovely children, and Nina eventually came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, but she didn't like it so she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where some of her other former <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span> girls had gone.</sentence><sentence id="975">And so they had a little sort of clubby kind of relationship.</sentence><sentence id="976">Nina eventually married and her husband knew people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and they said, why are you staying up there?</sentence><sentence id="977">Why don't you come down here and we'll set you up ina <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>?</sentence><sentence id="978">He knew catering because he'd been <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">catering ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">So Nina and this husband came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and I don't know if you ever went there, but there was a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span> called <span class="BUILDING">The Diplomat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="980">It was on <span class="DLF">Wisconsin Avenue</span>, it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="981">And then they finally retired, and they sold the <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="982">Her husband died at the beginning of this year, and anyhow, I spoke to Nina and I said, Nina, would you be willing to be interviewed if they think that you would have a good story?</sentence><sentence id="983">She said of course.</sentence><sentence id="984">So anyhow --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="985">Q: Did you -- when you met
