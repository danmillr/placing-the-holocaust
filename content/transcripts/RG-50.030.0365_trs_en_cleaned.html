<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and when we came to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>, on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were in no-man's land for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and let us into a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">The name is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> because it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and here we were about 2,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="90">So we organized.</sentence><sentence id="91">I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> which were empty.</sentence><sentence id="92">So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="99">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> until six weeks before the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="100">In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> because it was just about six weeks before the war started.</sentence><sentence id="101">Then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, I stayed until I think it was September 1940.</sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> had already been closed the first of May.</sentence><sentence id="104">So, one evening a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, because I had corresponded with my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, so she knows where I was.</sentence><sentence id="105">And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to pick me up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and took me into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to be reunited with my sister and father.</sentence><sentence id="106">I was not too long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski," an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview.</sentence><sentence id="107">And there he said, "I want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because we have to give them work."</sentence><sentence id="108">For work we will get bread and we can live.</sentence><sentence id="109">So we registered --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Let me ask you something.</sentence><sentence id="122">You're how old at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: At that time I was 24 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.534806" long="10.748806">Dora</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What was she doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowski.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: Did you know this when you were writing to her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="138">I knew it only when I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position.</sentence><sentence id="144">She was able to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Did it worry you when these people came to the <span class="DLF">door</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: At first, yes, at first.</sentence><sentence id="150">But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for, naturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and tell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski was in a position to deal with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettoverwaltung</span>,* to tell them you give us material.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="156">We will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="157">&gt; Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the Judenrat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">* "Ghetto Administration" which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="160">When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: You remember the <span class="BUILDING">Maccabees</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you explain what that <span class="BUILDING">organization</span> was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, and we decided to make sabotage.</sentence><sentence id="170">We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, any transport of the SS people and stuff like this.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, we really gave them a hard time.</sentence><sentence id="172">And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go.</sentence><sentence id="173">That was in 1936.</sentence><sentence id="174">Then in "38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: So, when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and at least some violence against the Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Absolutely, yes.</sentence><sentence id="184">When I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and naturally I was right up in arms.</sentence><sentence id="185">I could not digest it that easily.</sentence><sentence id="186">And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, in 1942, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived.</sentence><sentence id="187">And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> became a model for all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in the other <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">So, three days and three nights we registered all the people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: How did you do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Well, I got a staff and I got an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and people came day and night.</sentence><sentence id="198">There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days and three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">So we delegated people directly into the various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by yourself at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: At that point, yes, I organized it myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt they could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: So how many people were on your staff at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: At that time I couldn't tell you exactly.</sentence><sentence id="210">It was over 20.</sentence><sentence id="211">Between 20 and 30 people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards.</sentence><sentence id="218">But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and with this they were given i.d.</sentence><sentence id="219">cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food.</sentence><sentence id="220">And this entitled them to a soup.</sentence><sentence id="221">There were various soups around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where the people who worked the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> were able to get a soup.</sentence><sentence id="222">Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="223">And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and delegated him to a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> while I took a healthy- looking guy from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and put him into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand.</sentence><sentence id="225">The ones who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, they were sitting.</sentence><sentence id="226">They got a little bit more to eat than the others.</sentence><sentence id="227">So, this went on, then, until 1944 --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Now you're moving too fast.</sentence><sentence id="240">When you're registering people, there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: They still got cards.</sentence><sentence id="244">They still were registered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: And did they go with family members to certain <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or would they stay in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work.</sentence><sentence id="250">They were unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without i.d.cards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes, everybody had to be registered.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: And when you came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and you're registering there are almost 200,000 people, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: What is happening with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> at this point?</sentence><sentence id="261">When you came in was everybody living where they're supposed to be living or are they moving around?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Well, they had since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed the first of May.</sentence><sentence id="265">Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had to be housed.</sentence><sentence id="266">So, naturally, there wasn't enough <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> available for every family.</sentence><sentence id="267">So you found in most cases that in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> lived four families.</sentence><sentence id="268">In every <span class="NPIP">corner</span> a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water.</sentence><sentence id="269">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">People didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">They would have to go to <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it up into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: And were there a number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pumps</span> in different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: No, mostly in every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and not every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had running water.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="288">Q: Were you living with your father and your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Yes, in the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: I gather that your father's second wife and child had left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: No, she had left in 1939 to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: She didn't get any papers for him.</sentence><sentence id="301">She got papers just for herself and her son, and father was very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> also being a custom tailor.</sentence><sentence id="302">He was always working and had also quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">He had to make their suits for them, right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going to their particular <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or <span class="BUILDING">work places</span>, what is then your job?</sentence><sentence id="305">What are your responsibilities once that happened?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Well --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What would be a day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: They were always going movements on.</sentence><sentence id="311">People had died from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="312">They had to be replaced.</sentence><sentence id="313">OK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so many people and so many various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, so there was always something going on where the department of labor had to act accordingly, right.</sentence><sentence id="314">So, there was always something going on that kept us busy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Not regularly but often.</sentence><sentence id="323">He came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> or I was called upon for meetings.</sentence><sentence id="324">And -- oh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: What was your relationship like?</sentence><sentence id="329">What kinds of things would you discuss?</sentence><sentence id="330">Would it only be business or were you also discussing the situation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit about various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more details about.</sentence><sentence id="335">And also, about my background, what he wanted to know.</sentence><sentence id="336">But otherwise, he was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had concerts.</sentence><sentence id="337">We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by itself in itself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Was this a hard job for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1244">Q: Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski?</sentence><sentence id="1245">Was he easy to work with or difficult to work with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1248">A: We knew it was difficult to work for him.</sentence><sentence id="1249">She didn't have to answer that because everybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took everything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him.</sentence><sentence id="1250">He was demanding.</sentence><sentence id="1251">He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

time.</sentence><sentence id="1466">So, that was the last few days.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And I had my violin.</sentence><sentence id="1468">That's all I took.</sentence><sentence id="1469">Of course I had a few hidden items there.</sentence><sentence id="1470">And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said "Let's not go out because they're still shooting."</sentence><sentence id="1471">And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1472">I warned people, "Don't overeat, take it easy," and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up.</sentence><sentence id="1473">And I went with father and we went across a <span

id="1489">And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything.</sentence><sentence id="1490">I had to help him.</sentence><sentence id="1491">I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to

came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and I started working right away in the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> and registered all the people who were coming from the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I repatriated people like Poles to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various passes to the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border towns</span> and I left them there and I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> back <span
