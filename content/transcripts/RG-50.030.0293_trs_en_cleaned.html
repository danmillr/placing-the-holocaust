<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Oh sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, my name is, my real name is Estella Rubinlicht and I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that became very infamous because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that we had next door my --------.</sentence><sentence id="18">| was born to a nice Jewish family, traditional, observant.</sentence><sentence id="19">Both of my parents were professional people which was a little unusual for the circumstances of Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="20">My mother was a dentist who put herself through <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, while my father was a court-appointed interpreter in three languages, and I also had a little brother, who was seven years younger than I was.</sentence><sentence id="21">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> had about 140,000 to 150,000 inhabitants.</sentence><sentence id="22">We had a very famous <span class="BUILDING">yeshiva</span>, and also I would say that about 60,000 out of the population have been Jews.</sentence><sentence id="23">Before the war, I was little but we kind of enjoyed normal life for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="24">We were allowed to practically do everything, except Jews couldn't hold any government jobs, and also going into the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was very complicated being a Jew -- there was a special quota for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="25">But I happened to attend <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span>, both <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> both private, because simply there was a better education my parents could afford.</sentence><sentence id="26"><span class="BUILDING">Public school</span> was compulsory but <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was not available to all the population.</sentence><sentence id="27">I had a very happy childhood, very close-knit family, lots of love, two sets of grandparents, not too big of a family, we were not a very large family; but kind of well-to-do, not extravagant, and very happy.</sentence><sentence id="28">I had a happy childhood until when I was twelve years old the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="29">The rumor started in 1939 in the summer when we as teenagers were going to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and doing all kinds of summer things, and the rumor started that there was going to be a war.</sentence><sentence id="30">My father at dinnertime -- we always had dinner together, that was the family thing to do -- told us that we had to be prepared ---------- -- and maybe we should accumulate some more food, because for a certain time things are going to be going on that are going to be bad.</sentence><sentence id="31">Nobody ever expected what is going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="32">People thought that maybe there would be a war that would blow over, and that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="33">I mean, in the history of the world never anything like that happened.</sentence><sentence id="34">So the Jews were quite sedate.</sentence><sentence id="35">They kind of thought, you know, that whatever happens, just happens.</sentence><sentence id="36">And it wasn't until suddenly on the first of September, 1939, that we woke up to severe bombing and not being prepared and of knowing what it is really, we all went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and stayed there while the raid was over.</sentence><sentence id="37">When we came out, there was a realization that we had war and that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">Well, there was panic, we didn't know what to do, and people were completely at the stage of panic, they didn't know what to expect.</sentence><sentence id="39">Well, this state of affairs did not take too long, because after four days the Polish government went away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the next day on the fifth day of this disarray, the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="40">Now, all I saw was these mad Germans running around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and running into <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and just grabbing everything they could.</sentence><sentence id="41">So into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a group of Germans came in, tore the watch and everything they could off my mother's hands, grabbed all the things we had, took whatever they wanted to, broke china, beat us up, and went out.</sentence><sentence id="42">That was my first encounter with what the Germans are really like.</sentence><sentence id="43">Then they were running around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they decided that they want men, so they gave an order that so-and-so many men have to come to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and of course we were very worried.</sentence><sentence id="44">A lot of people at that time, as I recall, were running away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, east, and we even had an opportunity, our family to go.</sentence><sentence id="45">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that our neighbor owned and he wanted all of us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">But you know, my mother was a homemaker, she had her livelihood there, they just couldn't part with things, they didn't know how to go to the unknown.</sentence><sentence id="47">And so, placidly, most of the Jewish population stayed.</sentence><sentence id="48">Some of them did go east, but my family decided to stay.</sentence><sentence id="49">Well, the next -- it was 1939, of course <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed, the Germans were riding around, there was a curfew after seven and we were right away given yellow our stars saying "Jude," that means Jew, we had to wear one on the left shoulder in front and one in the back so they could see us from the back and front.</sentence><sentence id="50">And we were living under curfew with very little food, not knowing what's going to happen next.</sentence><sentence id="51">Now, what happened in the period between 1939 and 1942 was the fact that the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller and smaller because through different actions of taking people away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> the Germans would round up a certain area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, take out the Jews, beat them up, and ship them some <span class="NPIP">place</span> off.</sentence><sentence id="52">We did not know what happened to these people, what happened to the families, because we had no contact with newspapers, radios, everything was taken away from us.</sentence><sentence id="53">So we merely existed, not in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="54">As the Jewish population was getting smaller and smaller, the Germans have been giving the Jews smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> to live, and because they wanted them all together, they were forming what wasn't even a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet but an <span class="REGION">area</span> that was dedicated for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="55">And they would put, like, four or five families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so that when they need to take them out, it would be easier for them to have them all together.</sentence><sentence id="56">Well, we lived through many of those actions, and fortunately both of my parents were working -- working so that the Germans needed them; therefore, we were spared at the beginning, because my mother as a dentist was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the Germans needed care.</sentence><sentence id="57">Now, my father also had a job, in the administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so they also needed him.</sentence><sentence id="58">But as I was already 14 years old, I needed a job on my own in order to be spared.</sentence><sentence id="59">So I got a little job in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> helping out.</sentence><sentence id="60">And that's how through all these actions we were able to somehow survive.</sentence><sentence id="61">Food was scarce.</sentence><sentence id="62">My mother was getting a little bit of food from peasants who were coming still to her for medical advice, and so we survived until April 1942.</sentence><sentence id="63">By April 1942 was one of those big actions where they took away a lot of Jewish people, and out of 60,000 only 4,000 survived.</sentence><sentence id="64">We were given special passes, special Reich documents like passports, and these were the 4,000 Jews that actually were working for the Germans and that the Germans decided to keep for a little bit longer.</sentence><sentence id="65">We still did not know where all the people went.</sentence><sentence id="66">Well, the state of living was just terrible, you know -- Germans were coming in, cutting off the beards of the Jewish people, they were beating them up, they were taking them out haphazardly, they were demanding things, soldiers were running around and taking advantage of women, they plundered.</sentence><sentence id="67">There was practically nothing any more because we had lived in a little tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> where they put these 4,000 people to live; very inhumanly, in little <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span>, in little <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where very poor peasants lived -- they had to be evacuated and they were given <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that the Jews lived in.</sentence><sentence id="68">You could see a horse and a cow on the third floor <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> because these people took all their belongings with them; we were put in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where these people lived before.</sentence><sentence id="69">There they put a <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and called it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but not in the idea of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, this was a settlement of Jews which were surrounded by barbed wire and constantly watched so there was no way out.</sentence><sentence id="71">The people that watched, the soldiers that watched the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were mostly Lithuanians and Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="72">They were helping the Germans to keep order because the Germans could not be bothered with these little things like watching the Jews, they wanted them when they needed them.</sentence><sentence id="73">And in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they were coming in like four in the morning wearing white gloves, dressed to kill as clean as they always were, and beat up the Jews and taking them out again.</sentence><sentence id="74">That state of affairs lasted from April "42 until November "42.</sentence><sentence id="75">I was still with my parents and I was still with my brother.</sentence><sentence id="76">In that little <span class="NPIP">place</span> we still managed to go out a little bit because we were young, and that's when I met my present husband.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Now, to back up a little bit, were there many children like your brother, your little brother, or how did you manage to keep him hidden with you?</sentence><sentence id="140">You had to work --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: OK.</sentence><sentence id="144">At the times I just described, I was still with my parents, so we were still together, and we still had some means to buy some food on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">So my brother was my responsibility, because up until that moment I was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents cared for me.</sentence><sentence id="146">I even managed to go out for ice cream, not late in the evening, but we had a little <span class="DLF">garden</span> next to the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived and the Germans made sure that the Jews tilled the soil and grew some flowers because they had to show to the International Red Cross how nice the Jews had it in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">And every morning at six o'clock we would be taken out through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> to work and taken to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">And every day at six o'clock, they would bring us back, and then there was curfew.</sentence><sentence id="149">So that was the life that summer.</sentence><sentence id="150">Now, not far away from this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, -------- [name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp] and</span> we saw the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> working on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> wearing these uniforms, and that's all we saw.</sentence><sentence id="151">We knew that there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there, and we saw the people, emaciated in these striped uniforms, showing us -- like this -- that they are hungry.</sentence><sentence id="152">But we were always in groups watched by the Germans and we were not allowed to have any contact with these people, they were digging <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">And we knew that something is going on there, something very, very bad, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was not far away.</sentence><sentence id="154">In fact, our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called -------- and the big concentration was called -------- [both names].</sentence><sentence id="155">So there was a little bit interconnected this whole <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">There was an incident where friend of my present husband had a sandwich, and so this Jew asked him for food and asked the guard -- whoever he was, I don't know if it was a German or Lithuanian -- if he may give him the sandwich, the guard said "yes" and as soon as he gave him the sandwich he shot him, he shot this friend of my husband.</sentence><sentence id="157">So there was the situation.</sentence><sentence id="158">I still was with my parents, I'm stretching it all the time because it really was the last time I was with my parents in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">And having a very sheltered life and having a good home life, I really never thought was life is all about and how to go about managing it on my own.</sentence><sentence id="160">We didn't grow up as fast over there as children grow up today, and being 14, 15, really meant to be under the care of your parents all the time, especially when there were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> -- I was completely cut off from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for three years already.</sentence><sentence id="161">It wasn't until November 1942 that the tragedy happened.</sentence><sentence id="162">One early morning -- (she takes deep breath) I have to admit and Ihave to tell you there was no way to escape at that time.</sentence><sentence id="163">Even if we would like to stay outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there was no way to do anything, there was no people that would take us in.</sentence><sentence id="164">They were hunting Jews all over.</sentence><sentence id="165">We had no papers, we could not get a job, we could not get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, we really couldn't go out and stay on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="167">They would find you sooner or later.</sentence><sentence id="168">It wouldn't be the Germans, it would be the Poles that were the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="169">But that was happening all the time.</sentence><sentence id="170">So it was on the morning in 1942 in November -- I don't know if it was the 6th or the 7th of November that we were woken up at three in the morning that we were told that everybody has to come to this big square because we cannot stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="171">And we kind of had a feeling that this is the end of this little settlement of the Jews, because we heard rumors that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish villages</span> and settlements had stopped existing all around in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">So we knew that if we come to this square, they will take us away forever.</sentence><sentence id="173">What happened was that my father arranged for my mother to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and stay there, thinking that maybe the Germans will honor the doctors still there, like they did before.</sentence><sentence id="174">Some people had little hidings in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> but we didn't have any, but my husband's parents had a little hiding spot in their little <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which was really a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> where you could stand like lined up in a queue if it were necessary, but not for too long.</sentence><sentence id="175">Well, my present husband, who was at that time just a friend, came over running to our little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he said, "Why don't they take her," meaning me, "to my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>?</sentence><sentence id="176">Because she doesn't really have such good papers and they probably will take her away.</sentence><sentence id="177">And we have this little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, so me and my family are going in there."</sentence><sentence id="178">And we didn't even have time to think, I didn't have time to say goodbye to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="179">My father said, "Go, Honey, it's the best thing for you to go."</sentence><sentence id="180">And I just went with him, and he said, "I am going to try to take care of my brother and see what we can do."</sentence><sentence id="181">And there was a -- I never saw my parents again.</sentence><sentence id="182">And so we went in to the hiding with my present husband, and we stayed in this little <span class="NPIP">wall hiding place</span> probably between six in the morning up until maybe two in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="183">We tried not to cough, we tried not to move.</sentence><sentence id="184">And then at two o'clock somebody knocked and said, "You might as well come out, this is the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">You will not survive here, there is no food, there going to come and raze all those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">There are proclamations all over on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, this is the end of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that all the Jews have to come to a certain <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek Concentration Camp</span>, because this is the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="187">Well, my first thought was to go back to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and see if anybody is there but we weren't allowed to move any more, we could only allowed to go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, that's all.</sentence><sentence id="188">There were Germans in this ------- and they were showing you how to get to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and there was no other choice but to go there.</sentence><sentence id="189">My husband's parents said, "You are so young" -- he also had a sister -- "it's too bad, maybe you try to run away through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and maybe you can squeeze, at least the two of you to survive."</sentence><sentence id="190">So we tried, it was bright daylight and we tried to -------- at one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, and to run.</sentence><sentence id="191">Well, I have to tell you that around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was nothing, which is plain <span class="DLF">fields</span>, for miles and miles to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it wasn't like you could run into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or something, there was nothing there.</sentence><sentence id="192">Well, we ran for about a little mile to a ------ and there was shooting but they didn't hurt us, but then finally one of those guards ran after us, beat my husband up -- he still has a permanent scar in his eye, no vision, and called us all kinds of names and told us "back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you go."</sentence><sentence id="193">So that was not successful.</sentence><sentence id="194">When we came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I could not see my mother any more because my mother was already taken.</sentence><sentence id="195">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the doctors, the staff, and all the people that were in there, I mean the patients, they were all taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so my mother was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>, poor thing.</sentence><sentence id="196">I saw my father, who was still around, and I saw my brother.</sentence><sentence id="197">And my husband's parents were still with us and we were thinking -- we had three days to go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">Well, we were making quick decisions, we didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="199">We could not go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for any money or clothes or anything.</sentence><sentence id="200">My husband's parents, unfortunately, decided that they will go to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and so did his sister.</sentence><sentence id="201">She really did not want to live any more.</sentence><sentence id="202">We were so broken up, we had no will to survive.</sentence><sentence id="203">We went through three years of dehumanization, deprivation, hunger and everything, and you know what ------------------- maybe.</sentence><sentence id="204">Moreover, ---------going on like that.</sentence><sentence id="205">But my father said to us, I "really want somebody to provide for the family."</sentence><sentence id="206">I was thirteen and a half at this point. "</sentence><sentence id="207">We're going to try in the middle of the night when it's dark for young to get through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And maybe you can survive."</sentence><sentence id="209">So we passively said OK and we tried a couple of nights and we couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="210">But then on the third night my father got some gold coins and some watches and some -------- together and said, "I will try to bribe some guard, maybe he will let you go."</sentence><sentence id="211">And on the third morning, about four o'clock -- it was in November, it was very dark, there was snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> -- my father arranged for the guards to look away, gave them all this stuff and said, "I want you to look the other way.</sentence><sentence id="212">I want my family to get out."</sentence><sentence id="213">And so, myself, my present husband, who was just a friend, and my little brother, who was nine years old, were practically pushed by my father through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> to go and survive.</sentence><sentence id="214">I wanted my father to come with.</sentence><sentence id="215">He said, "Oh no, I have to go to my ----- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I have to help your mother.</sentence><sentence id="216">I cannot go with you."</sentence><sentence id="217">He said, "Go, and see what you can do for yourself."</sentence><sentence id="218">And so we did.</sentence><sentence id="219">We had to walk quite a long while because there was nobody around.</sentence><sentence id="220">And they were shooting.</sentence><sentence id="221">But then we saw a peasant, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was very far, maybe ten kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="222">We saw a peasant and we asked him if he would give us a ride.</sentence><sentence id="223">He might have known who we are but he pretended maybe that he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="224">We thought he's either going to kill us all or he's going to take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="225">He took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> it was really bedlam because everybody knew that the --------------- and everybody knew the Jews were running away and everybody was looking for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="226">And if you found a Jew and showed him to a German, you would get ten pounds of sugar or five pounds of flour, something like that, they were posted all over looking for the Jews that are running way from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">So it was impossible in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to really hide overnight.</sentence><sentence id="228">But fortunately my husband knew somebody that worked for my father and we walked in and said, "May we just stay overnight some <span class="NPIP">place</span>" and of course they were scared because you know they would find Jews by them, they would shoot them too.</sentence><sentence id="229">So it wasn't only the point that they didn't want to help, because we knew some very fine people that were patients of my mother, and my mother told me she gave them stuff to hide like candelabra and linens and fur coats; in case we ever needed them they would be outside the <span

overnight."</sentence><sentence id="231">The only person that let us overnight was this worker that used to work for my husband's father, and they put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> full of coal and potatoes and everything that people put down there, and we stayed overnight, the three of us.</sentence><sentence id="232">A very unusual trio.</sentence><sentence id="233">My husband was then 22, I was 16, and a nine-year-old boy.</sentence><sentence id="234">And we -------------.</sentence><sentence id="235">We stayed overnight and we knew we had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="236">So we had no way to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but in the morning I heard that the Germans came in and shot my father, because my father still was in the <span

was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where nobody knew us and we were dreaming and hoping that maybe we could establish our existence as Aryans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">Well, that wasn't so simple because before we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I went into a lady whom my mother gave things to to keep for us.</sentence><sentence id="241">This lady was supposed to be a friend of my mother's and she also lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we did.</sentence><sentence id="242">In the meantime she told me to come back at a different hour and there were two Gestapo people waiting for me, so she wasn't friendly to me.</sentence><sentence id="243">I almost lost my life at that point because they were walking with me and trying to take me to the Gestapo, and then they were calling for some other people -- it's impossible to describe the situation but I ran into a bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where there was a little <span class="DLF">door</span> and in this little <span class="DLF">door</span> was a shoemaker living and the shoemaker knew my husband, and that lady decided to hide me in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of hers.</sentence><sentence id="244">She really was the one that saved my life, because I knew that I cannot hide there, there was nothing there, just one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a curtain.</sentence><sentence id="245">She said, "You stand behind the curtain."</sentence><sentence id="246">My shoes were showing.</sentence><sentence id="247">I said, "I can't jeopardize everybody else."</sentence><sentence id="248">And my brother and my husband were was sitting there in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but they didn't know my family, they just knew me.</sentence><sentence id="249">And somehow she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> real wide and we played the housing scene.</sentence><sentence id="250">As the Germans came up there to look for me, she didn't even let wait until they came in.</sentence><sentence id="251">She came out, dusting off a little rug, and they said to her, "Did you see a Jewish woman running around here?"</sentence><sentence id="252">She said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="253">She was an older, simple lady.</sentence><sentence id="254">She said, "No, I didn't see anybody

as they walked to the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I ran to the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> around the corner.</sentence><sentence id="260">So that was one of my very close encounters.</sentence><sentence id="261">From there we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028"

we had but I had a very good pair of shoes, because every Jew believes that no matter what happens with you, you have to have very good pair of leather shoes in case you have to walk.</sentence><sentence id="264">I also had a coat with a little fur underneath so in case I get stuck some <span class="NPIP">place</span> I should be warm; that's what I had.</sentence><sentence

id="268">We got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> at four o'clock in the morning and they have these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaws</span> that used to take to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, like either horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span>, and as we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> they recognized us right away -- the Poles, not the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="269">See, the Germans per se would not recognize a Jew, they did not know, they were not aware of the characteristics of the Jews -- whether you had a long nose or whether your Polish is not proper or whether you speak with a Jewish accent; they did not know this but the Poles were absolutely acute to this, they were really experts.</sentence><sentence id="270">So they somehow saw -- they were waiting for people to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, they knew that the Jews are running -- and they saw my husband was given by one of his friends a fancy coat with a fancy hat and that is no ----- with us, they really didn't ------ to kill us------------ and right away when we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and tried to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I thought maybe I could find -- I had an address -- some people who would help us out with false papers, or anything.</sentence><sentence id="271">They right away took us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and they were going and going and going.</sentence><sentence id="272">And I said, "Well, we wanted to go to this-and-that <span class="DLF">street</span>."</sentence><sentence id="273">He said, "Oh no, that's not where you're going."</sentence><sentence id="274">I said, "Where are we going?"</sentence><sentence id="275">He said, "You're going to the Gestapo."</sentence><sentence id="276">I said, "Why is that?"</sentence><sentence id="277">He said, "Because you are Soviet Jews and we know you that you're hiding.</sentence><sentence id="278">And because you are Jews, you can't survive, we are taking you straight to the Gestapo."</sentence><sentence id="279">And they were Poles, young Poles, who were riding this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> and we said to them, "Stop!</sentence><sentence id="280">Why would you do that?"</sentence><sentence id="281">He said, "----------, you should get back to the Gestapo." "</sentence><sentence id="282">What do you care whether we live or not?" "</sentence><sentence id="283">No, you have to go."</sentence><sentence id="284">Well, whatever we had on we gave it to them.</sentence><sentence id="285">We stopped in a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> in a little corner of ----- --- <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I told them, "Whatever I have you can take.</sentence><sentence id="286">I still have a little money.</sentence><sentence id="287">You can take my rings, you can take my watch, whatever I have, but please leave us here on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, don't take us."</sentence><sentence id="288">So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="289">They stripped us of everything we had and left us in the corner of that <span class="DLF">street</span> by the <span class="DLF">door</span> of some <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">So here we are, about twelve o'clock in the afternoon with nowhere to go, with nowhere to sleep, with no money.</sentence><sentence id="291">Soon enough we had no choice but to try to find a way to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And we knew that this is suicidal.</sentence><sentence id="293">We realized it but there was no other way for us -- we couldn't practically sleep on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">Talking about homeless people today, you know, we were really homeless.</sentence><sentence id="295">There was just nobody I knew, nobody that I could talk to, but we knew one thing: we knew how to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">It also wasn't easy.</sentence><sentence id="297">You just don't take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> intended for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and say, "I want to go in there."</sentence><sentence id="298">We decided, we knew, that the Jews come out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work every day morning and they go back at night.</sentence><sentence id="299">We knew that they go to work at the certain <span class="BUILDING">depot</span>, <span class="BUILDING">coal depot</span>, where they unload <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> of coal for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="300">And we knew that if we go there and when we talk to the supervisor, who was Jewish, and if he has ------ people going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he will probably do us a favor and take us on.</sentence><sentence id="301">So that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="302">I think it was November 9th or 10th.</sentence><sentence id="303">We just went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ----- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and we found this group of Jews working there.</sentence><sentence id="304">We talked to the fellow.</sentence><sentence id="305">We said, "Look: We are three people, we cannot stay on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>, we have nothing, we want to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">And I had an uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who was my father's brother and I was hoping that at least I could go get a meal there and somebody to talk to.</sentence><sentence id="307">Because we were so tired from running and at this point we wanted to die as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="308">Which later reversed itself, you see.</sentence><sentence id="309">But we were so tired of running, we see the best that all the other Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because we have no parents any more and nobody to take care of us, we're just alone, and whatever happens, happens.</sentence><sentence id="310">So that night we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">I remember that my brother had a little coat and on the coat there was a fur collar.</sentence><sentence id="312">We had to tear off his collar and throw it out the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because Jews were not allowed to have any fur on them.</sentence><sentence id="313">And whatever else we had, like a little suitcase, that had to all be taken away, thrown out, because we were going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as workers.</sentence><sentence id="314">And that's how we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was really not what I remembered from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, whether was <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>, it was summer, we had little flowers in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and there was my mother and father and somebody to protect me.</sentence><sentence id="316">That was a twelve-foot <span class="DLF">wall</span>, with people in there who were emaciated.</sentence><sentence id="317">It was almost the end thing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">It was the "small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>" what they call where people were laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, dead, covered up with newspapers; where there was absolutely no food.</sentence><sentence id="319">On the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> they were selling horsemeat.</sentence><sentence id="320">It was absolutely a tragic picture.</sentence><sentence id="321">And that's what we got into.</sentence><sentence id="322">Unfortunately, we didn't get much help from the family.</sentence><sentence id="323">My family was not responsive to my needs.</sentence><sentence id="324">The only thing they did when we got there, they meant us to ----- marriage.</sentence><sentence id="325">They said, "Are there two of you?"</sentence><sentence id="326">I said, "Yes, we are friends, we knew each other briefly.</sentence><sentence id="327">It just so happens that we care for each other but I just lost my parents, he just lost his parents, I'm 16 years old, just to think of getting married is the last thing in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="328">We want to survive." "</sentence><sentence id="329">Well," my uncle said, "You know that's not right.</sentence><sentence id="330">If you are going to be together you have to get married."</sentence><sentence id="331">I said, "Well, if you want to do it, then arrange for it.</sentence><sentence id="332">Fine with us."</sentence><sentence id="333">Well, my uncle found a rabbi, the rabbi didn't want to marry me, I was too young, but finally there was a rabbi who on a Saturday afternoon, December 13, married us in his little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, wherever he lived there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">They got me some dress -- from a neighbor, I guess, because I didn't have anything, -- and we were married.</sentence><sentence id="335">We were married, then we were given a ------, you know, the Jewish certificate of marriage, which, incidentally later, was flushed down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> because when we became "Aryans," we couldn't have it, there was no document of marriage.</sentence><sentence id="336">And as we got married, my uncle said -- first of all he told us we can't stay with him; he still had a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and quite a bit of money and he said, "No, you can't stay here."</sentence><sentence id="337">So we had to find ourselves a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338">And fortunately I met some people who were from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and knew my parents.</sentence><sentence id="339">As a matter of fact, one lady gave me her ring, her wedding band, to get married with, before the wedding, that we got married with.</sentence><sentence id="340">They told us that they lived --------------, which at that time was not the headquarters of the uprising yet, and that they all have one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that that lady ---- 10 or 12 families, but they will be willing to designate a quarter for us so that we can go to the open-air <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and get a sack with straw, fill it, put it there, and live there for a while.</sentence><sentence id="341">That was end of December, beginning of January, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">We did that and unfortunately my uncle did not want to keep my brother either, so I had to bring my brother into this settlement of people in there.</sentence><sentence id="343">And we just existed, simply.</sentence><sentence id="344">My husband was going every morning with a group of the people.</sentence><sentence id="345">He was unloading coal, and as a reward he could take on his back a sack of coal as much as he could carry, four/for kilometers and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">And because we didn't want to use the coal to heat our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because we couldn't afford it, we would go and knock on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the people that still had a little money, and they would buy this coal from us.</sentence><sentence id="347">And for that money we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and buy a little bit of flour, whatever we could.</sentence><sentence id="348">And that's how we lived for three long months.</sentence><sentence id="349">We both were very ill, as you know, from disease and all kinds of indigestion and gastritis and typhoid fever; it was very prevalent, people lived under very inhuman circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="350">There was no proper food.</sentence><sentence id="351">My brother was nine years old, it was very difficult for me because he was in the growing stage and he did not understand all the things that are happening to us -- that we have to hide and we have to be beaten up.</sentence><sentence id="352">On January I believe 7th or 8th, the Germans surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> again and they took ---------- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="353">At that time there were still about 200,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I might be wrong with my numbers -- and then they took another 25,000 at that time and we had to hide in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we closed off.</sentence><sentence id="354">So it was just extremely difficult, it was just like the ----.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="581">A: His wife and a child.</sentence><sentence id="582">My uncle was an extremely intelligent, egoistic, self-centered person, who didn't get married until later in his life.</sentence><sentence id="583">He spoke English in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="584">He worked for the Joint Distribution Committee, he had a high position, but during the War when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> still had a lot of food from the peasants, my father would send -- we were allowed to send packages every week to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, a certain amount of food, and my father ------- supported him maybe a year.</sentence><sentence id="585">But -- I don't want to talk bad about my relatives but he just didn't do anything for us.</sentence><sentence id="586">He figured he wouldn't have enough money to survive for himself and he just practically threw us out into the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">It was winter, it was a very heavy winter.</sentence><sentence id="588">We didn't have proper clothes, we didn't have proper heat, we just sat in a corner with all these other people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">And one week when the Germans surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we locked off a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to try to hide -- we were maybe 30 people in that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we were just eating raw cabbage and radishes, and whatever we could put into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- we had no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, just a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="590">It was practically inhuman but otherwise the Germans would have found us.</sentence><sentence id="591">So we blocked off one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in front of it so the Germans would not know when they come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we are there.</sentence><sentence id="592">That's how we survived the deportation on January 7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, because we had no papers that we are working there.</sentence><sentence id="593">And then while we existed in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were hearing rumors -- it was already 1943 -- that something is cooking there, that there might be an uprising.</sentence><sentence id="594">The Jews are buying the munitions from the Poles said something might happen, that maybe really Germans are going to liquidate the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="595">And there were rumors that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is not going to exist any more because it was practically one of the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that the Germans kept.</sentence><sentence id="596">So what was happening is that a lot of Jews who still had some means, they were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">Those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> were not the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that were built by the Underground but they were <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that they</sentence></p><p><sentence id="598">0 built to survive.</sentence><sentence id="599">They thought that maybe if they built these very excessive <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and put water here and cooking facilities, that maybe they can survive in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> if the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> gets destroyed for reason, either through the Jewish uprising or for any other reason.</sentence><sentence id="600">And people who could contribute to go into those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> were partaking in this whole idea.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="601">Now, we didn't know anybody, we were absolutely orphans, we didn't know anybody there and we absolutely had no chance to ever think that we would be allowed to be taken into those <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="602">I was very sick, and after living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over three months all of a sudden I just felt an urge of getting out.</sentence><sentence id="603">It was just the opposite of what I thought three months ago -- three months before, I was outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for myself and I said, "Let me die like all the other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="604">You get shot and it's all over with."</sentence><sentence id="605">We still didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">But at that point -- it was spring, it was in February or March and I just felt an urge to be shut outside of the <span

normal living people for a while, and then if I go, it's different.</sentence><sentence id="608">I just felt it.</sentence><sentence id="609">And maybe for the sake of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="610">We just wanted to get out.</sentence><sentence id="611">First of all, you have to have the will, and then you have the opportunity, you know -- one without the other just doesn't work.</sentence><sentence id="612">And most of the Jews, and also us -- we had no will any more and that's why we came to this point.</sentence><sentence id="613">But at this point we somehow got our strength together to get the will to maybe want to get out.</sentence><sentence id="614">But getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I don't even have an example of the impossibility to this idea.</sentence><sentence id="615">There just isn't such a thing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="616">There's no such a thing that you can go to a 12-foot <span class="DLF">wall</span>, who surrounded by Germans, there's no such a thing that you get out and not be caught, because the whole area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always patrolled by Poles who only waited for somebody to run away.</sentence><sentence id="617">So it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="618">We had no connections but we had an idea and we started to

was buried in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by my father.</sentence><sentence id="635">I don't know exactly what treasure it was, you know, what was in it, but it was just a lot of things buried there.</sentence><sentence id="636">My father was instrumental in putting a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crate</span> together and putting it into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="REGION">earth area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="637">I would be willing to show somebody where this is, even go with them."</sentence><sentence id="638">It was so dangerous to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="639">This fellow said, "No 1 problem, we have Polish uniforms, we have Polish papers.</sentence><sentence id="640">I'm going to talk to my Polish friends and see if they would be willing to go and get this treasure out and get you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="641">So that was just the beginning of the dream, because he came back in a few more days and my husband saw him and he said, "Well, they would be willing.</sentence><sentence id="642">There's a whole group of people that would be willing to take you back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> and see if the treasure is really there."</sentence><sentence id="643">But my husband said to him, "You know, the way things look here, something is going to happen any day and I might just come back with all that money and treasure and my wife and her brother might be killed by then.</sentence><sentence id="644">If 1 am taken out to go for this treasure, I would like them to come with me at least out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and wait some <span class="NPIP">place</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until this all materializes."</sentence><sentence id="645">And that's exactly what happened, that miracle happened.</sentence><sentence id="646">That one day he came back to the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> and he said, "Dead on that date, at six in the morning, you come out with a group of workers and I will have two Polish people standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and pretending, when you just walk through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you walk and walk and then you walk away from the group, I'm going to have these people pretend that they grab you.</sentence><sentence id="647">They're going to grab you and they will take you on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> we are staying."</sentence><sentence id="648">And that's exactly what happened.</sentence><sentence id="649">The three of us went out in the morning, we went through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> and these two young people came up to us and grabbed us and took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">And there was the miracle.</sentence><sentence id="651">I think we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about two weeks before the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="652">Because while I was on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> already, I saw the ghetto burning and I heard all the remarks that the Polish people said because of the ghetto burning.</sentence><sentence id="653">They were kind of happy, some were.</sentence><sentence id="654">Of course the people that helped us, I must say, we had a lot of help from certain Polish people and we were taken to a family of an engineer who was from the Underground and who kept me and my brother until my husband and the whole group -- they arranged a whole group to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="655">They were prepared for all the adversities and they would arrange to take for this treasure, they gave him a uniform, a ----- uniform, and while they were gone I was waiting with my brother.</sentence><sentence id="656">There were some other Jewish people that this engineer, this Polish Underground person, kept in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> temporarily until these people were found <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> where they could hide.</sentence><sentence id="657">Well, they came back, and what happened was: First they came back when the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was frozen, so they couldn't dig.</sentence><sentence id="658">Then they went back ten days later and they were digging under very unusual circumstances -- the <span class="DLF">shaft</span> that it was buried in was going under the <span class="DLF">street</span>, they had to pretend that they measure the <span class="DLF">street</span> and do all kinds of repairs and things.</sentence><sentence id="659">And to make the story short, they found the case was empty.</sentence><sentence id="660">And that really saved our life, because otherwise these people would think that we were lying, that it was simply a trick to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but this whole case with all the things was buried was there.</sentence><sentence id="661">It was broken up and empty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="706">Q: The uprising happened -- let's go back to the time of the uprising, which is also the time that your husband was going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, or he went back first and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was frozen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="708">Then he came back, and then he went back again.</sentence><sentence id="709">Tell me how the uprising fit into all of this and where he learned where he was.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="710">A: Well, actually I personally have no experience of the uprising because we were fortunate enough to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> maybe two weeks prior to the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="711">What we knew was there was great preparations.</sentence><sentence id="712">Everything was very secretive and we knew they were preparing 2 <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>; we knew that they were buying a lot of ammunition <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, from the Poles, because that was the sources that the Jews were buying ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="713">We knew that things were going to happen, we knew that there's preparations, but because we got out about ten days before, I really have no knowledge of actually what happened, except from what I was reading I only can tell you that when we were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we stayed not far away -- of course the burning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> could be seen from miles and miles away and when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started it was just one glob of fire, you could see that all this <span class="REGION">area</span> was burning and a lot of <span class="DLF">streets</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were cordoned off.</sentence><sentence id="714">There was police, and there was German police and Polish police and you could not even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> and everything got stuck at a certain point because you could not get through because of the flame and because of the shooting and because of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="715">So the life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> per se was completely disrupted and I can be witness to this because I lived outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as an Aryan and I was moving, I wasn't hiding.</sentence><sentence id="716">At any time I was out, moving, so | unfortunately heard remarks from people that was very favorable to what was happening there.</sentence><sentence id="717">And of course I pretend no reaction but I was very hurt about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: With what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: Like things that the Jews are burning. "</sentence><sentence id="730">Now we're going to get rid of all the bedbugs," you know.</sentence><sentence id="731">Things that weren't very pleasant to me to hear.</sentence><sentence id="732">And yet there were Poles who helped me and kept me, right now, waiting for me to get my way through with arranging my life on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">But what was happening in there, I absolutely -- I mean I have an idea but I was not witness to it.</sentence><sentence id="734">Because we stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> from November 11 through maybe end of March or beginning of April; that was the extent of our life.</sentence><sentence id="735">We witnessed the last days of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> per se but we were not part of it all.</sentence><sentence id="736">I can not give information on that from what I --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning and there was a lot of gunfire, were you afraid, living as a gentile or in hiding?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Well, I was always afraid living as a gentile in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="748">Every day and every minute I was always very vulnerable.</sentence><sentence id="749">My living as a gentile consisted of having a piece of paper which I somehow secured or was secured for me and I had to pretend to be that person.</sentence><sentence id="750">But I have to digress back to the fact that when my husband came back and I was still with these people that kept me for about two weeks, and when he came back and when it turned out that there's no money in there, he was able to bring a little, a few things like, I think, two fur coats that his parents left with some gentile people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, and we planned to sell maybe two suitcases with clothes, -- everything on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was of value, and we planned to sell this.</sentence><sentence id="751">And at that time, these people that we stayed with, who were part of the Polish underground, told us that even so now there is no money to find us a secure <span class="NPIP">place</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they would not advise us or they don't want us to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at this point.</sentence><sentence id="752">Because they know things are going to happen there very soon and if we go back there it will be the end.</sentence><sentence id="753">So they would be willing to help us somehow establish ourselves on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>: meaning that we have no money to go into somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, pay for being 3 kept but that somehow I will have to find my way, maybe with their help, to establish my existence on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>; meaning that they helped me obtain a false identity.</sentence><sentence id="754">There were priests in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> that were selling birth certificates of somebody more or less the same age as I was of people that died and maybe their death wasn't registered properly.</sentence><sentence id="755">I could obtain a birth certificate of that person and therefore I would assume the identity of that person, and if I would have a real birth certificate from a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, I could go to a <span class="BUILDING">German office</span> which issues -- there was a camp called the -------, it was like a passport and everybody had to have that -- and I can obtain, if I have enough guts I can obtain which I would need to show them that I'm an Aryan.</sentence><sentence id="756">Which really I did.</sentence><sentence id="757">This what happened: they were helping me to try to maintain my identity as an Aryan, and I went to this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I got my paper.</sentence><sentence id="758">So I became this Lieutenant Viyeska (ph) who actually was three or four years older than I was but I had to assume her birth date; I was her.</sentence><sentence id="759">I had to completely unlearn, psychologically, of what happened of who I was.</sentence><sentence id="760">I had to be learning prayers, I had to be going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, I had to mingle with Polish people, but my problem was that I had my family with me and I have to find a way for them to survive too.</sentence><sentence id="761">What happened was that --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="778">Q: And you were successful because you didn't look Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: Because I didn't look Jewish, because I didn't speak -- at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Polish.</sentence><sentence id="781">My Polish was very proper -- there's all kinds of Polish and they can detect and recognize you right away, the Poles -- my language was proper.</sentence><sentence id="782">I was a girl, they could not recognize me where my husband -- only Jewish males were circumcised in Europe, and immediately anybody, whether it was a little Pole that's 16 years old and wants your watch, or whether it's a German, if they take in the corner, you're being recognized immediately.</sentence><sentence id="783">And that's why men were so handicapped in hiding; it was much easier for women.</sentence><sentence id="784">Now, my brother was also circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="785">Although he was very blond, with blue eyes, and he absolutely had no Semitic features but he was circumcised, and he could not play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with little children because he had a very sad look on his face.</sentence><sentence id="786">He knew that he doesn't have a mother and father and it was very difficult for him.</sentence><sentence id="787">Therefore, he had to be hiding, together with my husband, in order to play safe with them.</sentence><sentence id="788">So I had to be able to secure a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to live and a way to bring groceries for more people than just myself without being detected.</sentence><sentence id="789">And between 1943 April until October "44 there was a lot of different circumstances and a lot of things were going on on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">By then of course they cleaned up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was over with but it took a long time but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was completely surrounded -- you know, it was cut off from the <span class="REGION">ghetto side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="791">But I had a multitude of problems, because first of all I had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="792">I wasn't even thinking of going to work at that time, because work was scarce, and I was really scared, I mean, I still was myself, with my past, and with all my sensitivities and everything that I -- you can't just switch yourself off, I wasn't a -----, I was a vulnerable young girl who all of a sudden had all these problems to take care of and all these burdens.</sentence><sentence id="793">Well, at the beginning this engineer who was very, very nice helped me secure a tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was another lady who also wanted to live with me and we both rented a tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">In this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we built a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for her husband, my husband and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="795">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="796">The neighbors were never supposed to know that there's more than two people 4 living there, me and her, and we were supposed to go to work in the morning and come back at night.</sentence><sentence id="797">So these people had to be so quiet -- not flushing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, not walking, because we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> and there was, you know, people living on the bottom and on top of us.</sentence><sentence id="798">And it was very, very difficult, it was touch and go all the time, and every day you hear that they found some Jews here and they found some Jews there, and there were Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that didn't be discovered.</sentence><sentence id="799">There was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="800">We managed for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="801">I had to go shopping to different <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> so that I wouldn't bring too much food, you know.</sentence><sentence id="802">But that only was for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="803">After about six or seven months, the janitor -- they were always attuned to what was going on -- kind of went after me one day when I was shopping and he kind of understood that I'm buying more food than I should, and he denounced me.</sentence><sentence id="804">But we had certain things figured out at that time and my husband built with his bare fingers a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> which was a bombed-out part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was on the part of the ruins.</sentence><sentence id="805">So what they did is they put some boards there so from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> it looked like ruins but from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> it connected to our little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">And there was the side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> where they could sit there all day long.</sentence><sentence id="807">And the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was very cleverly disguised: it was an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> from the -- actually where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> is there was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> had wooden blocks.</sentence><sentence id="808">Now, one of those big wooden panels would slide up and there would be the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="809">So at night they would come out and sleep with us, but during the way they would go in there and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> you couldn't see anything because these panels were all the same all around.</sentence><sentence id="810">Anyway, they also figured out that in case I go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I get it trouble and they make me come back to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they would have a way -- I would have a certain knock or talk very loud and they would have a way to break through the <span class="DLF">outside wall</span> of that <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> which went out on the ruins and they would all run and they would tell me where they go -- we had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could find them.</sentence><sentence id="811">And the inevitable happened.</sentence><sentence id="812">One morning I went to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and the janitor came up to me with two policemen, Polish policemen, and they said, "Well, we heard that you are hiding Jews" -- the other lady was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then -- "we know that there are Jews here and we know that you are hiding Jews and this is not right, we have to go in and take a look of what is going on there."</sentence><sentence id="813">I told them that there is nobody there and I told them that I lost my key, I couldn't find it -- because I didn't want to open up with the key, I really want to give them the signal, this knock where they would know to run.</sentence><sentence id="814">I told them that I don't have the key.</sentence><sentence id="815">They were going to bring a locksmith to break in the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they did break in the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="816">By the time they broke in the <span class="DLF">door</span> there was nobody there, they were gone; I mean they didn't even find the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">They just looked around the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there was just nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="818">And we always kept it nice and tidy, just like two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, just the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="819">But they were just very upset because they didn't find anything and they told me that they're going to come back at four o'clock because they have to investigate and blah blah blah whatever they wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="820">Well, they took my papers and that was the problem, because right away they ask you who you are, and when you give them the papers then if they don't give them back to you, then you're dead, you have no papers, that's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="821">Well, in the meantime I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were and I told them what happened, and I said, "Look" -- it was only a temporary <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the day or two -- and I said, "Look, I don't know what to do now -- should I go back and face the music and get the papers back?"</sentence><sentence id="822">And I felt strong enough that 5 I really want to go and face up to them, because I really wanted my papers back.</sentence><sentence id="823">And what happened was that I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- of course I had everything in there -- and they never came back.</sentence><sentence id="824">So they never came back and I never got my papers back.</sentence><sentence id="825">But the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was no good any more, we could not return to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">So we had to move out of there.</sentence><sentence id="827">And at this point, this other friend of mine, she had to go her own way and I had to go my own way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="878">Q: Now, I just want to go back and ask you one question.</sentence><sentence id="879">When you didn't have the money to pay the Polish underground for getting you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or the Polish people, your friends, how come they still helped you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="882">A: Because in my path of life I found some very nice Polish people who maybe did not adore Jews but who from humane reasons felt compelled to help, who really could not live seeing all these atrocities that are being done and who felt that they maybe have to do a little bit to help the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="883">And I met actually three people like that in my <span class="DLF">path</span> and they were very important people to me.</sentence><sentence id="884">This one fellow who kept us at the beginning and who said to us, "Don't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I have no gain for you going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">I know you didn't lie, and if you can support yourself and establish yourself on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>, then if I can help you I will help you."</sentence><sentence id="886">He did help me secure this first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, you see, he did help me in giving me a little encouragement and showing me maybe how I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="887">So there was the first thing.</sentence><sentence id="888">Then later on, when they took my papers and when I was completely lost and I was at a point where I just didn't know what to do with myself and the war still was nowhere towards the end, I went to visit a friend of mine who was also hiding and there is a story to it, if I have a little time I will tell.</sentence><sentence id="889">While I had this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the gentleman who helped me, he was helping other Jews getting established on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>, and if he had to bring three or four Jews, he couldn't keep them in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he would bring them to my little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">Because I opened that -- I couldn't say, "Listen, I can't take them in."</sentence><sentence id="891">So I was helping him at that time, and at some point I could have had seven or eight people in there.</sentence><sentence id="892">And that's where this janitor really got the idea that something's going on.</sentence><sentence id="893">But once this was over with, they all had to go their own way.</sentence><sentence id="894">While I had this little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I met a girl from down the <span class="DLF">street</span> who was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">She said, "I need a big favor of you: I need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my husband to sleep for two nights, he's going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and we don't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> right now, so can he sleep by you for two nights?"</sentence><sentence id="896">I said, "Look, what's the difference if we sleep together on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>?</sentence><sentence id="897">Let him come."</sentence><sentence id="898">He came to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and he left a winter coat, he forgot his winter coat.</sentence><sentence id="899">A few days letter I get a little letter from her telling me that he needs the coat and if I don't mind to bring the coat to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she is at this moment.</sentence><sentence id="900">Well, on one Sunday I decided that I'm going to take the coat to her.</sentence><sentence id="901">That was a heavy winter coat on my arm and a purse and I got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="902">And they stole my purse.</sentence><sentence id="903">So that was on top of not having my papers, they stole my purse with my money and by the time I got to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the coat I was in very desperate mood, I was ready to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="904">I said, "Now I have nothing.</sentence><sentence id="905">I have a husband that's sitting and waiting for me, I have a brother that is sitting and waiting for me that I have to support, and now I don't even have a paper any more and | don't have any money and I don't know what I'm going to do with myself."</sentence><sentence id="906">And I came in there crying 6 terribly.</sentence><sentence id="907">And there was a man sitting there and he looked at me -- he was the one who would be instrumental to take this man to a gentleman who would take my friend's husband to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> -- and he looks at me.</sentence><sentence id="908">He says, "My God, what's the matter with you?</sentence><sentence id="909">You're so young, you can't be so desperate."</sentence><sentence id="910">I said, "Look, right now I have no means of survival and I'm at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which I can't cross."</sentence><sentence id="911">And he said to me, "You know you look very well, you look like an Aryan, why don't you want to work a little?"</sentence><sentence id="912">I said, "Work?</sentence><sentence id="913">What can I do?"</sentence><sentence id="914">He said, "I can get a job for you and I can help you out, so don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="915">If you need some money, I'm going to hand you some money and if you want me to go with you to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where they give the documents" -- because I lost my purse, my purse was stolen -- he said, "I'm going to take you on Monday and I'm going to say that you are my cousin, and I'm going to tell them that they stole your purse on the so-and-so <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and they have to give you a duplicate.</sentence><sentence id="916">As simple as that.</sentence><sentence id="917">And then you come to me and I will tell you what you're going to be doing for me."</sentence><sentence id="918">So that was my guardian angel.</sentence><sentence id="919">He actually met me that day, my girl friend ------ took the coat and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="920">He met me and he took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and he told them this story and I got a copy of my original passport.</sentence><sentence id="921">And the next day he gave me an address, he told me where I should go and he told me that he is hiding about 20 Jews in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that these Jews have no means of supporting themselves.</sentence><sentence id="922">He was a single man.</sentence><sentence id="923">I would say he was in the 40s.</sentence><sentence id="924">He was a past pilot in the Polish air force, he has been wounded many times, was not in the best of health.</sentence><sentence id="925">A great humanitarian, who kept on saying, "I don't like Jews but I have to help you."</sentence><sentence id="926">And these people that were living in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- I don't know how they got to him but they needed some means of survival and they knew how to manufacture -- I mean this is bizarre -- how to make certain things that could be sold on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and they couldn't get out to sell it.</sentence><sentence id="927">They were looking for somebody who could go out and sell this for them so that they can survive.</sentence><sentence id="928">And that person was, he found me in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="929">And I said, "Well, I have to talk to my husband, I don't think that he would want me to walk around <span class="NPIP">places</span> like open- air markets and <span class="BUILDING">flea markets</span> and sell stuff.</sentence><sentence id="930">He would probably be worried, you know, that they recognize me."</sentence><sentence id="931">He said, "You go and talk to him."</sentence><sentence id="932">Well, when I talked to my husband he wasn't very much for it, but we really had no choice, we were three people that had to survive.</sentence><sentence id="933">I went to him every morning and he gave me a little suitcase.</sentence><sentence id="934">What these people were manufacturing was hairnets.</sentence><sentence id="935">There was a great fashion at that time of heavy nets -- I think in the 40s they had them here too -- they were all different colors and you were wearing them like down from your head to cover your hair and they were like brown and gray and all kinds of colors; heavy, knit, made by hand.</sentence><sentence id="936">And these Jews had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> some <span class="NPIP">place</span> before the War and they knew how to do it manually.</sentence><sentence id="937">And then they were also making elastics, they knew how to make elastics.</sentence><sentence id="938">They would cut the thread from the inner tubes by hand and then they would take some silk, dye the silk different colors and they would make round little elastic.</sentence><sentence id="939">When you buy a piece of round elastic that's what they were doing by hand, putting it on little cardboards and putting a label around it; and of course there was nothing like that because all the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="940">And they wanted to sell it and they could manufacture a lot of it.</sentence><sentence id="941">So I got a little suitcase and they told me where to do.</sentence><sentence id="942">The place I went was a <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span>, the biggest one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, where the worst element of people were selling, I mean the lowest from the lowest, people that would not hesitate to chop you up in pieces if they would know who I was.</sentence><sentence id="943">But somehow, I don't know, I had the 7 courage because I had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="944">I wasn't a hero, by no means, | did it for my own survival and I did it because I had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="945">And [laughing] I developed a very nice <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">I was liked by the people, I got my own clients and own customers, and they were giving me orders, they were selling, they were giving me orders for more.</sentence><sentence id="947">I would put my orders with them and they would fill my orders and that was going on like that.</sentence><sentence id="948">And then one day this engineer said to me, "You know, why don't we teach your husband," who was sitting and doing nothing, "why don't I take him over there and we'll train him and we'll teach him how to do it so he can do it too, rather than sitting at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="949">And what happened was that he actually learned how to do it, and I was selling our own merchandise and the merchandise of the other people, and that's how we all had a chance to survive.</sentence><sentence id="950">I have to mention that by then I had another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">This <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not my own but through somebody I found a lady who was willing to share her very small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with me but I had to pay her more than more than usual -- this lady needed money, she was a widow, and she tried to survive; she was peddling a little bit merchandise here and there.</sentence><sentence id="952">And then she said that we could have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in one of her <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and that we could -- I would pay her, for instance, if normally she would take 50 or 100 dollars from another Polish person, she took 800 from me.</sentence><sentence id="953">She really did it for the money but she was a person that had a lot of heart and understanding for me but she really needed the money, it meant surviving for her too.</sentence><sentence id="954">She had to pay for the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she had expenses.</sentence><sentence id="955">So at that point we lived with her.</sentence><sentence id="956">Of course my husband was still in hiding and nobody knew that he was there and he also made a little hiding in the an ------- which I'm going to let him tell you about it.</sentence><sentence id="957">And we lived with that lady.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: And you were able to make enough money to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1038">A: I was able to make enough money to pay her.</sentence><sentence id="1039">I was able to make enough money for us to eat well and I was also able to make enough money to save.</sentence><sentence id="1040">Because when the Polish uprising in 1944 happened, of which part my mentor was very much involved with and he was one of the officers in the uprising, I did a saving that I tried to locate somehow.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Now, what I didn't mention that I lost my brother in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1042">It's a very painful thing to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="1043">In July -- was it 1943?</sentence><sentence id="1044">yes, in July he was sitting in that hiding with my husband, this other man, and he really had a very, very poor life because he couldn't play -- you know, it's hard to confine a nine-year-old to a poor little <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, also he was wonderful, he was so good.</sentence><sentence id="1045">But I knew that this situation can't go on like this, he wasn't eating properly.</sentence><sentence id="1046">At that time I didn't work yet, which was in the old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and one day I found out that there is such a thing as a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1047">I don't know how much information there is in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> about this particular thing that I'm going to talk about but I would like to know because I can tell about it.</sentence><sentence id="1048">It was a scheme from the Germans, it was called <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span> that was was an old fancy <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and what the Germans did, they spread rumors that they're going to send people to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and that these Jews were going to be exchanged for German prisoners of war with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and they were looking for Jews to come to this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they will transport these Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1049">Actually they took one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and sent them there.</sentence><sentence id="1050">And now the people thought that this is a legitimate thing and everybody that was in hiding -- because you see the Jews that were hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and paying all this money for 8 hiding eventually the money goes out, eventually these people get more tired and tired of keeping the Jews, eventually there is more people that is being discovered.</sentence><sentence id="1051">It's a very vulnerable situation.</sentence><sentence id="1052">These Jews had no assurance that they're going to survive and the matter of fact everybody that we know and the family ------------, everybody is there.</sentence><sentence id="1053">Sooner or later somehow from many <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and from many <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> these people were found and kept.</sentence><sentence id="1054">So, when the rumor was spread that there is such a thing as this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, people jumped at it and it was very hard to get in.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Matter of fact, the Germans even had a way to take money from these Jews, so that it was really kept up beautiful and the people that was supposed to leave in two weeks were living there already.</sentence><sentence id="1056">I met the girl who was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, whom I knew very well and she used to be a neighbor of ours and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with her younger brother.</sentence><sentence id="1057">Because when she saw me, she said, "Oh my God, what are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="1058">And she was dressed beautiful, she was a beautiful woman.</sentence><sentence id="1059">I said, "Well, we're in hiding and I can't get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and I don't know what to do."</sentence><sentence id="1060">She said, "Oh my God, I'll be happy to help you."</sentence><sentence id="1061">It turned out that she was the mistress of the man who was arranging all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and she told me, "You know, I can help you.</sentence><sentence id="1062">If you want to send your brother with me, I promise you that I'm going to take care of him.</sentence><sentence id="1063">I remember my little brother and I remember he was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with you and if you want to send him with me, I'll take care of him" She said, "Were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, I'm going out tomorrow to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> -- I need some very fancy clothes, and I know all these people here and I know there's a group of students going.</sentence><sentence id="1064">And if you want me to, I'll take care of him."</sentence><sentence id="1065">She was crying, she says, "I lost my family, I lost my brother, and I promise you that I'm going to take care of him."</sentence><sentence id="1066">She did not know the truth of what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1067">Now, that was something I couldn't refuse, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we talked about.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And I said to my husband, "Look, we can't go, here there's still a long time to the end of the war, who knows what's going to happen?</sentence><sentence id="1069">People are paying thousands of dollars in foreign currency to get in.</sentence><sentence id="1070">I met people, I talked to people that were actually getting out of hiding, paying in money to go; and they believed in it."</sentence><sentence id="1071">Who was I to think that it's not so?</sentence><sentence id="1072">I was only sorry that we couldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1073">And we talked it over, I went and I bought a suitcase and I bought some clothes for him.</sentence><sentence id="1074">We were supposed to meet on a certain day and I was supposed to take him there.</sentence><sentence id="1075">And the morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was leaving -- incidentally, one of my relatives, my aunt, and her little girl also was there, and also ------ with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because she knew somebody who was arranging for it.</sentence><sentence id="1076">And that's what it happened, it was in July "43 that I lost him.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I took him there in the morning, and I saw her leave with him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>, I said goodbye to him, I said goodbye to her, she promised me she's going to take care of him, she was sincere about it.</sentence><sentence id="1078">I saw all the people go in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to the ------- wherever they were going to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, we said goodbye, he told me he's going to write to me, and that was the end I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1079">Later, through the Polish underground paper it was mentioned that they took all the people from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and they took them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, where they didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="1080">And also, the rest of the people that lived there and waited for the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> were also taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1081">So, my brother would have been now 60 years old.</sentence><sentence id="1082">So that's how I lost him, and there were just the two of us from then.</sentence><sentence id="1083">So at the time where I found this man who gave me a job, and when I was working and having the money and being able to support myself, there was just the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="1084">So that what was going on more or less.</sentence><sentence id="1085">I was working, and my husband was making whatever he could, and I was selling, and we 9 were living quietly because nobody knew about his existence.</sentence><sentence id="1086">And I lived with that lady.</sentence><sentence id="1087">We had a few close encounters, for instance, her drunken cousin wanted to come and sleep over one night and my husband had to go in hiding and the hiding was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>, he passed out in there, it was just terrible; I think that maybe he will throw more details on this particular situation.</sentence><sentence id="1088">And that's how we lived, quietly, incognito, till about shortly 1944.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I have to tell you that this engineer, whose name is Selek -----sky (ph), he has been honored with a gold medal from the Israeli Government and his is the first place in the Valley of the Righteous that these people established, because most of those people survived the Warsaw uprising, not the ghetto uprising, the other uprising, he got them all out ------.</sentence><sentence id="1090">And there were rumors that he was killed I read, but then he did survive.</sentence><sentence id="1091">He really was honored by the Jews who are living now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and by the State of Israel.</sentence><sentence id="1092">He also had a few close encounters.</sentence><sentence id="1093">For instance, there was a woman that was in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was ready to deliver a baby and he did not know about it, she was apparently camouflaging it.</sentence><sentence id="1094">And in the last minute when she ----- the baby, he had to call a doctor whom he had to pay dearly and they didn't have the money, so he ran over to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the morning screaming, "I need 3000 zlotys immediately, this woman is having a baby in my <span class="NPIP">place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1095">So we gave it to him and she did have the baby, and apparently they put it right up to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>; but I understand that she survived and they got the baby back.</sentence><sentence id="1096">So I was not in fact with these people after the war but I know that most of them survived and live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1097">It wasn't until 1944 when he came over one day to us -- he was coming quite often to us because he was lonely; and he was telling us that there's going to be an uprising, a Polish uprising, in October 1944, that the Polish people are beginning an uprising because the Russians are coming closer, and the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> is now on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> which was dividing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> into two parts: there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> on one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> and on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>, and what was happening that the Russian army was advancing up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> and there were rumors that they're going to stop.</sentence><sentence id="1098">In the meantime the Polish Government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> decided that there's going to be a Polish uprising, that the Polish people will try to save <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> from being occupied by the Russians and they're going to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1099">So these were these people, who were organized who had munitions, but they were against a German army with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> with all kinds of bombs, and they tried to stake an uprising.</sentence><sentence id="1100">And he told us about it.</sentence><sentence id="1101">He said, "I want to warn you that there's going to be an uprising and things are going to be tough.</sentence><sentence id="1102">I want you to prepare food, and if you have any money, money's going to be no good.</sentence><sentence id="1103">So I want you to go and do something with it."</sentence><sentence id="1104">I said, "What would I do with the money I have?"</sentence><sentence id="1105">He said, "Why don't you go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy some rings."</sentence><sentence id="1106">So here I went to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and ended up with eleven wedding bands and that was my treasure.</sentence><sentence id="1107">So of course the uprising was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1108">We were both severely wounded.</sentence><sentence id="1109">The second week of the uprising took about four weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1110">350,000 people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1111">Three-quarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was destroyed; that's why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> is all rebuilt now because three-quarters of it was destroyed by the Germans because of the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="1112">They were coming in systematically and bombing all the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because they knew there's this new cry of underground here; and the Polish underground killed a number of Germans, but still it was no comparison of what the Germans had done and the Germans could do.</sentence><sentence id="1113">So it was terrible, it was a very, very terrible time.</sentence><sentence id="1114">At night my husband used to go to work and help them save some grain from burning <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> because the population was 0 starving and the Germans were having a feast, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1115">Some of them were being killed but still they had a hold on the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1116">We had to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, because the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I lived with this lady they were bombing every day and at one point we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, and we saw some other Jews creep out from another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1117">But at that point we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, the Poles and the Jews, so at that point nobody really had time to care who was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>, who was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1118">And that was going on for two or three weeks until one day our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was destroyed and that's where I was buried in debris completely.</sentence><sentence id="1119">My husband just pulled me out by a leg and I sustained permanent injury to my ear, and my husband was also injured at the same time and we had to move to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> still <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and we waited until in October 1944 the uprising was completely over, it was suppressed, and the Germans decided to evacuate the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">The Russians waited patiently while the Poles and the Germans were killing each other -- they were in no hurry at that point, they knew they've got the situation covered and they can come in any time.</sentence><sentence id="1121">So they suspended, you know, the quest for maybe three or four months.</sentence><sentence id="1122">They sat on the other part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span>, and mind you, the Jews that were fighting in that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were already liberated and some people were trying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>, under the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, to swim through in order to be liberated; and here we knew that within seven or eight kilometres from where we were these people were already free and we still had the Germans, and God knows what's going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="1123">So it was really a terrible situation because at that time half of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was already taken by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1124">The provisional government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was established in 1944 in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, and we were still heavy under the Germans, dying every day.</sentence><sentence id="1125">When the Germans decided to evacuate all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, we had no choice but to leave, and at that point we didn't know where they're going to take us and what's going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="1126">We knew that the war is going to end soon because ---------- artillery and we knew it's a matter of months but we were still under the Germans and we had no choice but to go with them whatever they're going to take us.</sentence><sentence id="1127">So that's what happened: we were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, everybody had to leave, all the Poles, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was empty.</sentence><sentence id="1128">But there was an aura of thinking that whoever is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> is somehow connected to the uprising, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1129">The Poles all over the <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> thought that we were all from the uprising, that we were all from the underground, and especially being wounded and being hurt, they didn't really think there would be some Jews among us, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1130">So at that point we somehow managed, and my husband too, to get through with them.</sentence><sentence id="1131">Also, at that time we were all taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krushkupf</span> (ph), it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and that was a gigantic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> that's where all the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was taken.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And from there they were doing selections: the young people that were healthy were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work for <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, the old people we didn't know what they're going to do with them but this was the petrifying moment of my life, because we were never separate, we always managed to be together; you know, like families, and husband and wife, were separated.</sentence><sentence id="1133">Up on this point we always managed to be together.</sentence><sentence id="1134">Now, at this point we were kind Hof scared because I was afraid that if they take him to work to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, we will have to go to a doctor to see if he's healthy and then they're going to find out who he was.</sentence><sentence id="1135">So we were really in a limbo.</sentence><sentence id="1136">And then we were walking into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> not knowing really what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1137">While we 1 were walking in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, there were nuns there -- I don't know what they were doing, I don't know if they were helping to evacuate the Poles, and one of the nuns walked up to us and said, "Why don't you go the right?</sentence><sentence id="1138">It's ----- the wife to go to the right.</sentence><sentence id="1139">Go to the right, don't ask any questions, go to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>

very primitive.</sentence><sentence id="1162">They put up four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and a sack for us to sleep at night.</sentence><sentence id="1163">In the daytime we needed the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because everything was in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a lot of children there.</sentence><sentence id="1164">But somehow we managed to get their confidence.</sentence><sentence id="1165">I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday, and at Christmas it was very difficult because the Polish people had a ceremonial Christmas Eve and we were invited to this [she laughs] to a very important person there, you know, for Christmas dinner and I had to pretend that I am really very sick and cannot make it at the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="1166">So it was touch and go, and because there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for the children, my husband established a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, for which the peasants were very grateful.</sentence><sentence id="1167">And somehow they kept us there and we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="1168">It doesn't mean that there wasn't rumors every day when they found a family some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, hiding, and that they 2 chopped them up to death.</sentence><sentence id="1169">This was just like daily news.</sentence><sentence id="1170">But somehow we survived this ordeal too.</sentence><sentence id="1171">In the beginning of January, when the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> was coming closer, we were liberated by the Russians, and that was the greatest that could ever happen to us -- to see the first Russian soldier come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was just like seeing Messiah.</sentence><sentence id="1172">We still had to pretend that we're not so happy, because the Polish people did not like the idea that the Russians are coming, and the anti-Communists especially, they did not want <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to take over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we had to kind of be very diplomatic about it and, you know, really keep it cool and now to show it how happy we are that the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And as the Russians were coming in, we saw Germans beheaded, we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of Germans with no heads, I mean they were really getting it from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Katyusha</span> and from the artillery of the Russians coming in.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And we slowly had to convince the Russians that we are Jews, they didn't believe us; because we needed certain permits to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, things were very difficult at that time you know -- people could not just move around, the Russians were still advancing, it was still January 1945, the war wasn't over till actually May.</sentence><sentence id="1175">But we wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we didn't want to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1176">My husband had a very close encounter with a Russian who told him, "I don't think you're a Jew, I think you're a spy, there's no more Jews here, we know that Hitler killed them all."</sentence><sentence id="1177">And my husband says to him, "Listen, is there any Russian soldier here that maybe knows Yiddish?</sentence><sentence id="1178">I know a little Yiddish."</sentence><sentence id="1179">So they found a little guy and this guy came over and says, in Russian -- my husband speaks some Russian - - "You think you're a Jew?"</sentence><sentence id="1180">So: tell me a Jewish prayer."</sentence><sentence id="1181">And he said, "Geshmah" (ph).And you know what?</sentence><sentence id="1182">They started to kiss and embrace.</sentence><sentence id="1183">And that's how slowly we told the peasants that we have to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, we didn't tell them anything else, we want to see what's going on there.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And we said goodbye to them.</sentence><sentence id="1185">And mostly on foot we started our migration back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1186">Of course we didn't find anybody there.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Later on we went back to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we took some clothes and things for the children, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1188">---------------[proper mames] never found out who we were.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Now, my husband developed hepatitis and we didn't want him to go to the doctor --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1352">Q: -- and I think we should put up another roll, maybe a shorter roll.</sentence><sentence id="1353">Do you think you can</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1356">3 Tape #3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1357">A: Okay, I would like to just mention briefly an incident that while we lived with these peasants, my husband became gravely ill and he developed hepatitis.</sentence><sentence id="1358">He was really in very bad shape and almost dying, and he refused to go to a doctor, because he was afraid that being examined, the doctor is going to find out who he was.</sentence><sentence id="1359">But he was already so ill that the peasants would absolutely don't take no for an answer, and we had to go 13 kilometers in the winter in the snow to get to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a doctor, where they were very helpful, because they wanted my husband to live.</sentence><sentence id="1360">They dressed him up very warm and they took a couple of horses and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, and then we went to this doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1361">As we walked into the <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span>, my husband noticed that he had a little plague there which said that he was a railroad doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1362">My husband walked into him and he says, "Oh, you're doctor so- and-so.</sentence><sentence id="1363">I remember you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I used to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> too."</sentence><sentence id="1365">They shook hands and they became friends right away, and actually when he needed a shot, he had the nurse just do it for him, and he did not really examine him.</sentence><sentence id="1366">So there was a little close encounter which I wanted to mention.</sentence><sentence id="1367">Well, to make my story a little more concise, we went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1368">There was some Jews coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and some Jews coming back from Polish, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but unfortunately we found out that there was nobody.</sentence><sentence id="1369">My husband found some uncles there, and he will tell about that.</sentence><sentence id="1370">We did not want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> too long.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I felt that every stone had blood on it, and every <span class="DLF">wall</span> had memories for me.</sentence><sentence id="1372">I never went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my parents lived.</sentence><sentence id="1373">I went back to the lady who send the Gestapo for me, and I really wanted, went to the police to talk to them about it, and to see if she can be reprimanded.</sentence><sentence id="1374">But they told me there was no witnesses, so we just let it go.</sentence><sentence id="1375">Only God was my witness at that time, but it ended up well for me, so I'm alive.</sentence><sentence id="1376">We went to live in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, because my husband wanted to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1377">He had too his <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> behind him.</sentence><sentence id="1378">So we found out that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>, which became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Broslof</span> (ph), there is a <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and that his professors from the previous <span class="BUILDING">school</span> will be there.</sentence><sentence id="1379">He had no documents and no papers.</sentence><sentence id="1380">He was accepted to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> for the third year and we spend a year there.</sentence><sentence id="1381">That we also belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Acubootz</span> (ph) there, that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Acubootz</span> (ph) of students.</sentence><sentence id="1382">And after he completed the third year and he could secure papers, we decided to go into the world.</sentence><sentence id="1383">We absolutely didn't want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1384">The memories were just too terrible, and there was an opportunity to leave into the <span class="NPIP">unknown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1385">We just took a knapsack and went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1386">We were aided by the Breha (ph), by the Israeli officials who were helping Jews get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time, and we just went into the world.</sentence><sentence id="1387">We were fortunate to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> my husband was able to continue <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> at that time, and we became a part of a group of 400 Jewish students who came from all over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and who were able to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1388">The reason that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was lenient to those people is because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by all four, and the Americans made sure that Jewish students were not only accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, but they also paid very, very low tuition.</sentence><sentence id="1389">Well, anti-Semitism was great, and the German professors were not that happy to promote Jewish students, but people still studied there and my husband was able to get his medical diploma there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1390">We stayed there for four years.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I was working a little bit, and I decided to also to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1392">After I 4 was at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> for two years, he was ready with his <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, and we couldn't wait to get out, because we secured some papers to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from a distant family that I found and who were very gracious to send us papers, but they told us not to come before my husband is ready with his studies.</sentence><sentence id="1393">So four years later, on October 1950, we were brought into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and from then on we felt free, we felt happy.</sentence><sentence id="1394">We were young enough to want to start a new life.</sentence><sentence id="1395">We were young enough to try to cut off the past as much as we could.</sentence><sentence id="1396">We decided that this is our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, we are going to live here, there's not going back, there's no complaining we have to become American citizens.</sentence><sentence id="1397">We have to take the opportunity that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has given us.</sentence><sentence id="1398">My husband has a good profession.</sentence><sentence id="1399">I felt that I didn't finish my studies, so when the children grew up a little bit, I went back to get my degree.</sentence><sentence id="1400">We were fortunate to have things fall into place for us.</sentence><sentence id="1401">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where my husband was interning, then we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a short while, and then we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> where we build our life practically from scratch.</sentence><sentence id="1402">But we were fortunate that we were able to do so.</sentence><sentence id="1403">We have a great family.</sentence><sentence id="1404">Our nuclear family was two, then it became four, and now we are 11.</sentence><sentence id="1405">So we did a good job, a very close-knit family, our family is now substituting for the family we lost.</sentence><sentence id="1406">We are very fortunate to have great children.</sentence><sentence id="1407">They are married, three granddaughters.</sentence><sentence id="1408">And I feel that we build our lives and we were able to project to the children a normal set of values, not trying to burden them with our past.</sentence><sentence id="1409">However, they have to know.</sentence><sentence id="1410">They were maybe always more sensitive to us because they knew that that's all we have is them.</sentence><sentence id="1411">They are very attentive.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And except for the bad memories, I don't think that I have much of a stigma of really what happened now, because I still was 18 and 20 years old when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1413">I think that when you're older and when you have more of the past on you, like previous marriages and children that you lost, it's much harder to adjust in your life.</sentence><sentence id="1414">But I must say that I adjusted to the life here very well, and embraced life for whatever it could offer me.</sentence><sentence id="1415">Tried to compensate for lost time and my lost youth, and grateful to God that it all happened that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1476">Q: I want to ask you a couple of things.</sentence><sentence id="1477">You lived for a long time Azonarian (ph) Tell me what that ended up doing for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1480">A: Well, living Azonarian (ph) actually didn't do anything for me, because the way I was brought up, I always knew who I was.</sentence><sentence id="1481">My family was not religious.</sentence><sentence id="1482">My father was the founder of a Zionist youth movement in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I always knew who I was.</sentence><sentence id="1484">I always had holidays.</sentence><sentence id="1485">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> where Hebrew was taught everyday.</sentence><sentence id="1486">I was among Jewish people, Jewish friends, and I always knew who I was.</sentence><sentence id="1487">I could have never lost my identity, and I was fortunate to marry somebody of my own faith.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Now, just to give you an example, I had friends, who at my age, 14, 15, were also in the same situation that I was.</sentence><sentence id="1489">But they somehow found Polish mates, who maybe at that time were helping them to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1490">They never went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span> or went back to being Jewish, and I cannot, I'm not the judge for them.</sentence><sentence id="1491">I cannot blame them for that.</sentence><sentence id="1492">But this is what happened to many people.</sentence><sentence id="1493">This is what happened to a lot of males who married Gentile women, who were helping them and stayed in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and are raising Gentile families.</sentence><sentence id="1494">That happens to women that encountered the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1495">Some broke off and some stayed at the same.</sentence><sentence id="1496">So I was just fortunate always to know who I was, and to be able to share my life with a person 5 who was of my own faith, and therefore it was never any question for me to be anything else but a Jew, because my parents instilled that in me, and because there was just not a way for me.</sentence><sentence id="1497">It was just that everything else was just done out of need.</sentence><sentence id="1498">If] had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, it meant nothing to me.</sentence><sentence id="1499">If I had to be arrogant, it meant nothing to me.</sentence><sentence id="1500">To me it was only a means of survival, and I was fortunate enough not to have to continue this falsehood and get back to myself to be whoever I am.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1523">Q: And when you lived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Azonarian</span> (ph) you learned a lot about anti-Semitism, that you think you otherwise wouldn't have learned.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1527">Q: Tell me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1529">A: Yeah, this is very unfortunate, because I lived Azonarian through the two years during the war, and also for a certain time when we were liberated, I did not want to go back to my Jewish name until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, for cowardly reasons, I did not trust them.</sentence><sentence id="1530">There were programs after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>, there were programs all over.</sentence><sentence id="1531">There was a lot of hatred, and I didn't want to survive the war and then something happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="1532">For instance, I always telling my husband that if we live in Europe and I have a child and it's going to be male, I would never circumcise that child, because of my brother, who I think I lost because of that.</sentence><sentence id="1533">I had certain feelings and certain stigma.</sentence><sentence id="1534">After the war, I encountered a lot of anti- Semitism, I mean sayings like, for instance, "Oh, look at this Jew on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1535">Hitler didn't kill them all.</sentence><sentence id="1536">Here they're getting out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1537">Here we have them again.</sentence><sentence id="1538">We thought that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is going to be without Jews."</sentence><sentence id="1539">So, I couldn't help but hearing all that, and that just made me feel very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1540">I could not say anything, because I still did not want anybody to know that I was Jewish up until we left, and then, of course, my husband came back to his own name, because he had to have false papers too, just in case they catch him.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And then, of course, as soon as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we became students we decided that we absolutely want our name back and we wanted to be who we were.</sentence><sentence id="1542">And that's why, you know, everything went back to our name.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Our kept my first name because it was so hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="1544">I was so attuned to it already, and there was just me, you know, between the age of 16 or 17.</sentence><sentence id="1545">I was just so used to it already, that I modified it a little bit and kept my Hebrew name as a middle name, and just stayed with that name.</sentence><sentence id="1546">But it's very unfortunate that I have to say that, but this is the very truth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
