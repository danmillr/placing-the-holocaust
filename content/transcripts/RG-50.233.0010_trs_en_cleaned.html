<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Right and he got packages from time to time with preserves or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="102">I don't know stuff like that, that was the big deal and he would sometimes give to the more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some of them, the ones that were poor were really poor.</sentence><sentence id="103">Like my father in his youth had two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="104">That was a big deal because the poor children had just one pair of shoes for the Sabbath and during the weekday they would just go barefoot.</sentence><sentence id="105">You know we're talking poverty here.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="106">Q3 Yeah, how long was your father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkatch</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: He was there until he was about seventeen or eighteen although I think there may have been some other Yeshiva in there as well, some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> but I think he was away for a total of four or five years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Now the time that he was going there this <span class="REGION">territory</span> passed from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">Did he tell any stories about the Hungarians taking over?</sentence><sentence id="111">Now he was, of course.</sentence><sentence id="112">A Hungarian citizen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: This <span class="REGION">territory</span> was separated from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at the end of World War I and then taken back right around the time that your father went up there.</sentence><sentence id="123">Now you're not aware of any connection between his going to Munkatch (he would have been over thirteen years of age) that would be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the Hungarians march in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: And he's there for how many years?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Four or five.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Four or five years.</sentence><sentence id="133">So he's separated from the rest of the family for quite a while.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Well, he would visit obviously and stuff.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Yeah, but I mean he's living apart.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> spoke many languages.</sentence><sentence id="141">My father didn't speak Czech, did not.</sentence><sentence id="142">But many of the, like for example, the typical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant culture so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="143">And then either Ukrainian or Czech.</sentence><sentence id="144">And of course he would read Hebrew because that was the prayer language.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: So your father's family, going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now, when they were growing up, were they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">That was their first language.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue.</sentence><sentence id="159">And they read Hebrew and they studied in Hebrew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Your father did.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: But he especially in the Yeshiva training.</sentence><sentence id="167">Any other languages/</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Well later on he studied German.</sentence><sentence id="171">What happened was, I'm not sure what year but I think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he should learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew that the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> is going to be taken away or something, not by the 5</sentence><sentence id="173">Germans because there weren't Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism and the Kolneilash.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: The Arrow Cross</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: The Arrow Cross, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: The Hungarian fascists.</sentence><sentence id="184">Hungarian Nazis.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the lingua franca of the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: So he started to study German and tailoring.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Right, sort of like <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Did he actually go to a <span class="BUILDING">formal school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: This is a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he went to in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span></sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: You don't know which...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: I don't know where.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: This would have been when he was about eighteen you say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="204">I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the Hungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like the A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the lowest)...and he would never get a one, he would only got a two.</sentence><sentence id="205">And one time he asked her how come I don't get a one I did the best paper in the class?</sentence><sentence id="206">She said to Jews I don't give ones.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Now originally did anyone plan on him becoming a Rabbi considering all the studying that he was...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking over the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span>, I'm not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the studier of the family.</sentence><sentence id="214">But I don't think a Rabbi as such was considered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Now Adolph, did he lose the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took it away when they took power.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: The Hungarian Nazis.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Hungarian Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="227">There were a series of laws passed.</sentence><sentence id="228">First there were quotas imposed on what Jews can and can't do in terms of university admissions or ownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means they couldn't attend <span class="BUILDING">university</span> at all; they couldn't have any property other than personal property.</sentence><sentence id="229">So they were taken away and there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> created in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> and then...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: But not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Najhalaas</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: I don't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Najhalaas</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: It would be too small probably but there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in 1944 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: I don't know if it's 1944 but it's some time in there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: Your father has returned by then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="244">A; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: So he leaves <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkatch</span>, he studies at a <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and then he leaves that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Well I think that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or near <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already, the <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Okay, so the family is together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: The family is together, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Including your uncle Julah?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="257">My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of crisis and you'll see that later on also.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="258">Q; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: You don't know whether he was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or planning on a trade?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: No, Okay, so back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="271">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that my father lived in because my father lived in the <span class="REGION">Jewish community area</span> where all the other Jews lived so I don't think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them.</sentence><sentence id="272">The people from not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> but the whole <span class="REGION">area</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyireghaza</span> was sort of the local capital there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nadjhalaas</span> perhaps?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Perhaps -- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were brought in and they were shoved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> including my father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">My father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was relatively comfortable because again they were pretty well off.</sentence><sentence id="280">And they were moved in there and it was pretty uncomfortable because there were many people per <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">There were several families living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">And then I think the last year 1944 is when the deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">They weren't told where they're going.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: By Hungarians or by Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: I think it was mostly Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="293">The Germans didn't have the manpower to do all this stuff.</sentence><sentence id="294">What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal belongings and mail it to this address that was given to them.</sentence><sentence id="295">They were told that thats's where they're going to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">It's a Hungarian address.</sentence><sentence id="297">So they had to package everything and mailed everything to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: To a Hungarian address to an assumed <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">This was their assumed destination.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Assumed <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">My father said that the address was a phony address.</sentence><sentence id="310">They never really read the address.</sentence><sentence id="311">It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and used by the Nazis or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did he know that at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: No, of course not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: So they actually mailed -- the entire family, your father, his father, everyone sent...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="322">A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff.</sentence><sentence id="323">They also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff.</sentence><sentence id="324">One of the things that were buried was my father's sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads, because threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the economy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn't come by thread -- you know spools of thread I'm talking about --" so my father took like a box of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the chicken coop.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Did he actually have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: I don't think do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: So they had some notice.</sentence><sentence id="339">When they were told before they're actually deported they were given what?</sentence><sentence id="340">A couple of days or more?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: I don't know how long it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Did all this happen, mail and everything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: No, it had to be more than one day.</sentence><sentence id="349">It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="350">They were told they were being relocated.</sentence><sentence id="351">They weren't told they were being shipped off to north.</sentence><sentence id="352">They were just told they're going to a different <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: So they were burying things because they didn't want to give them up, so they couldn't carry them and they were hoping to return some day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Right, right, right.</sentence><sentence id="361">And of course I guess they believed the story that they were being fed but they all had doubts also.</sentence><sentence id="362">They certainly didn't trust the Hungarian Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="363">And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and digging up stuff.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family members were thinking or saying during these days?</sentence><sentence id="365">Anybody doing anything that stands out in your mind besides burying things?</sentence><sentence id="366">Did anyone try to hide, anyone try to get away?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired.</sentence><sentence id="368">I think it was my father who acquired it.</sentence><sentence id="369">Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort of forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have allowed him to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and move away.</sentence><sentence id="370">But my grandfather wanted the family to stick together.</sentence><sentence id="371">He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to stick together.</sentence><sentence id="372">So they gave the paper to I think a cousin.</sentence><sentence id="373">Actually it was a passport, a Hungarian passport.</sentence><sentence id="374">They gave it to my cousin.</sentence><sentence id="375">Actually this cousin is still alive today.</sentence><sentence id="376">I'll get back to him after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="388">That's not Frank, is it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: So your father actually had a passport which he could have used but his father Adolph persuaded him to give it to his cousin?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: The person who survived, did he survive because of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passport</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: I guess partly.</sentence><sentence id="406">He wasn't deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he sort of increased his chances of survival.</sentence><sentence id="407">We know it's just a question of increasing your chances.</sentence><sentence id="408">You couldn't be really certain that you would survive one way or the other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: Did your father and his family realize at this point that their lives were in fact in danger?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: I don't think they understood the magnitude of the danger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: They were thinking of their property being stolen, being relocated and so forth but did anyone suspect that whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> would in fact be killed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="420">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> was certainly nothing that was known to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: Did anyone hear anything about massacres that had taken place before either in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by word of mouth, did anyone hear of Hungarian soldiers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> returning?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="426">I think that there were some sort of prophets of doom that would come by, Jawotinski I think</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="429">Q: He had died</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: He had died but earlier had come and warned people but he didn't have first-hand information.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: No, I'm talking about 42, deg43, deg44.</sentence><sentence id="434">You know people are being killed by the millions in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">They're Hungarian soldiers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">There are Hungarian Jews who were being sent to work forced labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="437">No one was coming back and telling stories?</sentence></p></dialogue>
