<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Tell us what happened after that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="79">We pushed, uh, into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, uh, forcing, naturally, the German army back, or...or just wiping them out.</sentence><sentence id="80">Uh, I'm making it sound a lot easier than, uh, what actually happened.</sentence><sentence id="81">But, uh, we...the main part is we came to, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">K6ln</span>]; and, uh, then switched, uh, south to, uh, the...one of our armored divisions had captured a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> now know as the <span class="DLF">Remagen Bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">We were immediately pulled out of the fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, and pulled south.</sentence><sentence id="83">And my battalion was the first, uh, of the 99th Division to arrive there.</sentence><sentence id="84">And we went over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that night, under very heavy fire, took the [Epellolai (ph)] on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>--uh, which is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> there--and held it and until other troops could get up there.</sentence><sentence id="85">And we pushed inland, and made what is known as a <span class="DLF">bridgehead</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">It was in this <span class="DLF">bridgehead</span> that we first came upon our first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Tell us about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="99">The army (clearing throat) had never, uh, informed of ...us of anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">Uh, so that we were not mentally prepared for anything.</sentence><sentence id="101">Uh, the first few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, uh, that we came to, we were ordered--being combat troops, our mission was to fight and destroy the German army.</sentence><sentence id="102">So we would part, and go around these huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and re-engage on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">In doing this, we came by...many times, the...one of the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">And here, uh, uh--as I've learned or put together in the last few years--a handful of men would normally be detailed to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, unchain the people who were chained and so on, and release the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="105">Uh, the rest of all the combat troops would, as I say, continue engaging the German troops.</sentence><sentence id="106">As we went by the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, we would see, uh, handfuls, or, uh, quite a few prisoners--or, uh we now call them, survivors--would come outside the <span class="DLF">gates</span> [and] be standing there as we were passing by, either on foot or on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">And they would be waving to you, and they'd be all smiles.</sentence><sentence id="108">And if they got a chance, they'd come over to you and hug and kiss you and shake hands.</sentence><sentence id="109">And this threw us off guard.</sentence><sentence id="110">Because now, when we saw all these smiling faces, we assumed that they were alright.</sentence><sentence id="111">And we just kept on going.</sentence><sentence id="112">The only ones to see any of the horrors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, not... For us, not realizing that many of them were not physically able to come out of the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: The Germans had already left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: The Germans normally, uh, in my experience, uh, would normally stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>--the USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 3 guards--until we were approaching one of the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">And they would withdraw out the back, uh, side, uh, opposite side, of wherever we were approaching.</sentence><sentence id="132">And what L...we've learned is that they would normally take selected prisoners--usually Jewish people--uh, out the <span class="DLF">back gates</span>, and keep on taking them in forced marches, uh, further into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">And they would continue then to try to kill them as fast as they could do that.</sentence><sentence id="134">Uh, we hadn't learned that at this point, uh, there.</sentence><sentence id="135">And so it was a very tragic thing, uh, to be able to permit the Germans to...to keep on murdering people like that. (</sentence><sentence id="136">Clearing throat) They usually beat them to death with rifle butts or...or bayonets, or just shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="137">But they...we also learned that they had to be very careful about not using too much ammunition, because they were going to need that to fight us.</sentence><sentence id="138">So we continued on fighting, continued past the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>--except for our handfuls of men that would go in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: There many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: There were many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like this.</sentence><sentence id="151">And we continued pushing north into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, until we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span> is due east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Remagen</span>].</sentence><sentence id="152">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span>--or in that <span class="REGION">area</span>--uh, my group was selected to, uh...at nighttime, swim the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> [this would have been the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lahne River</span>], come in quietly behind the German guards and the engineers at the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, and quietly take them off.</sentence><sentence id="153">And then cut the, uh, cords to all the explosives on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">At dawn, or about dawn, then our entire regiment or battalion came in on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> quickly; and were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> before the Germans knew it."</sentence><sentence id="155">Now, I was ordered to take my men and go down one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">We fought from <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">But in this <span class="REGION">area</span> was very different from many of the other <span class="REGION">areas</span> in, uh...in Europe--and in particular, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">Because we came upon the most appalling odor that I have ever smelled.</sentence><sentence id="159">And there's no way to really describe it.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh, except to bring out the, uh, important points that, by now, in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> like this we're all very experienced combat troops.</sentence><sentence id="161">We had seen all kinds of human misery.</sentence><sentence id="162">We were used to the odor of death, of, uh, flesh--burning flesh--and all this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="163">But this odor was, uh, very distinct, and very strong.</sentence><sentence id="164">We had to find heavy cloth in the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that we were fighting in, from the German soldiers; and hold it over our faces while we're trying to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="165">Because this...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: How large was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was quite large.</sentence><sentence id="185">Uh, I would compare it, uh, with the size of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malden</span>, Mass[achusetts].</sentence><sentence id="186">Of, uh, say around a 100,000.deg Somewhere on that idea.</sentence><sentence id="187">And, uh, as we pushed down on this particular <span class="REGION">area</span>, why, the odor got worse.</sentence><sentence id="188">And we finally came to a big <span class="DLF">stone wall</span>, and a huge ancient <span class="DLF">wooden gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">Upon top were barbed wire, <span class="BUILDING">machine gun nests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">There was no soldiers there, at this point.</sentence><sentence id="191">Uh, apparently, each time we finally approached deg <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span> was captured March 28, 1945.deg <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span> had a population of 31,601 at the end of the war; by the 1980s its population had grown to 76,374.</sentence><sentence id="192">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*253 4 the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that the guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> would not engage us.</sentence><sentence id="193">They would run instead.</sentence><sentence id="194">Unlike the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wehrmacht</span> or the regular infantry.</sentence><sentence id="195">So, when we came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, we knew we had some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="196">And we put TNT against the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, and we blew it in.</sentence><sentence id="197">Ran <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, dispersed to cover each other, and engage what we knew would be the, uh, the Death["s]- Head--from experience, the Death's] -Head SS troopers" uh, that normally ran these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="8.05">Hadamar</span>."</sentence><sentence id="199">Uh, it turned out to be, uh, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>, not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>."</sentence><sentence id="200">Uh, why I say that is because they weren't keeping the prisoners there for long periods of time and starving them and tormenting them and torturing them and terrorizing them, like in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that we would go into.</sentence><sentence id="201">As we burst into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and spread out, I saw in front of me a row of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wooden</span>, one-story <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">In front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, at that point, was a large group of...what we called in those days "slaves," for lack of any other word.</sentence><sentence id="204">Now we call them survivors.</sentence><sentence id="205">And they were standing there totally shocked at, of course, the explosion of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> being blown in, these strange men in strange uniforms running in.</sentence><sentence id="206">And they didn't know who we were.</sentence><sentence id="207">Uh, I since learned, of course, that the Germans kept all the information, news, away from them.</sentence><sentence id="208">So that...thus not ever giving them any hope of surviving.</sentence><sentence id="209">I knew that these people were of no danger to us; so I immediately, being combat, turned my attention to the left, to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And I ordered my men to start going through the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and start cleaning them out--in other words, engaging the German soldier, the SS troopers.</sentence><sentence id="211">Uh, at that point, one of my men came for me.</sentence><sentence id="212">And he asked me...he says, "You'd better come with me."</sentence><sentence id="213">And he had a voice...his tone of voice was very serious.</sentence><sentence id="214">I followed him across the <span class="DLF">yard</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>;
