<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: -- to your childhood.</sentence><sentence id="243">Things like that happened, but it sounds to me rather unusual, because many army officers, many professional military men were actually arrested by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="244">So how is it that he wasn't -- not only not it -- wasn't he arrested, but he becomes a military officer in the Soviet army?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Well, because he never was involved in politics.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Yes, because we always have to make new friends.</sentence><sentence id="285">So it's just kind of different, but we -- we adapted to that very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="286">It didn't really bother us.</sentence><sentence id="287">Because essentially we moved -- we really moved with the army, you know, it wasn't like a new job or something.</sentence><sentence id="288">It was just o-officer being moved to a -- getting another assignment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: In a different <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
