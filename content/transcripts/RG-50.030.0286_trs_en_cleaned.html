<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> Belgium in December 1936.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: So you were very young at the time before the war.</sentence><sentence id="6">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son.</sentence><sentence id="10">I remember the feeling of going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl.</sentence><sentence id="11">That's what I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: You had a comfortable family life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="18">I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs.</sentence><sentence id="19">We couldn't be without one another.</sentence><sentence id="20">So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="21">She loved the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dolls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">That's what I remember.</sentence><sentence id="23">I remember being very comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="24">I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family.</sentence><sentence id="25">I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man.</sentence><sentence id="26">He used to tell me stories.</sentence><sentence id="27">That's basically all I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Now what kind of business was your father in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="42">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort.</sentence><sentence id="43">He was very, very religious.</sentence><sentence id="44">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="45">He was always going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, coming from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and praying an awful lot.</sentence><sentence id="46">In my head it seemed like too much.</sentence><sentence id="47">It seemed like not a very tense life.</sentence><sentence id="48">He was going to work and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we observed the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="49">We would always go for walks in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and things of that sort.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity.</sentence><sentence id="68">I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="74">The ones I knew.</sentence><sentence id="75">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="80">Do you have any images of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat.</sentence><sentence id="84">When he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then.</sentence><sentence id="86">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think.</sentence><sentence id="87">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> said you are this little girl who said that.</sentence><sentence id="88">They remember that statement.</sentence><sentence id="89">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: I don't think he said anything.</sentence><sentence id="100">He didn't say anything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Did you ever have to wear the Star of David?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes, I did.</sentence><sentence id="106">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, and we had to wear the star.</sentence><sentence id="107">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">She'd always do that, carry me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="114">Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and being petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the distance and dragging and running through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog.</sentence><sentence id="122">So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog.</sentence><sentence id="123">I couldn't go in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would just freeze.</sentence><sentence id="124">I would completely decompensate so I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="125">I don't remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> per se.</sentence><sentence id="126">I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified.</sentence><sentence id="127">I remember that march through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and ending up in some abandoned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="128">I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming.</sentence><sentence id="142">They finally left.</sentence><sentence id="143">They ransacked the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they were looking for money and so on.</sentence><sentence id="144">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: These were just Belgium police?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity.</sentence><sentence id="153">They might have just done that.</sentence><sentence id="154">This was a good time to do that.</sentence><sentence id="155">I mean it was perfectly acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with the idea of trying to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">If I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French camps</span> &gt;&gt; Was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that they went to.</sentence><sentence id="158">I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that period my friends and I went to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that we were hidden in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused.</sentence><sentence id="167">Now you had mentioned that your father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: This was before you went out into hiding into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>?</sentence><sentence id="173">I'm trying to get the sequence here.</sentence><sentence id="174">If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too.</sentence><sentence id="175">I mean that I know that you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice.</sentence><sentence id="184">The first time we might have gone all of us together to in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and that must have been "40, "41 somewhere around there.</sentence><sentence id="185">And then we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">I think subsequently the men went to work again to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: Which was called?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: or something like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: This was near I think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Yes, in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="198">And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then we left I think that's when we went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, but we didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="199">So, and we got caught that time.</sentence><sentence id="200">The first time we were simply sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transient camps</span> which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="202">I don't know how much my parents knew of what these <span class="NPIP">places</span> were going to lead to.</sentence><sentence id="203">I'm not sure they really knew.</sentence><sentence id="204">At some point they heard that people who left there never got back.</sentence><sentence id="205">I mean that through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> they were at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Now, as I understand it, the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they went to was ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Were you in that at all with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: No, I think that when they were transferred to they had made some arrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were, my friends and I in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> near :</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Tell me a little bit about the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, who was there, what was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there until they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16.</sentence><sentence id="226">I think the oldest were 16 to 17.</sentence><sentence id="227">There was a mixture.</sentence><sentence id="228">They were all refugee children.</sentence><sentence id="229">Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was very close to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">It's in the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that borders on <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> almost so the catholic archdiocese of that <span class="REGION">area</span> had taken in some children from that war and kept all of them together in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: So, this was a <span class="BUILDING">catholic home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: It was a catholic run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to channel some of their kids into that particular <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born in "36 and that must have been "42, "43 somewhere around there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: How long were you in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: In this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Tell me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger.</sentence><sentence id="255">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing.</sentence><sentence id="256">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food.</sentence><sentence id="257">So, I used to run to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night.</sentence><sentence id="258">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother.</sentence><sentence id="259">So, we were quite a pair.</sentence><sentence id="260">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow.</sentence><sentence id="261">I just couldn't swallow any food there.</sentence><sentence id="262">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair.</sentence><sentence id="263">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching.</sentence><sentence id="264">I hid in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">There was no indoor plumbing.</sentence><sentence id="266">There was indoor cold water to wash but no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">I hid in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head.</sentence><sentence id="268">So, but they eventually did.</sentence><sentence id="269">I had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="270">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible.</sentence><sentence id="271">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape.</sentence><sentence id="272">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible.</sentence><sentence id="273">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically.</sentence><sentence id="274">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught.</sentence><sentence id="275">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="276">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks.</sentence><sentence id="277">I can't even look at the stuff.</sentence><sentence id="278">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off.</sentence><sentence id="279">That's all we had.</sentence><sentence id="280">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What was a normal day like in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="309">What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: As little as possible.</sentence><sentence id="316">I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I must have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed.</sentence><sentence id="317">I couldn't do much of anything.</sentence><sentence id="318">We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00 and we lined up.</sentence><sentence id="319">I don't know if you saw the several films about <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span>, <span class="BUILDING">catholic homes</span> I think is one of them where children just line up and they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer.</sentence><sentence id="320">They used to pray but we sort of didn't pray along.</sentence><sentence id="321">I believe that there were some kind of organized games, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of instructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount.</sentence><sentence id="322">I just don't remember anything that was organized.</sentence><sentence id="323">There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel when I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically.</sentence><sentence id="324">That was that.</sentence><sentence id="325">We had to make our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we had to help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">We had to peel the few potatoes there were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was.</sentence><sentence id="327">We had to help clean up and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="328">There was nothing else going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: Was it crowded?</sentence><sentence id="344">Did you sleep in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> with a lot of other kids?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="348">There were two <span class="REGION">areas</span>, there as a <span class="REGION">female area</span> and there was a <span class="REGION">male area</span>, boys and girls.</sentence><sentence id="349">We were lined up like in the old <span class="INT_SPACE">hospital wards</span>, a number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> together one next to another.</sentence><sentence id="350">We had essentially no possessions.</sentence><sentence id="351">We didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="352">We just had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes.</sentence><sentence id="353">I mean I don't think I had anything.</sentence><sentence id="354">Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I don't remember having a <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> I could call my own you know with my stuff.</sentence><sentence id="355">I had nothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: How many kids were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="368">I'd say 100 or so, not more than that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Were the people who took care of you nice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell.</sentence><sentence id="374">I was just so unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="375">I don't have good feelings about anybody there, but it may not be them.</sentence><sentence id="376">I don't remember-- for instance, this incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this.</sentence><sentence id="377">I felt that this was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with the lice.</sentence><sentence id="378">SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't.</sentence><sentence id="379">I don't remember anybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they probably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="380">I know for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was told.</sentence><sentence id="381">It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it.</sentence><sentence id="382">I would continuously argue and fight scream run a way.</sentence><sentence id="383">So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional to handle a child of that condition and they weren't.</sentence><sentence id="384">I assume they were volunteers from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I can't say that there was somebody there that was nice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there?</sentence><sentence id="404">What were the circumstances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="409">Q: How did your parents get out of ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere else and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say goodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> during that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="412">So, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to yesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the money and left and told us how to get there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Were you the oldest?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="422">And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and getting off <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and somehow getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>, but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made it.</sentence><sentence id="423">My recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had at least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with three children.</sentence><sentence id="424">She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice and the scabs.</sentence><sentence id="425">We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="426">We had grown up pretty quickly, and we got there.</sentence><sentence id="427">We simply made the rondevoux with our parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a dream, but it is true.</sentence><sentence id="429">We did get there and we did find our parents.</sentence><sentence id="430">But I then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> it actually was a very happy period.</sentence><sentence id="431">It sounds also crazy but we were living in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and in the same <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="432">They were not too interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government.</sentence><sentence id="433">I remember them giving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them.</sentence><sentence id="434">I mean they were just very lovely people.</sentence><sentence id="435">And we were together but the remnants of that previous experience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming even though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible.</sentence><sentence id="436">But that stands out as a nice time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> because we were all together and we would go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present.</sentence><sentence id="437">As a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age.</sentence><sentence id="438">We were together and we were having a good time.</sentence><sentence id="439">I could not imagine that first of all things would get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full time solution to the problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="465">Q: I don't understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="468">But Italian, not German.</sentence><sentence id="469">The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="473">Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else.</sentence><sentence id="476">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased.</sentence><sentence id="477">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="478">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not.</sentence><sentence id="479">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background.</sentence><sentence id="480">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less.</sentence><sentence id="481">I mean they just did not round up people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: Do you remember about how long you were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="495">A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that had previously been occupied by the Italians.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: When was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: The end of --must have been the beginning of "44 or somewhere around there, I think.</sentence><sentence id="500">The war was over in "45 and we were in for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 or so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that.</sentence><sentence id="501">At that point the news spread rather quickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in various other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run and again try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> the second time around.</sentence><sentence id="502">Things moved very quickly so it also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they would be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being bothered or had a better chance.</sentence><sentence id="503">So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two little friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave the men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public</sentence><sentence id="505"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span> but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us.</sentence><sentence id="506">From there we were going to try and get through to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="507">So, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I don't know if we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or I don't know where we stayed exactly.</sentence><sentence id="508">In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">They had found someone who was going to drive an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and take them as being ill.</sentence><sentence id="510">So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we had stayed.</sentence><sentence id="511">My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his , and when he got to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> the Germans were there.</sentence><sentence id="512">So, he didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="513">They arrested him.</sentence><sentence id="514">Apparently Mr. waited until the evening and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up.</sentence><sentence id="515">So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were.</sentence><sentence id="516">And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone.</sentence><sentence id="517">She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong.</sentence><sentence id="518">I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart.</sentence><sentence id="519">We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least.</sentence><sentence id="520">The woman had her parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and so they decided to really push on and try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore.</sentence><sentence id="521">She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in , which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we were at.</sentence><sentence id="522">At that point we got papers from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers.</sentence><sentence id="523">So, we changed our name again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="552">Q: To a French name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="554">A: A French name so my name was . [</sentence><sentence id="555">had one or two names in between but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you are no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to yourself until you actually believe that you are this other person.</sentence><sentence id="556">It gets extremely confusing.</sentence><sentence id="557">At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean I was very angry.</sentence><sentence id="558">At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were -- actually it was owned by the people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above.</sentence><sentence id="559">The first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was inhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="560">They had become French, but they were German Jews originally, and then we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was not really a real <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> but just under the <span class="DLF">roof</span> where the <span class="DLF">roof</span> actually meets the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">It's called , like an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic apartment</span> essentially.</sentence><sentence id="562">I don't know if we had three or four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there, but really two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> maybe, just two <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, one which was an everything room and one which was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">We stayed there pretty much to the end of the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the resistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and also harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="564">She would provide them with <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and with food and when they left they left their papers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food.</sentence><sentence id="565">So, at that point, we were really</sentence><sentence id="567">0 wealthy in terms of food availability.</sentence><sentence id="568">It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a street child.</sentence><sentence id="569">I did whatever I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="570">I was supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I never did.</sentence><sentence id="571">I mean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst characters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were pretty mild.</sentence><sentence id="572">But we just would go and hide and play.</sentence><sentence id="573">We'd play three musketeers and we'd play all these fighting games.</sentence><sentence id="574">I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I just never showed up, and when I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="575">But I learned how to read by myself.</sentence><sentence id="576">Two things I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="577">I was reading voraciously.</sentence><sentence id="578">I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading.</sentence><sentence id="579">I just simply didn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="580">I was just reading books and books.</sentence><sentence id="581">Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it was.</sentence><sentence id="582">It could have been the phone book.</sentence><sentence id="583">It didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="584">It was an escape, you know, and I could just not be in the present.</sentence><sentence id="585">It was away from everything.</sentence><sentence id="586">I had another friend then who lived nearby.</sentence><sentence id="587">I was friends with all the village kids, basically.</sentence><sentence id="588">Then, the people who were renting us the <span class="NPIP">place</span> were very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="589">They were French, but they pretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="590">They never questioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with them on Sundays because it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up.</sentence><sentence id="591">And my mother's French was not great.</sentence><sentence id="592">It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had really become completely fluent from that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was perfectly fluent so I could pass for French kid easily.</sentence><sentence id="593">They thought it would be a good idea for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up.</sentence><sentence id="594">I was quite taken by that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">service</span>.</sentence><sentence id="595">As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was something very comforting about the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the priests and there was a very safe feeling in that big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the way the voices resounded.</sentence><sentence id="596">That I remember that feeling for the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">Now, I hate the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span>, but I really felt very comforted by that whole atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="598">The daughter of the people who were renting the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to us had her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious.</sentence><sentence id="599">They wore this white dress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all these things.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="651">A: Oh, I knew that going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group you were okay.</sentence><sentence id="652">So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another group.</sentence><sentence id="653">I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was.</sentence><sentence id="654">And, as I said, I was really very angry and I was very nasty.</sentence><sentence id="655">One of the people that my mother had taken in in the meantime until they got someone to take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was extremely fearful for good reasons and was not leaving the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="656">I mean it was just really sequestered and would not go out.</sentence><sentence id="657">My mother was circulating freely with her fake papers.</sentence><sentence id="658">I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French was not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="659">I certainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were absolutely petrified.</sentence><sentence id="660">He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had curfews where we had all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and so on, and I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> supposedly from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my</sentence><sentence id="662">1 lungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up.</sentence><sentence id="663">I had this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="664">You could see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="665">I convinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find.</sentence><sentence id="666">I also knew this wasn't true, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened.</sentence><sentence id="667">I mean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and screaming, you come there and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you.</sentence><sentence id="668">He would come, you know, he would just come.</sentence><sentence id="669">He didn't know what to say.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="693">A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="694">But deep inside I knew this was just really not true, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers and he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="695">He would have been picked up very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="696">In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty, very nasty things.</sentence><sentence id="697">They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want basically.</sentence><sentence id="698">I'm not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="699">I can just do whatever.</sentence><sentence id="700">Nobody can tell me what to do.</sentence><sentence id="701">There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone, and I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were alarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible.</sentence><sentence id="702">They were just just horrible.</sentence><sentence id="703">I would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> by myself.</sentence><sentence id="704">I was afraid to get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> by myself.</sentence><sentence id="705">I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd go together.</sentence><sentence id="706">So, when she wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but then to go back to my <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">I mean she didn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people.</sentence><sentence id="708">You don't know.</sentence><sentence id="709">They could put a trace on her.</sentence><sentence id="710">She was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">She was getting watches and she was then going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and she was selling them.</sentence><sentence id="712">She was doing all sorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell me either.</sentence><sentence id="713">She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, that's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever was going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and knowing that that certainly was not really good.</sentence><sentence id="714">I was really scared, I mean really, really scared.</sentence></p></dialogue>

and so we lived in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I remember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he was having the worse

was just overcome by such fear that I would just scream by myself in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my neighbor upstairs would come and get me.</sentence><sentence id="1020">I was trying.</sentence><sentence id="1021">I always said, sure you can go.</sentence><sentence id="1022">I'm fine.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I'm great, no problem.</sentence><sentence id="1024">As soon

id="1027">I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke French beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I developed a very nice

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1235">A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past.</sentence><sentence id="1236">So, it's hard for me to say now.</sentence><sentence id="1237">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I just didn't know where anybody was.</sentence><sentence id="1238">And then when my dad was taken.</sentence><sentence id="1239">These were just terrible, terrible moments.</sentence><sentence id="1240">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him.</sentence><sentence id="1241">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job.</sentence><sentence id="1242">I couldn't even appreciate any of this.</sentence><sentence id="1243">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1244">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died.</sentence><sentence id="1245">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1246">When he died, I said okay that's over.</sentence><sentence id="1247">He's really gone and he's not coming back.</sentence><sentence id="1248">That's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1272">A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general.</sentence><sentence id="1273">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like or that type of think.</sentence><sentence id="1274">I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being in that he lives his religion.</sentence><sentence id="1275">This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and his children, his family.</sentence><sentence id="1276">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> because that's the only place where he can be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's a deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see and rebel against which is the things that I rebel against.</sentence><sentence id="1277">You can't go here, things that look totally idiotic to me.</sentence><sentence id="1278">It's a lot easier to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> let's say for a person my mother's age and condition than to walk upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="1279">That kind of thing, but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend.</sentence><sentence id="1280">People know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend.</sentence><sentence id="1281">But I have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on high holidays only because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1282">I'm proud of them.</sentence><sentence id="1283">But not in terms of observing the things that I consider interfering with the conduct of modern life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1296">Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span> and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism, some felt irrelevant.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1300">Q: Or they had been abandoned by it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about my grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which I mean this is a logical question to ask.</sentence><sentence id="1303">Where are your angels, and there's no logical answer to that.</sentence><sentence id="1304">So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that whole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1305">That's one of the things I resented when my dad came back.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I embraced catholicism only because it represented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or anything like that, didn't appeal to me very much.</sentence><sentence id="1307">What appealed to me really was the ritual and not the content.</sentence><sentence id="1308">What appeals to me in <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span> really is more the content and not the ritual.</sentence><sentence id="1309">The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't hide that anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1310">Perhaps if I were in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where nobody observed anything I would do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel that I have to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1311">But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that after the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span></sentence><sentence id="1313">0 and so on and we stayed friends for a while after.</sentence><sentence id="1314">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle.</sentence><sentence id="1315">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle.</sentence><sentence id="1316">We could just not do pray or do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1317">Then when I went to study, I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1318">I didn't even go <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1319">I stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the entire time, but I was there.</sentence><sentence id="1320">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me.</sentence><sentence id="1321">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="1322">I really don't believe in that at all.</sentence><sentence id="1323">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being.</sentence><sentence id="1324">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
