<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A:Yeah, L...1 was the only.</sentence><sentence id="249">I had to help out.</sentence><sentence id="250">We had a little money and we had things that my father accumulated and we lived on that.</sentence><sentence id="251">We didn't live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet so we lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">My mother and I, we used to do little bit knitting and sew and make a little bit money with it, you know?</sentence><sentence id="253">That's the only thing my mother knew how to do is to knit very well.</sentence><sentence id="254">So she used to knit for the Polish people, for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="255">They used to give her sugar for it, eggs.</sentence><sentence id="256">And then we could exchange this for other things.</sentence><sentence id="257">So things weren't too bad.</sentence><sentence id="258">And then I had two Polish families who were customers, my father's customers.</sentence><sentence id="259">And they really came forward with helping us, while we were.... One wife, one baker who had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery shop</span>, you know, <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>.... She used to put everyday behind the <span class="DLF">fence</span> where they had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, a loaf of bread and a bag of coal--they used to bake with the wood and the coal--and a little bag with the flour, every day, and we picked it up.</sentence><sentence id="260">That was a fortune, because half we sold and could buy other things and half we used for ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="261">And then we had another one who later saved our lives.</sentence><sentence id="262">He used to help us out also a lot.</sentence><sentence id="263">He was very upset that they killed my father.</sentence><sentence id="264">He said, "If they killed your father, they took my luck</sentence><sentence id="266"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*184 5 away."</sentence><sentence id="267">He believed so strongly in my father.</sentence><sentence id="268">We were very closely friends with this one.</sentence><sentence id="269">The children were close.</sentence><sentence id="270">The parents were close.</sentence><sentence id="271">We didn't...my...he didn't do nothing with...there goes back a story, which I'll get back to it later, how that relationship started.</sentence><sentence id="272">But he helped us survive, too; which was much easier than other families because if they had <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and they had goods and that, they had to give up everything.</sentence><sentence id="273">You had to give up.</sentence><sentence id="274">You had to give up if you any forks...you had to give up if you had any silver, you had to give up if you had any gold.</sentence><sentence id="275">And the money was worthless.</sentence><sentence id="276">So the only way you could survive if you had something to exchange.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q:When did it start to get very bad?</sentence><sentence id="319">What happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="322">Ault started to get very bad the beginning of "41, when they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="323">They made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>; and all of a sudden they...uh...decided that all the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> have to move into one <span class="NPIP">section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">And they had to leave...we had to leave, like in a couple of hours.</sentence><sentence id="325">You could take only what you could take on your...back or in your hands.</sentence><sentence id="326">And they put us in with a woman with six children, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">And my mother wasn't a well woman, all those years that I can remember.</sentence><sentence id="328">And she couldn't...the poor woman couldn't sleep and she</sentence><sentence id="330">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*184 6 couldn't...and she says, "I cannot stand it in..." You know, with my father gone, she lost a lot of will to live, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="331">And we decided, being we had family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">At that time it wasn't a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="333">It was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">So they let us know that we should come there.</sentence><sentence id="335">There's no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">And we could stay there with them.</sentence><sentence id="337">There's plenty.</sentence><sentence id="338">So we packed up and we went, and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszce</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">And there, it wasn't so bad.</sentence><sentence id="340">My brother worked in the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="341">And if he worked night shift, he used to steal some flour and some...uh... what's it called?</sentence><sentence id="342">Cream of wheat.</sentence><sentence id="343">You know?</sentence><sentence id="344">He used to put it in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> behind the milk, and I used to go and pick it up at night.</sentence><sentence id="345">And it wasn't too bad.</sentence><sentence id="346">Once in awhile the gendarmerie--not the real Gestapo--used to come, and they would rob and they would steal.</sentence><sentence id="347">They would take away whatever you had, but you could live.</sentence><sentence id="348">And we stayed there until...and then they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span>, and again a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">So we moved in also with an old lady in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">But at that time I guess my mother got used to the conditions, and I guess the circumstances made her stronger and healthier, that she could go on.</sentence><sentence id="351">I don't know how, but she did.</sentence><sentence id="352">And we stayed...we used to go both to work, my brother and I. And she remained at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> hidden.</sentence><sentence id="353">In the evening she came out and we were together.</sentence><sentence id="354">In the morning, the same thing; and that... that almost a year we were there with her.</sentence><sentence id="355">And then we heard that in May of 1942, they started with the Judenrein, you know, all of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">I don't know about Europe, but I, ah...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q:Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="395">Do you mean Judenrat or Judenrein?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A:Judenrein.</sentence><sentence id="399">Judenrein.</sentence><sentence id="400">Judenrats, they were all over in the meanwhile.</sentence><sentence id="401">Judenrein.</sentence><sentence id="402">And my aunt...and we knew that we're not gonna stay too much longer.</sentence><sentence id="403">So my mother's sisters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m</span>, which remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m</span>, let us know if they should take us young--like my brother and myself--to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, Mom should come to them, because they believed they're</sentence><sentence id="405">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*184 7 gonna be there over the winter and maybe.... So we left my mother... and all of a sudden one morning, you know, they didn't warn you or they didn't prepare you, one morning you're going away.</sentence><sentence id="406">So we packed up whatever we could, and my mother we hid; and she said at night she will go out, and she'll find a way to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Che_m back</span> to be with the family-- because they told us that no older people...older people...she was probably 40 or 41 cannot go...just young people.</sentence><sentence id="407">The people who worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">So my brother and I left, and it seems that my mother couldn't get in touch with her sisters because in the meanwhile they took them.</sentence><sentence id="409">They took everybody at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="410">And she got tired of sitting.</sentence><sentence id="411">That we found out after the war.</sentence><sentence id="412">Somebody who survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span>, that she went over to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and ask them they should shoot her and they shot her.</sentence><sentence id="413">That was the end.</sentence><sentence id="414">We didn't find out "til after the war.</sentence><sentence id="415">And my brother and I, we started our march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siedliszcze</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">We didn't know, but it was to start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowosiolki</span>, what I told you.</sentence><sentence id="417">You know?And I had a bundle and I grabbed whatever I could...new things and old things, because we felt...my mother said, "Take it.</sentence><sentence id="418">Maybe you'll be able to exchange for some....".</sentence><sentence id="419">You know in Europe, like my mother...she had old linen from my brother, and everything for the dowry in case....
