<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is David Pollack.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prince Albert</span>, <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>, in 1922.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me something about your parents and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which you grew up please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: My father came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> in 1913 from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">He was an indentured worker.</sentence><sentence id="15">Someone paid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked the man who had brought him over to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> where with $300 he could buy a <span class="BUILDING">business building</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to bring in his fiancee.</sentence><sentence id="16">They only place in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> where that would qualify was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of 400 people then and I think 400 people now, where there happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> overhead and the whole thing including my mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300.</sentence><sentence id="17">So my brother and sister and I were born and brought up in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Saskatchewan</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: What was it like growing up in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: It was very healthy.</sentence><sentence id="26">It was a simple childhood.</sentence><sentence id="27">You, you were concerned with the weather and wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">Most of it wasn't actually sold.</sentence><sentence id="29">Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's when I remember the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs and and roots so they would dig up herbs.</sentence><sentence id="31">I remember one called seneca root (ph) which you could make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these things and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and my father would send these things then on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prince Albert</span> which was then a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> we would call it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span> and my sister when she graduated from <span class="BUILDING">grade 12</span> was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there were none in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">We were the only Jewish family there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: What was it like to be the only Jewish family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal.</sentence><sentence id="44">Everybody was the only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever.</sentence><sentence id="45">People had to get along.</sentence><sentence id="46">There was no fire system.</sentence><sentence id="47">There was no police system.</sentence><sentence id="48">There was a municipal doctor, which meant he had an enormous <span class="REGION">territory</span> to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to revive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed.</sentence><sentence id="49">People of course couldn't eliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell me you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't really know what that meant until I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> at age 17 to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span>, which was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saskatoon</span>, and I really have not encountered anti- Semitism in my life.</sentence><sentence id="50">I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's been minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms.</sentence><sentence id="51">I guess because of my childhood, so I knew I was Jewish but I didn't really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me.</sentence><sentence id="52">And certainly doesn't trouble me today.</sentence><sentence id="53">01:04</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: You went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">Was that: a radical change for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="70">It was a big change because this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span>, had minimal infrastructure.</sentence><sentence id="71">It had no running water.</sentence><sentence id="72">It had outdoor <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> and in twenty below and thirty below and forty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this day.</sentence><sentence id="73">Electricity came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> when I was in <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">Before that we studied with coal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as television of course.</sentence><sentence id="75">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> were poor.</sentence><sentence id="76">We had no newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="77">So <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was an amazing change as the studies let alone the city of Saskatoon was a major change for me.</sentence><sentence id="78">So I spent two years there and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it was, as we now would call it, it was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the the Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies.</sentence><sentence id="79">I might just say a word about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">Since <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> is a very large province, peopled, dotted with tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlets</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high holidays in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services without a rabbi but with a local cantor.</sentence><sentence id="81">And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one Jewish woman's house and they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">So although each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a sense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything.</sentence><sentence id="83">I was bar mitzvahed but it was rather odd.</sentence><sentence id="84">My father sent me to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> twenty-five miles away every Friday night to memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="85">I didn't know what I was saying but I said it.</sentence><sentence id="86">My dad and mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of Jewishness but it was an arms-length sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="107">You enlisted in the army when?</sentence><sentence id="108">In what <span class="NPIP">year</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: I enlisted in the Air Force in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="113">I was then 20.</sentence><sentence id="114">I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't actually enter until I was 20.</sentence><sentence id="115">And I spent the first year and a half in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">I enlisted in Air Crew but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't good, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in Air Crew and then couldn't make it for reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret world of radar.</sentence><sentence id="117">The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit more exciting than being ground crew and just repairing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air planes</span> and doing ground duties.</sentence><sentence id="118">So I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much.</sentence><sentence id="119">My mind works along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study and sent to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> off the west coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at the southern point of the Queen Charlottes.</sentence><sentence id="120">There's there's an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> about the size of a <span class="DLF">city block</span> on which the Canadian's authority, military authorities, had put a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">From <span class="REGION">Alaska</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baca</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">California</span>, the Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ships</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, if they came towards the <span class="DLF">coast</span>, would be spotted by this radar system.</sentence><sentence id="122">And the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of <span class="DLF">radar networks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">And I was the junior of two officers.</sentence><sentence id="124">I was what is called a pilot officer.</sentence><sentence id="125">It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd Lieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of 1st Lieutenant's rank, and I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system.</sentence><sentence id="126">We had 40 young Canadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a rock in the middle of the <span class="REGION">Pacific Ocean</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">No women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="128">Just a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">It wasn't, it wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be.</sentence><sentence id="130">Nothing every happened.</sentence><sentence id="131">The Japanese didn't come so it was boring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational efficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I know because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they didn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar.</sentence><sentence id="132">They talked about other more basic things.</sentence><sentence id="133">Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I volunteered to go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> and so | arrived <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> and spent about a year in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> before D Day.</sentence><sentence id="134">My work in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was mostly on radar-controlled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">We were trying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the V-l bombs by radar and also of course when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German bombers</span> would come over.</sentence><sentence id="136">And also I spent six months in the North 01:10 Sea out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yarmouth</span> on what were called HSL's - high speed launches.</sentence><sentence id="137">The RAF and the American Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the RAF or attached to the RAF, would go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these fights over the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and when one of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air craft</span> was shot down, if someone in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, that person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">launches</span>, and then send a a message by radio - there's an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> down or going down in your quadrant.</sentence><sentence id="138">try and find it.</sentence><sentence id="139">And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards where he thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> might be.</sentence><sentence id="140">If it became dusk and we were getting close then it would be my job to turn on the radar which had a very high frequency low scan so that we could we could see into the water's edge and the job was to find these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and pick up the pilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity.</sentence><sentence id="141">They were being shot down so quickly by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Luftwaffe</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="142">So for about a year I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> doing these things on the <span class="REGION">land</span> with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> trying to find <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and and pilots in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifeboats</span> with my radar.</sentence><sentence id="143">And that was my job until D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week or ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> with a mobile radar unit to set up a <span class="BUILDING">mobile transmitting station</span> as close as possible to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">The reasoning was as follows.</sentence><sentence id="145">Radar was very primitive 45 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="146">Instead of having chips and the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them bottles, big tubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs.</sentence><sentence id="147">I mean you'd need a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> this size to power the transmitters in those days because they were so primitive.</sentence><sentence id="148">So inefficient.</sentence><sentence id="149">That being the case the closer the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radar unit</span> was to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that they were sending their impulses to the more accurate they'd be.</sentence><sentence id="150">I guess I should just explain that word impulse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: That's OK.</sentence><sentence id="192">I mean here we...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Well but it might explain what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="196">The Americans were bombing <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by daylight with a bombsight called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norden</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="197">You actually looked down and the bombardier controlled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in the run in over the target.</sentence><sentence id="198">You looked at the target and twiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">So the Americans would bomb <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in daytime.</sentence><sentence id="200">The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the 01:14: Australians and the New Zeelanders attached to the RAF bombed at night.</sentence><sentence id="201">And the way they could see see in quote marks the target was as follows.</sentence><sentence id="202">The heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> the Blenheims (ph) and the Wellingtons the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> carrying the bombs would go out in units of I think it was ten or twenty.</sentence><sentence id="203">And in between waves of the heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> would one or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that were called mosquitoes.</sentence><sentence id="204">They were made out of plywood and they flew at thirty thousand feet at three hundred miles an hour.</sentence><sentence id="205">They had no bombs.</sentence><sentence id="206">They had a radar set that you could see and hear and from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> we would control that navigator in the mosquito such that when he came Over for example the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, we'd press a button, knowing~ where he was on our screen on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">He could hear and see what the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped - not a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a parachute, and that~ thermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop "x" thousand feet above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and remain suspended in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> would come over and bomb the thermite flare.</sentence><sentence id="208">So you had had what was called twenty-four hour service.</sentence><sentence id="209">The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar controlling the British night bombing.</sentence><sentence id="210">And the farther you were from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that you were sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get distortions on the screen or in the headset.</sentence><sentence id="211">So that's why they sent our mobile teams across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> after D-Day to get closer and closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> so that we could guide the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night bombers</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> while the Russians were coming in from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">So I was sent with this <span class="BUILDING">mobile radar unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people, with the with the radar equipment, and we set course towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> - I don't remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span> - A - A - C - H- E- N. [remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dueren</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="215">I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and I certainly remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mons</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where we bivouacked.</sentence><sentence id="216">And we were on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor cycle</span>, an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> with my flight sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="217">I was all of 23 then.</sentence><sentence id="218">1945.</sentence><sentence id="219">And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and he said you guys ever seen a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="220">I had heard the phrase, but I thought being rather ideologically simplistic - I was from the prairies.</sentence><sentence id="221">I had had two years at <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and then I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things.</sentence><sentence id="222">I'd read whatever newspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their propaganda system, and we had stories about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't really given much thought.</sentence><sentence id="223">I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase.</sentence><sentence id="224">And the American said its "x" kilometers down the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">And that's how I came to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if my memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, | think.</sentence><sentence id="227">But that's how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Tell me your impressions as you walked through the <span class="DLF">gates</span>?</sentence><sentence id="264">What did you see?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: Well, there were inmates milling around.</sentence><sentence id="268">There were some soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="269">The inmates, there was a triage system under way.</sentence><sentence id="270">Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or those who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">Those that seemed quite in decent health, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:0 to look at them and see what they could do.</sentence><sentence id="272">I saw the piles of, of dead bodies.</sentence><sentence id="273">They were stacked in the way you stack beer bottles in the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">You know, you put the head and then the bottom of the bottle, and then the front of the bottle and the rear of the bottle so that you can, they'll s1.ack without rolling over.</sentence><sentence id="275">They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so that you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a pile.</sentence><sentence id="276">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> with one of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> open and the remains of a body in it.</sentence><sentence id="277">There were scaffolding and piles of bones and of course the inmates themselves.</sentence><sentence id="278">I went into one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where a number of men were lying on lhe <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which was very dirty with excrement.</sentence><sentence id="279">I was then smoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper cover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the stench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> signaled for ;I cigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I didn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out the three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver foil.</sentence><sentence id="280">I guess it represented something of value after years of no value.</sentence><sentence id="281">It was a very, very disturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because it seemed to have some value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those who had strength.</sentence><sentence id="282">They, I took photographs.</sentence><sentence id="283">I took a number of photographs, which I've given to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span>, of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span>, of the <span class="DLF">scaffolding</span> where they would hang people, of the bones, of the people stacked on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and being carted away in some kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or horse-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">I don't remember which.</sentence><sentence id="285">I remember that the men's thighs were so thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there.</sentence><sentence id="286">The flesh had literally melted away.</sentence><sentence id="287">You could put your hand around the tops of their arms.</sentence><sentence id="288">Their faces were this wax, this yellow waxy face.</sentence><sentence id="289">The skin W21S drawn so tightly around the skulls that they almost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them.</sentence><sentence id="290">It was a very shocking sight.particularly my sergeant threw up.</sentence><sentence id="291">I didn't throw up.</sentence><sentence id="292">I guess it was because it came as such an amazing blow you might say.</sentence><sentence id="293">I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic.</sentence><sentence id="294">I had never thought about such things happening.</sentence><sentence id="295">They hadn't entered my my mind in <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> and in the early years of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then drinking beer and going out with women.</sentence><sentence id="296">I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies of government and the racial thesis and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="297">So it

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="544">Q: What happened, this communication obviously this has gone on for all these many years.</sentence><sentence id="545">Let us go back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="548">A: Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor.</sentence><sentence id="549">I had, had two years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span>, and then was given a scholarship to study at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis, and then was offered a, a, a job with the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction Development here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the <span class="BUILDING">United Nations Secretariat</span> and had a thirty year career in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mexico City</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santiago</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="550">Then I came back thirty years later.</sentence><sentence id="551">I married when I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span>, which was my wife's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I've been a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Carlton University</span> in the School of International Affairs ever since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="556">Q: What effect has all of this had on you do you think?</sentence><sentence id="557">The experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, certainly the correspondence afterwards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I think the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one.</sentence><sentence id="561">I, all my career both in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and teaching has been on how do systems work.</sentence><sentence id="562">What are ideologies of political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and the fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there was based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of, of, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it is and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so efficiently run.</sentence><sentence id="563">This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a Jewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I didn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> would feel.</sentence><sentence id="564">I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="565">So that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> had this first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me.</sentence><sentence id="566">It just physically upset me, but afterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems based on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this, this is what stays with me that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> proved that you can do it.</sentence><sentence id="567">Do it well, from that point of view.</sentence><sentence id="568">As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I 0 do tell students in my first class in the sessions when I teach development, the word development has been my life.</sentence><sentence id="569">And I say you know I, I do remember one thing.</sentence><sentence id="570">When I was a kid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take young people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie, and get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you can bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy.</sentence><sentence id="571">It's not hard.</sentence><sentence id="572">It's not hard to teach people to enjoy cutting down a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="573">But how difficult it is to get people to join voluntarily to build and to develop it, to plant <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">That thought has stayed in my mind all my life.</sentence><sentence id="575">Just that the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young people and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they want to be different.</sentence><sentence id="576">This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy to do to do that, so <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> just made me think very deeply about this paradox of civilization.</sentence><sentence id="577">How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next.</sentence><sentence id="578">I may just on a somewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the camera that took the pictures that that I've been talking about.</sentence><sentence id="579">in my childhood in <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>, it was quite common for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot crows because they would eat wheat, and we'd shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd eat wheat.</sentence><sentence id="580">So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it.</sentence><sentence id="581">But when I was commissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the <span class="DLF">channel</span>, gave officers side arms.</sentence><sentence id="582">We were gentlemen.</sentence><sentence id="583">We had side arms.</sentence><sentence id="584">And enlisted men, men had these big rifles, 303's.</sentence><sentence id="585">On our way to as close as we could get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> before coming to this incident with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, we spent a night at one of the many <span class="BUILDING">German guest houses</span> on the edge of the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">And there were these little round <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where people would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind.</sentence><sentence id="587">So I asked my Flight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a powerful rifle.</sentence><sentence id="588">Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told there were.</sentence><sentence id="589">It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, being fed and protected by the civilians.</sentence><sentence id="590">If there are Germans there and if for some reason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little popgun, wouldn't be worth anything at ten yards.</sentence><sentence id="591">So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which is a big rifle.</sentence><sentence id="592">I think it was a Lee Enfield (ph).</sentence><sentence id="593">So he said OK, and after dinner we went out.</sentence><sentence id="594">It was six o'clock or seven o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="595">It was good light, and I took this big rifle.</sentence><sentence id="596">They, they have a recoil so you push them up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little <span class="DLF">window</span> and he said you see that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it.</sentence><sentence id="597">So I aimed and pressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, and I turned to him you know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="598">And out from behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> come two German officers, who had been hiding.</sentence><sentence id="599">They didn't know we were there.</sentence><sentence id="600">We didn't know they were there.</sentence><sentence id="601">But they thought that we'd seen them and were shooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and hands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here, this is a bribe, and the other takes a little icon camera off his neck and hands it to me.</sentence><sentence id="602">Then we didn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman came and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera.</sentence><sentence id="603">And I got film and I think it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your 1 <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous in the, after the event, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the pictures that I did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Is there anything you want to add, anything that comes back to you ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
