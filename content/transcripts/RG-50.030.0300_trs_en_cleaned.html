<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Why don't you tell me your full name and your name when you were born, and when and where you were born and then a little about your childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Lisa Nussbaum Derman.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in Raczki Poland in 1926.</sentence><sentence id="5">I was one of three children.</sentence><sentence id="6">I had an older sister Pola and a baby brother Busiek.</sentence><sentence id="7">My parents Herschel and Gittel Nussbaum and an Aunt Sarah that lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="8">I lived in a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">We were approximately five kilometers from the <span class="DLF">German border</span> in <span class="REGION">East Russia</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostpreussen</span>!.</sentence><sentence id="10">And this is where I grew up until the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="11">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with not that many Jewish families, 50 Jewish families, surrounded maybe by a 1,000 or 1,500 Christians.</sentence><sentence id="12">I grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">loving home</span>, a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> that instilled in all three of us children wonderful values that really kept me through the years and through this entire traumatic experience.</sentence><sentence id="13">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> as a child, and then I also went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, and when there were not enough Jewish children for a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my parents had a private tutor in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a Hebrew tutor for myself and my little brother.</sentence><sentence id="14">My father was an exporter.</sentence><sentence id="15">He exported geese and lumber to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and he was sort of involved within the German world, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="16">When Hitler came to power, my father's business at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raczki</span> came to a stop.</sentence><sentence id="17">He was not allowed to trade any more, and conditions had changed.</sentence><sentence id="18">We lived very close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we knew really, what went on in Nazi Germany by this time.</sentence><sentence id="19">However, we were not so much yet affected by it.</sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I grew up in was antisemitic.</sentence><sentence id="21">We suffered from Antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="22">Even though, I have to really tell, that my parents were sort of a very special family in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">My mother especially was giving of herself to absolutely everybody, Christians especially.</sentence><sentence id="24">They would come to her to write letters to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because not that many people were educated and literate in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25">And by the very same token they suffered from Antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="26">When my father's business came to -- abruptly to an end, my mother too had a business.</sentence><sentence id="27">My mother had a <span class="BUILDING">fabric store</span>, a large <span class="BUILDING">fabric store</span> and there were sermons in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> given very often to say not to buy from Jews, and especially even mentioned my mother's name -- my mother's name was Gittel but in Polish they call it Gitka (ph) -- especially to mention not to buy by Gitka.</sentence><sentence id="28">Shortly after -- right after Kristallnacht there was already an influx of German Jewish refugees that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="29">None of them came to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because we were too small of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> to accommodate Jews, but however, we heard from them about all the stories.</sentence><sentence id="30">Also, I wanted to be very much aware, even though I lived in this tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there are people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> call there a shtetl of the kind people think maybe from the Fiddler on the <span class="DLF">Roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">No, it was not.</sentence><sentence id="32">It was not because we were quite really advanced in a way.</sentence><sentence id="33">We had a radio in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">We hada telephone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father in his days when he conducted business traveled very far -- traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and to other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and we really knew what went on in the world but very little, because my parents have done at the time to change what was coming?</sentence><sentence id="35">The war broke out " <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span></sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="39">in 1939 and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, and my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, of course, was directly on the <span class="DLF">German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">And immediately the Germans came and occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">I was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when the Germans came to occupy.</sentence><sentence id="42">My mother sent my little brother and myself to my aunt that was only 15 kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="43">I don't really know what was the reasoning and such, and low and behold, when they bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, my little brother and I had the measles and we were in a shelter hiding from the bombs.</sentence><sentence id="44">And not even -- we both had such high fever that we didn't even know what went on.</sentence><sentence id="45">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was occupied and simultaneously, the Russians came and the two armies sort of met.</sentence><sentence id="46">And by rectifying <span class="DLF">borders</span> my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> remained under the Nazi occupation and the rest, 21 kilometers away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Augustow</span> was already the Soviet Union.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="47">My parents had the foresight to leave with the Russians, because the Russians encouraged anyone that wanted to leave with them were able to leave.</sentence><sentence id="48">We left.</sentence><sentence id="49">We took part of our belongings, not everything but part of our belongings and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augustew</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span> 21 kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="50">On there we were already refugees.</sentence><sentence id="51">We found accommodations.</sentence><sentence id="52">I started to go to <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> so that my sister -- my sister already at the time was in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and much higher grades than I was.</sentence><sentence id="53">My sister was 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="54">And very shortly after -- 1 would not say that I myself as a child suffered much under Russian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="55">My parents provided us with everything that they could.</sentence><sentence id="56">And now we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">We made new friends, and youth has a way of adjusting very fast.</sentence><sentence id="58">However, my parents had a much harder time, because my father being a businessman had a handicap under their -- the Communist regime.</sentence><sentence id="59">And we had to move away a 100 kilometers from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">And we moved away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augustow</span> and we moved away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after 1939, but then in the division of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the Soviet Union -- the Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, ended up under the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="61">We lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="62">And my aunt that lived with us, Aunt Sarah.</sentence><sentence id="63">We lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> --on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Shchara</span>, and our neighbors were Christians.</sentence><sentence id="64">Predominantly, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> really was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">It was a magnificent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> because it had so many <span class="BUILDING">learning places</span>, so many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshivot</span>? --</sentence><sentence id="66">the famous Yeshiva of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, the rabbis of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, two <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Really, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that really did not lack of anything one would want to know or really to enjoy in a cultural way as a Jewish child.</sentence><sentence id="68">I had friends, Jewish friends and Christian friends, too.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="69">and shortly the war broke out between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and it is there that I really met up with the Nazis.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">We lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not bombed much, and we were not at all affected by the war per se from bombs.</sentence><sentence id="72">Very shortly after the war broke out on the 21st of June, very shortly after, there were announcements that Jews were not allowed to live in certain <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, in certain parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> and we had to move right away.</sentence><sentence id="73">We moved closer in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and it is there where really the first of 1,500 men were selected and taken on this <span class="BUILDING">market place</span>, and 1,200 men were sent to their deaths, very shortly, as soon as the Nazis occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">It was done by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Einsatzgruppen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">I am sure we did not by that time -- the name.</sentence><sentence id="76">We called ?</sentence><sentence id="77">Plural of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span></sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="81">them the <span class="BUILDING">chapones</span>?</sentence><sentence id="82">in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="83">Chapen* means to grab someone, because they literally came; they grabbed men, regardless.</sentence><sentence id="84">Whoever looked to them -- they're of a certain age, young sort of -- grabbed them and killed them.</sentence><sentence id="85">My family -- my father and my little brother were not affected.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="86">They were hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we really lived.</sentence><sentence id="87">But they did not come even to this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">Very shortly there was a law, we had to move again.</sentence><sentence id="89">It was still before the real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was established.</sentence><sentence id="90">We moved again and again, we had to vacate the <span class="NPIP">place</span> because that too was a spot -- it was really the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, quite prestigious, sort of to say, and we had to move again.</sentence><sentence id="91">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podgorna</span>, which was the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">And it is there where we moved that already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was, even though a little bit larger yet than what it ended up at the end.</sentence><sentence id="93">But it was already surrounded by -- loose, loosely what they call -- they prided themselves -- loosely <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="94">And it is there that I witnessed while we lived, still the whole family intact, that I witnessed a massacre.</sentence><sentence id="95">The Germans called it an Aktion&gt;, an action.</sentence><sentence id="96">What it means is really slaughter.</sentence><sentence id="97">And I will tell what happened to me on this day.</sentence><sentence id="98">My father did not work as an artisan, as men that had skills.</sentence><sentence id="99">He was a businessman so he only went on slave labor, and he wasn't, quote unquote, "one of these desirable Jews" for a while that did certain, like the shoemakers that sewed their boots or that made their uniforms and such, that for a while yet they need them.</sentence><sentence id="100">On Thursday a sort of strange army came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so loose yet and you could see the <span class="DLF">roads</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> have been seen and Germans and soldiers -- not only the ones that we knew that are Germans, that are the Einsatzgruppen and the chapones, but also auxiliary forces that served the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="101">There came armies in black uniforms with sort of sleeves and with certain insignias on their sleeves that were Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="102">There were Latvians that served Nazis -- not all, but in great number Estonians some.</sentence><sentence id="103">And the panic started in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">What are all these armies invading coming to do in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="105">And on the very same day on Thursday, some people returned from work and they received a -- it was called, the German called it a schein(r).</sentence><sentence id="106">It means really, a passport, a tiny little card, an I.D. card that had the person's name and number and the stamp from the Gebietskommissar" which would be the equivalent to the governor.</sentence><sentence id="107">And a panic started.</sentence><sentence id="108">Only very few very, quote unquote, "desirable people" received it.</sentence><sentence id="109">The rest of us didn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="110">My family didn't have it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="111">And my mother, before we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, first spoke to our Christian neighbor, that if there is trouble in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> she wants to send her girls to her.</sentence><sentence id="112">Would she take her girls if there was trouble?</sentence><sentence id="113">And the woman said, "Yes, send them to me."</sentence><sentence id="114">When Mother had first visualized that there was danger, she really wanted to save her girls.</sentence><sentence id="115">In a haste we were dressed.</sentence><sentence id="116">She took us to the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and, you know, it was loosely yet.</sentence><sentence id="117">They were not charged with any high 3 snatchers (Yiddish) 4 to catch (Yiddish) 5 action (German); term used for operations whose objective was the physical removal and destruction of Jews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">deg certificate (German); term used for Nazi issued work permits.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="119">T regional commissioner (German)</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="123">voltage electricity and any thing of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="124">Mother took us to the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">It was November 13" of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="126">I was not quite 15 years old.</sentence><sentence id="127">My sister and I took off our yellow stars.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="128">Mother lifted the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">We snuck out.</sentence><sentence id="130">There were always guard around the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">All of us already had to wear marking.</sentence><sentence id="132">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> the first marking we wore was a round yellow patch, a round patch in the front of the garment and in the back of the garment, and we took it off naturally.</sentence><sentence id="133">Mother lifted the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">She stood <span class="NPIP">inside</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">We stood on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">I turned my head back, and that was the last time I saw my mother because my mother was killed on this November 14".</sentence><sentence id="137">My sister and I -- it was already getting dark.</sentence><sentence id="138">I also want to say that other people tried to sneak out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">A lot of people tried to do it and many a times people were shot in the process.</sentence><sentence id="140">I guess you needed some luck too, sometimes not to be shot while you tried to sneak out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="141">It was already quite -- getting dusk, almost dark.</sentence><sentence id="142">We walked very confidently.</sentence><sentence id="143">I knew to keep my head up so nobody would pay attention of two girls walking with their heads down -- try to identifying them -- that maybe they're Jewish and such, because there was a lot of animosity <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">We walked.</sentence><sentence id="145">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">Nobody saw us walking in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">In fact, we made it a point not to walk into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with nobody noticing us.</sentence><sentence id="148">We came.</sentence><sentence id="149">She let us in and she kept us.</sentence><sentence id="150">She told us to go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to stay overnight.</sentence><sentence id="151">We did.</sentence><sentence id="152">Friday morning on November 14" there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and a neighbor came to tell her that they are killing all the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and the woman became frightened and would not keep us as much we begged her.</sentence><sentence id="153">We cried.</sentence><sentence id="154">We just begged her to hide us somewhere -- to tell her that she is no danger -- that no one saw us come into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">And also, a Jewish man had a much harder time surviving because only Jewish men were circumcised in Europe, Christians were not.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="156">So this was right away identification that this is a Jew -- was a male -- was circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="157">The woman would not keep us as much as we begged her.</sentence><sentence id="158">I have to tell you that it was already cold.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="159">It was winter.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was already some snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and she told us to go hide into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, which we were really on the outskirts, not far away -- not really far away.</sentence><sentence id="161">We had no alternative.</sentence><sentence id="162">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="163">What could we have done, two young girls?</sentence><sentence id="164">We went to hide in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="165">We came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we stayed for a while.</sentence><sentence id="166">And all of a sudden there were bullets flying all over -- flying over our heads, and we ran deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to hide from the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="167">And as we came in deeper to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> we came to the scene of the massacre.</sentence><sentence id="168">It is in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that on this Friday, 10,000 Jews were killed in open <span class="DLF">pits</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">Shot.</sentence><sentence id="170">Of course, we ran from the scene -- the blood, the screams.</sentence><sentence id="171">We ran in opposite direction hoping that we will survive this massacre.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="172">As we were sitting there, both of us frightened, shaking, a ranger came in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">He wanted to know what we were doing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we told him that we came to collect some wood for the winter.</sentence><sentence id="174">At first he believed us and he let us stay.</sentence><sentence id="175">He came from the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">He had with him -- he came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> from the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- he had a rifle slung on his shoulder and an axe behind his belt.</sentence><sentence id="177">We were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> staying and he walked in deeper.</sentence><sentence id="178">He heard all this shooting.</sentence><sentence id="179">He became curious.</sentence><sentence id="180">He walked in deeper and he saw the scene of the massacre.</sentence><sentence id="181">And he came with a rage to us -- that that we are Jewish -- we told him a lie. "</sentence><sentence id="182">You must be shot like</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="186">the rest of the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="187">Nothing had we done to the man.</sentence><sentence id="188">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="189">He was in no danger.</sentence><sentence id="190">The viciousness of men.</sentence><sentence id="191">But he didn't take us to the <span class="DLF">pits</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">He took us to the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">And as he took us to the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- leading us under the rifle -- and told us to meet up with the group of the Jews that were being led to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="194">The women and children were being walked, walked quietly, holding on to their children -- some carrying them.</sentence><sentence id="195">They were surrounded tightly with guards.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">By running out they would be shot immediately.</sentence><sentence id="197">Men were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with machine guns in the back, and as we walked on the little <span class="DLF">walker's path</span>, the ranger behind us, at one point my sister turned her head and she realized that he is a distance from us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="198">We ran from the scene to hide in the opposite side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> away from the shooting and the screams.</sentence><sentence id="199">And all of a sudden as we were sitting there -- both of us frightened, hoping that we will live through the day -- all of a sudden a ranger came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">He came from the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="201">He carried -- he came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> -- holding on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, a rifle slung over his shoulder and an axe behind his belt.</sentence><sentence id="202">He wanted to know what we were doing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we told him that we came to collect the wood for the winter.</sentence><sentence id="203">He believed us and he let us stay.</sentence><sentence id="204">He too, came deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and he heard all of the shooting.</sentence><sentence id="205">And he saw the scene of the massacre.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">He came with a tremendous rage -- that we are Jewish and away from the <span class="DLF">pits</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">We have to be killed like the rest of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="208">The viciousness of man!</sentence><sentence id="209">Nothing have we done to him.</sentence><sentence id="210">Why not find the kindness to save two young girls.</sentence><sentence id="211">He was in no danger of anything.</sentence><sentence id="212">But he did not take us to the <span class="DLF">pits</span> where they where they were killing the people.</sentence><sentence id="213">He took us to the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">He led us under the rifle to the <span class="DLF">road</span> where the group of women and the children in a great number were being led to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="215">They were surrounded by guards tightly.</sentence><sentence id="216">Women holding on to their children, some carrying them, walking very quietly.</sentence><sentence id="217">And the men on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> moving very slowly.</sentence><sentence id="218">In the back a machine gun attached to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">They couldn't run, they couldn't do anything to change.</sentence><sentence id="220">Nothing at all could they have done.</sentence><sentence id="221">We walked on a little <span class="DLF">walker's path</span> that was bumpy, a lot of ice, thin ice.</sentence><sentence id="222">As we are

there.</sentence><sentence id="308">So she told the young people when they asked her, "Who are these two girls?"</sentence><sentence id="309">She said, "Oh, I hire two maids to spin and to weave for the winter to make wool."</sentence><sentence id="310">So, she kept us there, and we begged her if the farmers go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

army that he worked for in this huge, huge depository of food.</sentence><sentence id="487">They would sometimes listen to the radio to German radio, so they approximately knew where the Front was.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="488">And then they even had, he said, they even have a clandestine radio, which was to me like something like a fairy tale thing.</sentence><sentence id="489">And our friendship grew.</sentence><sentence id="490">Our friendship grew and we really became a boy and a girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="491">By this time June rolled around, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden on a Sunday, a strange army rolled around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by that time was sealed --was closed with <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">There was not loose at all -- the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and the people counted.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="494">Always guards around the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, much smaller after the first massacre.</sentence><sentence id="495">They shrank the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, made it much smaller and the congestion was much more.</sentence><sentence id="496">And a terrible panic in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">What could these people have done?</sentence><sentence id="498">Very, very little.</sentence><sentence id="499">Only to hide -- keep them there.</sentence><sentence id="500">There weren't as many Christians that would accept Jews to hide, keep them there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="501">With an exception, I say again, of the righteous.</sentence><sentence id="502">The idea was to hide and to try and see maybe we will survive by hiding.</sentence><sentence id="503">By Sunday night the panic grew and Monday morning, early in the morning, we heard shots.</sentence><sentence id="504">We lived very close to the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">We lived on the <span class="BUILDING">Operowa</span> and the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was on a Operowa and I learned later that it was the head of the Judenrat, Gershon Kwint that came in when this Einsatzgruppen group, and this army of killers came in to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to march into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="506">He asked them, "What are you doing with my people?"</sentence><sentence id="507">He was shot and this is the shots that we heard because we were close to the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="508">We were already by this time in hiding and the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was hidden.</sentence><sentence id="509">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was hidden and we separated with my sister.</sentence><sentence id="510">The place for us, all of our neighbor, the two neighboring <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to hide was in the middle -- was under the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="511">And my father walked in to see at this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he said there were children and also he said the children might start to cry, and he felt that he couldn't breathe.</sentence><sentence id="512">He said, "I don't have enough air there to breathe.</sentence><sentence id="513">I will not go there.</sentence><sentence id="514">I'll choke to death.</sentence><sentence id="515">We will not go."</sentence><sentence id="516">My sister ran across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to find out the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which was by the name of the <span class="BUILDING">Jachwidowicz house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us.</sentence><sentence id="517">Well, she was never able to return because the massacre -- because the Aktion started.</sentence><sentence id="518">My father, my little brother and I remained in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my father, the three of us, tried to hide in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">Where were we hidden?</sentence><sentence id="520">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> had an old-fashioned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> "!</sentence><sentence id="521">youth guard (Hebrew), Zionist youth

deep <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="528">To the side was a little <span class="DLF">opening</span> for three people just to squeeze in where <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> was kept in normal times.</sentence><sentence id="529">In normal times <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> was kept.</sentence><sentence id="530">Of course, we didn't have any wood in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="531">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was wallpapered and it was really shreds sort of hanging.</sentence><sentence id="532">When they used to come to take people on slave labor, my father used to hide in this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">How did he hide there?</sentence><sentence id="534">He had a piece of cardboard that he held almost, held from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that matched the rest of the wallpaper in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, torn the same way as the rest to conceal this <span class="DLF">entrance</span> into this little <span class="NPIP">place</span> next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="535">And my father said the three of us run and hide there.</sentence><sentence id="536">Monday morning when we heard the shooting already in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we ran in to hide behind this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> that was open.</sentence><sentence id="537">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="538">The killers came in to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="539">They searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">They knocked on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="541">They never came to this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="542">Raus, raus, raus!!*"</sentence><sentence id="543">And then we heard cries and we heard shooting and we realized that the people next door were discovered.</sentence><sentence id="544">We remained in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, frozen.</sentence><sentence id="545">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move.</sentence><sentence id="546">For one of us to make a turn -- all three of us had to move to be able for one of us to make a turn.</sentence><sentence id="547">My little brother was a child.</sentence><sentence id="548">It was so hard on him.</sentence><sentence id="549">It was very hard on all three of us.</sentence><sentence id="550">We stayed there the day.</sentence><sentence id="551">We survived the day.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="552">At night my father said that we cannot stay there.</sentence><sentence id="553">It's not safe.</sentence><sentence id="554">We'll be found there.</sentence><sentence id="555">We must hide somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="556">We did not hide any more in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="557">It was open because we couldn't cover it.</sentence><sentence id="558">It was all open.</sentence><sentence id="559">The part that covered this <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was broken.</sentence><sentence id="560">So we went in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">There were <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> on the side and as we went out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span>, we realized that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is burning while we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">We didn't know, hidden in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="563">We didn't smell anything.</sentence><sentence id="564">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="565">All of a sudden we went in, in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and we saw that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is burning.</sentence><sentence id="566">But we had no alternative, so we went to the last <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">There were a row of <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">The last <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> we walked in and we saw that there was a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">trapdoor</span>, and we crawled up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and we opened up the <span class="DLF">trapdoor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="569">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> that hardly you could squeeze in and we found two old Jewish men, the old Mr. Margolis(ph) and Mr. Fink(ph).</sentence><sentence id="570">And we asked them, "What, what -- where are all the rest of the people?"</sentence><sentence id="571">They said they did not hide in with the rest of the people, because they knew they couldn't breathe there.</sentence><sentence id="572">They were coughing and they didn't want to endanger the other people, so they did not hide with the rest of the family.</sentence><sentence id="573">They were hidden in this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and we came to this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">We walked up and threw the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> away so it wouldn't be a sign that some people are hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> there on top in the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> and we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="575">We stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="576">We didn't have any food at all.</sentence><sentence id="577">Daddy went at night and he brought water.</sentence><sentence id="578">He found he could not find any bread in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="579">Nothing was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="580">He brought water so we still had water, and we stayed there Monday night, Tuesday and Wednesday and we watched the fire, the ghetto burning.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="581">I do not know how it was possible that this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> did not catch on fire.</sentence><sentence id="582">I do not know but it didn't.</sentence><sentence id="583">And we survived in this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="584">And while we were lying in the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, my father said, "What even if we survive?</sentence><sentence id="585">All the Jews are killed.</sentence><sentence id="586">What are we going to do even if we survive?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="587">What am I going to do with my two children?</sentence><sentence id="588">Where are we going to go?"</sentence><sentence id="589">But we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="590">We stayed.</sentence><sentence id="591">We stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shack</span> hoping for a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="592">On Thursday afternoon we heard noise in 3 out (German)</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="596">2 the front and we -- all of a sudden we heard steps in the back and somebody calling in Yiddish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="597">"Lisa, Lisa," and, "Jews, if anybody's hiding, answer, answer."</sentence><sentence id="598">I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="599">I could not believe it, that this was possible, and I wiggle my father. "</sentence><sentence id="600">That sounds like Aron, that sounds like his voice."</sentence><sentence id="601">My little brother opened the trap and I answered, I answered.</sentence><sentence id="602">Aron came into the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">My little brother opened the trap and he leaned over and he said, "Yes, the three of us are here.</sentence><sentence id="604">We survived the fire and we're still here."</sentence><sentence id="605">So Aron said that the massacre -- they are still purging people but it is already much quieter and it looks like they will leave some people.</sentence><sentence id="606">They will let some people live, survive.</sentence><sentence id="607">So all of a sudden a ray of hope sort of came in and then Aron tells me, "Go down.</sentence><sentence id="608">Climb down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>."</sentence><sentence id="609">I jumped down.</sentence><sentence id="610">He took me--</sentence></p><p><sentence id="611">End of Tape Number One.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="615">3 Tape Number Two</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="616">Q: Why don't we start with hearing the voices calling in Yiddish.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: As we were sitting there, it was in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="618">In fact, I'm sure it was in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="619">All of a sudden we heard footsteps.</sentence><sentence id="620">Of course, we froze.</sentence><sentence id="621">We thought that it's Germans again coming to find us.</sentence><sentence id="622">All of a sudden there were voices in Yiddish -- in Jewish and I heard, "Lisa, Lisa."</sentence><sentence id="623">At first I couldn't believe it and then I also heard in Yiddish saying "Jews, Yidden, Jews!If anybody is hiding, please answer, please answer."</sentence><sentence id="624">And I nudged my little brother and I said, "Daddy," I said, "it sounds like Aron.</sentence><sentence id="625">Could it be?"</sentence><sentence id="626">And I answered and as I answered, Aron walked into the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="627">My little brother opened up the latch and, of course, can you imagine the kind of feeling that went through me?</sentence><sentence id="628">My wildest dream would I ever imagine that I am ever going to see Aron again?</sentence><sentence id="629">And here he came really to the rescue like.</sentence><sentence id="630">He looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="631">By this time we were sitting there already three or four days without food, only with water, being so cramped in that there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to turn.</sentence><sentence id="632">And it was a very hard on my little brother.</sentence><sentence id="633">He was so restless and every time he had to move all of us had to turn.</sentence><sentence id="634">I jumped down.</sentence><sentence id="635">Aron took me to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, to the empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="636">Of course, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were empty.</sentence><sentence id="637">The people were gone already by this time.</sentence><sentence id="638">He took me upstairs to an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and he looked around for a while.</sentence><sentence id="639">He looked for some clothes and he came in and he brought with him a boy's jacket and a pair of pants.</sentence><sentence id="640">Women in Europe at the time, this particular time, never wore pants, and he found a scissor and he stood there.</sentence><sentence id="641">And I was in shock, in complete shock and he said to me that he's going to dress me like a boy because women are not allowed to live.</sentence><sentence id="642">He found the scissor and he cut my hair completely.</sentence><sentence id="643">He left a little stubs on my head and I did everything that he told me to do.</sentence><sentence id="644">He put on a cap on me and as I walked down, there was a mirror and I took a look.</sentence><sentence id="645">I took off the cap and I took a look at myself.</sentence><sentence id="646">I was frightened to see what I look like without -- shaven, not shaven but practically shaven -- without hair.</sentence><sentence id="647">But I followed him and I walked out.</sentence><sentence id="648">We came to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and four Jewish men were waiting there.</sentence><sentence id="649">They were the men that Aron worked with and already he had enough time to tell me that he has kept Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt that he works for, asked him to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to find some valuables -- I don't know -- riches, riches to enrich himself on this tragedy.</sentence><sentence id="650">And he said -- Aron said, "It was my idea because I wanted to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to see if I can still find someone alive.</sentence><sentence id="651">And maybe he has had an opportunity to take you out with me."</sentence><sentence id="652">He told me that his mother and his three sisters are alive, that he left them in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> because he says he could not take four people out.</sentence><sentence id="653">And he says, "I could not even decide; who would I take out of the four?"</sentence><sentence id="654">They put in -- they were carrying, -- all the men had on them it looked like chandeliers, really nothing fancy to speak about.</sentence><sentence id="655">Maybe it was old something with some wires.</sentence><sentence id="656">They took off-- one man gave me a chandelier sort of -- I don't know, you call it a chandelier -- something that resembles a chandelier, and he put it over my shoulder and he put some wires around my neck, and we walked out.</sentence><sentence id="657">All of us walked out.</sentence><sentence id="658">We came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and the guard was at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and Aron very confidently -- all of us carried something.</sentence><sentence id="659">Some of the men carried something in pillowcases.</sentence><sentence id="660">I didn't even know what they carried there.</sentence><sentence id="661">I learned later that all of it was for Miller, and all of us walked out.</sentence><sentence id="664">4 Aron waved confidently his slip of paper that Miller gave him to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">They came in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht, regular soldiers that worked in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them.</sentence><sentence id="666">Across the way from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> directly across was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the men that the German Wehrmacht that ran this Verpflegungsamt lived there.</sentence><sentence id="667">It was Captain Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt and Bauer also a captain and one more, a German, and two regular German men.</sentence><sentence id="668">So I was absolutely numb.</sentence><sentence id="669">I didn't really know except to follow and to do what I was told to do.</sentence><sentence id="670">Aron took me into the <span class="BUILDING">German's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="671">I could not believe why he would do it, but he didn't take me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="672">He took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="673">He left me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> within a pile of old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that was lying there and I hid behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">All of a sudden a young Jewish boy came down and he searched for me.</sentence><sentence id="675">And he said to me, "Don't be frightened, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="676">I will help you.</sentence><sentence id="677">I will do everything that needs to be done for you," he said.</sentence><sentence id="678">And the first thing what he did is he brought me food.</sentence><sentence id="679">He brought me food.</sentence><sentence id="680">And when I looked at him, he was a child.</sentence><sentence id="681">He looked to me like he was not older than 12 or 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="682">And he said, "Don't worry, I'll take care of you."</sentence><sentence id="683">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="684">He did everything what he could.</sentence><sentence id="685">He said to me, "There are maids working here, but I will not let them go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="686">Everything that they need, I will run and get it so that they won't come down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to find you."</sentence><sentence id="687">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="688">But all of a sudden as I was sitting there hidden, Bauer walked in.</sentence><sentence id="689">I didn't know anything about Bauer.</sentence><sentence id="690">Can you imagine how frightened I was?Here was a German came in and he found me.</sentence><sentence id="691">I was sure he was going to shoot me right there on the spot, but behind him was Aron.</sentence><sentence id="692">And Bauer tells me, "Stand up."</sentence><sentence id="693">And I stood up.</sentence><sentence id="694">I stood up and he said, "Do you have girl's clothes?"</sentence><sentence id="695">And I said "Yes, underneath I have girl's clothes."</sentence><sentence id="696">Because I still had the clothes that I went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="697">And he said -- then the little boy ran down, the Jewish boy, and he brought me a babushka.</sentence><sentence id="698">He said, "Take off your Boise's clothes.</sentence><sentence id="699">Put on this babushka and come with me.</sentence><sentence id="700">I'll take you to the <span class="BUILDING">Verpflegungsamt</span>."</sentence><sentence id="701">And he walked -- we walked out.</sentence><sentence id="702">I learned later that Aron asked Miller -- he said, "I'm hiding -- I brought here my sister.</sentence><sentence id="703">Please do something for her to save her."</sentence><sentence id="704">And Miller pounded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> saying, "My <span class="NPIP">place</span> is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide Jews.</sentence><sentence id="705">Take her out of here immediately."</sentence><sentence id="706">So then Aron approached Bauer, evidently while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning, and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting and the killing...he was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset.</sentence><sentence id="707">And he said, "How could I believe it that my people can do something like this?"</sentence><sentence id="708">And so Aron approached Bauer.</sentence><sentence id="709">He had no alternative.</sentence><sentence id="710">He had to take me out of this <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">He approached Bauer and Bauer walked with me.</sentence><sentence id="712">Do you know the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they lived was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that I went to before the invasion?</sentence><sentence id="713">It was recess and the children were walking out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during recess and I thought to myself, "Why am I so cursed?</sentence><sentence id="714">My parents were such good people.</sentence><sentence id="715">I am equal to all of these children.</sentence><sentence id="716">Why is it done to me?</sentence><sentence id="717">What have I done?</sentence><sentence id="718">Then this befell me.</sentence><sentence id="719">What have I done?</sentence><sentence id="720">They are free and here I am being taken to the unknown, maybe to death for nothing that I have done."</sentence><sentence id="721">I always thought the Jews were good people.</sentence><sentence id="722">All the people that I knew were Jewish were good.</sentence><sentence id="723">I am sure there some maybe that were not so good, but maybe I didn't know them as a child.</sentence><sentence id="724">I walked with Bauer.</sentence><sentence id="725">He told me to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="726">I did not have my yellow stars.</sentence><sentence id="727">I walked with him.</sentence><sentence id="728">We came to the Verpflegungsamt and there already the man that worked the Verpflegungsamt waited for me to</sentence><sentence id="730">5 come and to hide me somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="731">They made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="732">The <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was; they took out two sacks or three sacks and they covered it.</sentence><sentence id="733">They found a piece of plywood, put a piece of plywood -- put a sack to cover the plywood or two sacks to cover the plywood and marked it because it was a huge <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, with hundreds and hundreds of sacks of flour, of corn, of oats, of everything.</sentence><sentence id="734">It really supplied the entire <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> -- that there rations were given out to the Germans, to the Pole, to everybody from this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">They marked it in such a way so that they would know where I was hidden.</sentence><sentence id="736">They made just enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in this little tiny <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they took out the several sacks for me to crawl in and to lie there, and they left enough space of air to come in so I could breathe and I stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="737">I stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="738">When night came everybody left, and I remained all by myself in this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, hidden.</sentence><sentence id="739">And as I said, I remained in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">All of a sudden I was being scratched by rats, lying there.</sentence><sentence id="741">And I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by them, that they will scratch me, eat me practically.</sentence><sentence id="742">And with all my might that I possessed, I pushed the sacks back and I crawled out of this <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">And all night long I was sitting on top and running away from the rats.</sentence><sentence id="744">Then when morning came and I knew that they were going to open up the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, I was afraid for them to find me.</sentence><sentence id="745">Maybe the Germans would come before the Jews would come into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="746">I crawled in again and I was able, not very well, but to cover myself again, pulling that sack to cover as I entered.</sentence><sentence id="747">It wasn't very well concealed but enough not to notice.</sentence><sentence id="748">And anyway, if the Germans didn't know that I was hidden some <span class="NPIP">place where</span> they would go and check thousands of sacks of flour to find me.</sentence><sentence id="749">The next day they already allowed for people to live.</sentence><sentence id="750">They allowed for people to live.</sentence><sentence id="751">The people that still remained hidden were told to go out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="752">They took them all to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, the people, and they started there the selection left and right, who to live and who to die.</sentence><sentence id="753">To the

id="1937">Now, the Judenrat played both ends of the picture.</sentence><sentence id="1938">They were with the resistors and they were with the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1939">Gens had a notion because in 1943 when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the <span

survive.</sentence><sentence id="1940">Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors.</sentence><sentence id="1941">So he wanted to

the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors.</sentence><sentence id="1945">And then this tremendous play with <span

that it's -- how could I describe this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2276">It was like Robin Hood.</sentence><sentence id="2277">There's people walking around with

could I describe to you the scene as we came down the <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2283">I seen a Robin Hood.</sentence><sentence id="2284">People walking around with rifles, sides of beef hanging, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span>, people coming out of the <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> milling great number of people.</sentence><sentence id="2285">I never could have believed that this is the way the underground, the resistors, worked.</sentence><sentence id="2286">I thought they lived hidden in some kind of a small little <span class="NPIP">place</span> away where nobody could ever find them or such.</sentence><sentence id="2287">This seemed to be so open.</sentence><sentence id="2288">It seemed so open and we were welcomed right away.</sentence><sentence id="2289">The leader -- we came to a Jewish unit that was called "Revenge" -- ""Nekamah" in Hebrew -- and the leader was Joseph Glazman**.</sentence><sentence id="2290">He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know who we saw, the last people that we saw in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2291">And we learned that it wasn't that simple for Jews to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, in the Jewish unit.</sentence><sentence id="2292">That the Russians would not give them any arms, enough in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, and the thought was they met up -- they told us they already met up with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separately, and they look down upon these Jews that came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2293">After all they are ghetto Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2294">Little did they know that these ghetto Jews knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too.</sentence><sentence id="2295">And very shortly, very shortly -- the spirit was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2296">It was sort of free.</sentence><sentence id="2297">You felt free even though you knew there were dangers, that there were Germans all the way around.</sentence><sentence id="2298">But you felt free and I kept on thinking, "If people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> would only know that something like this 3 Joseph Glazman, Jewish partisan and leading member of the F.P.O.</sentence><sentence

the select youth that were able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2303">I knew it but you thought both ways.</sentence><sentence id="2304">Very shortly, very shortly this Jewish unit was disbanned, was disbanned under the pretext they are training the Soviet Union, all the nationalities mixed together.</sentence><sentence id="2305">There isn't such a thing as a Jewish unit -- it must be integrated unit.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And, of course, they sent away most of the group to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2307">Actually, it wasn't so much a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> because there were hardly -- we did not have any children in this group.</sentence><sentence id="2308">But also the artisans are people that knew how to sew.</sentence><sentence id="2309">They made them because this was the Jewish elite that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, the Jewish elite.</sentence><sentence id="2310">They send them in to bake bread, for the woman to peel potatoes and to sew, to make boots for the Partisans.</sentence><sentence id="2311">I don't know -- sew their uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="2312">I really don't know and there was a tremendous anger among the group.</sentence><sentence id="2313">Tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="2314">People felt so rejected.</sentence><sentence id="2315">They felt it was so unjust to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2316">Here people came to fight and they were sent to be ina group.</sentence><sentence id="2317">They gave some of them weapons so they can defend themselves in case they are attacked and also to go out to the farmers and get food -- to get food.</sentence><sentence id="2318">After a while there was no alternative.</sentence><sentence id="2319">People got adjusted, but they felt it was a tremendous injustice.</sentence><sentence id="2320">All of us felt it was a tremendous injustice.</sentence><sentence id="2321">We remained in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> and we were the first among the Russian units, in a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian units</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2322">But our group, that were in this Jewish otriad(tm), remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and, of course, we met up with Antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="2323">With Antisemitism women had a very special strike against them.</sentence><sentence id="2324">Nobody thought, the leadership and even the soldiers, the resistors, did not think that women know how to fight, know how to do -- when you need to go on a mission or something of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="2325">And they told them, you know, to do kitchen work, to do this and all sorts of menial jobs.</sentence><sentence id="2326">And some -- then Glazman took a group of really the most outstanding young men and women and they left.</sentence><sentence id="2327">They were so really hurt that this could happen to a group that was so dedicated, that was so knowledgeable, that had all the potential to do everything that was asked of resistors to do, that they left.</sentence><sentence id="2328">They left to go to the other groups that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudniki</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, to the "Pushcha"&gt; Rudniski" it was called.</sentence><sentence id="2329">In English they call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudniki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2330">And on the way they ended up, they met up with an <span class="DLF">ambush</span> and they were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="2331">One young woman escaped and she came back and told us what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2332">How they were killed and things and exactly what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="2333">Very shortly after, we were dispersed within the groups.</sentence><sentence id="2334">I was always within the Russian unit with the Jews that were remained in the Kalininski Otriad and whatever it was asked of us to do, we did.</sentence><sentence id="2335">We did it very well.</sentence><sentence id="2336">What do the Partisans do?</sentence><sentence id="2337">They really made it impossible for the German Army to move.</sentence><sentence id="2338">We cut down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and blockaded the <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2339">We mined the <span class="DLF">entrances</span> to where the resistors lived and this was called an otriad, the units where they lived.</sentence><sentence id="2340">They cut down <span class="DLF">telephone wires</span> and they made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambushes</span> at times; dynamiting the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, dynamiting also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that went to the front.</sentence><sentence id="2341">In the very same token, we helped Jews that were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because there were Jewish, young children and also elderly people, women that escaped, wanting a family that ran out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that either burning or everybody was being killed, and quite a few children.</sentence><sentence id="2342">I mean not in large numbers, no.</sentence><sentence id="2343">And we saw -- they lived at first almost like wild -- running from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and hiding and never having enough food.</sentence><sentence id="2344">Some of them even died.</sentence><sentence id="2345">But when we came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, we made sure &gt;4 military detachment (Russian) deg5 <span class="ENV_FEATURES">virgin forest</span> (Russian)</sentence><sentence id="2347">2 that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers.</sentence><sentence id="2348">If something will happen to their safety, you will be punished and punished severely.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And you'd be surprised, they listened.</sentence><sentence id="2350">Because they knew that we had power.</sentence><sentence id="2351">There were sieges every so often.</sentence><sentence id="2352">There was one tremendous siege in the fall, a little bit later in the fall in 1943, where the Germans that were going to the front had to come through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and we lost a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2353">A lot, a lot of Partisans were killed.</sentence><sentence id="2354">A lot of them were killed.</sentence><sentence id="2355">They systematically walked through.</sentence><sentence id="2356">We were hiding on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> that was covered.</sentence><sentence id="2357">We thought was safe.</sentence><sentence id="2358">It wasn't at all.</sentence><sentence id="2359">After we came out of there we realized that we could even be seen from the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2360">But somehow we survived, but 20 -- we survived but at least between 20 and 30 percent of the Partisans we lost in the siege that were killed, that were lost.</sentence><sentence id="2361">We returned back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">The base was not touched.</sentence><sentence id="2363">They never came to the base and nobody was on the base.</sentence><sentence id="2364">Now, the leadership, the leadership took it first a group of Jewish young men and I was left to guard, to stand guard for the leadership.</sentence><sentence id="2365">And after the danger really came that they realized that they cannot travel in a group with more than two or three of them.</sentence><sentence id="2366">They ran away hiding some <span class="NPIP">place</span> with farmers.</sentence><sentence id="2367">They changed their clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2368">They were after all, they were Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2369">They were Christians so they didn't have this danger of being Jews and hiding among farmers.</sentence><sentence id="2370">They left.</sentence><sentence id="2371">They left, disbanned all of us, and told us each and everyone to go and look out for ourselves and it will be over to come back to the base.</sentence><sentence id="2372">We came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span> and we found, for a while, no one.</sentence><sentence id="2373">After a while the leadership came and they start dropping now leaders from behind the <span class="DLF">enemy lines</span> to be our leaders, and we begin to grow in numbers and everybody was armed because the arms were being dropped from behind the <span class="DLF">enemy lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2374">We made an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air drone</span> like where we cleared out part of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2375">And at night on four corners of this meadow, we would light fires for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to identify where to drop the shipment of arms.</sentence><sentence id="2376">So Jews and no Jews, everybody got armed.</sentence><sentence id="2377">The others always were armed.</sentence><sentence id="2378">It's just Jews, always the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2379">And time went on and at big battles they would organize two or three or four units to come out together.</sentence><sentence id="2380">At times we just walked and walked for days not knowing what they were doing and what was going to be done.</sentence><sentence id="2381">But somehow we always came back to the base, and later we would learn that this was sort of an exercise of a sort.</sentence><sentence id="2382">Nobody questioned.</sentence><sentence id="2383">Nobody questioned.</sentence><sentence id="2384">We did what we were told to do.</sentence><sentence id="2385">Time went on and I have to tell you that one day as I was on the base, somebody came running to me to tell me that my father came into the <span
