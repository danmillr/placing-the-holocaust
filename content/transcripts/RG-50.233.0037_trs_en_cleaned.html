<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in translation or what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Well, you could get everything you wanted.</sentence><sentence id="6">I read mostly Polish translations of French, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original.</sentence><sentence id="7">In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized.</sentence><sentence id="8">Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he was subject to the general mobilization.</sentence><sentence id="9">He reported to his regiment and was lucky that he didn't become a POW.</sentence><sentence id="10">He was able to escape capture as a POW and return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> six weeks after he left.</sentence><sentence id="11">Of course, we didn't know what had happened to him throughout this period.</sentence><sentence id="12">Subsequently, he had become a very active member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> became the contact place for couriers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">Polish ladies, as well as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, came.</sentence><sentence id="14">Mordecai Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, who perished in 1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="15">He stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">furnished room establishment</span> in our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> during a mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, having traveled on Polish papers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">He didn't look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish papers.</sentence><sentence id="17">While in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I didn't know who was in the leadership of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</sentence><sentence id="18">Even those rounded up from the ruins of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>, who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> in the early summer of 1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership.</sentence><sentence id="19">It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page, that I found out about his role.</sentence><sentence id="20">There were other people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> who came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who were involved in the first armed action in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them.</sentence><sentence id="21">My brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28" of April 1942 and executed.</sentence><sentence id="22">I was in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="23">My entire family was put under house arrest and I had to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="24">By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the neck.</sentence><sentence id="25">I was taken to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the security service and put into a large <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> that was full of Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who had been there since the early morning hours.</sentence><sentence id="26">We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> past midnight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: What went on between "39 and "42?</sentence><sentence id="50">What were you doing?</sentence><sentence id="51">Were you still working or ---?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="56">I was the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="57">Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish community, and later on the ghetto community government, administered.</sentence><sentence id="58">They had to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had designated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of 3 work -- unloading, loading, <span class="DLF">digging ditches</span>, you name it.</sentence><sentence id="59">There was hardly any kind of work that we weren't assigned to do.</sentence><sentence id="60">Being the youngest, I took the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost two or three days a week.</sentence><sentence id="61">I didn't mind, I'd rather do it than have my father, who was in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor.</sentence><sentence id="62">My oldest brother had to help my father so I took his <span class="NPIP">place</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="63">In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all able-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> on the German-Soviet border in the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> to dig anti-tank fortifications.</sentence><sentence id="64">I was the only one in the family who was caught in the <span class="DLF">net</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">It turned out that if you didn't report, you simply didn't go; they didn't come after you.</sentence><sentence id="66">But if you did report, you were trapped.</sentence><sentence id="67">Several hundred of us left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, perhaps four or five hundred men.</sentence><sentence id="68">Altogether there were thousands of young Jewish men from various parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> congregated in several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> stretched along a section of <span class="REGION">frontier land</span> that ran between two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cieszanow</span>, where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of <span class="DLF">frontier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">That was my introduction to forced labor under SS rule.</sentence><sentence id="71">We left dead inmates at the <span class="BUILDING">work site</span> every day.</sentence><sentence id="72">They were simply shot at random and buried in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and covered up with moss, so that one couldn't even find their <span class="DLF">graves</span>, for there were no markers left.</sentence><sentence id="73">This went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cieszanow</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span>, from where, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>, we were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnik</span>, in the District of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">We spent the whole night in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where the Jewish community's council was located.</sentence><sentence id="75">I will never forget the kindness of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>'s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink.</sentence><sentence id="76">In the afternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapol</span> and handed over to a German private firm to build <span class="DLF">highways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">We were not under any military supervision, but just worked as civilians.</sentence><sentence id="78">We discovered soon that if you go away and don't come back, you're not missed, Several of us decided to start on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="79">We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to get a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip.</sentence><sentence id="80">We marched 16 kilometers that morning and crossed a guarded <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that spanned the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span>, and within two hours were in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">We spent the rest of that day going from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, riding in horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> belonging to Jews engaged in either transporting people or goods.</sentence><sentence id="82">After darkness, we found ourselves as "passengers" on such <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">a cart</span>, sharing the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> with a load of grain that the owner smuggled into the city of Radom, traveling through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> all night.</sentence><sentence id="83">Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting on "contraband".</sentence><sentence id="84">Had we been stopped, it would have meant the end of us all.</sentence><sentence id="85">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span> the next morning after an absence of two and a half months.</sentence><sentence id="86">That was my introduction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> life, and in a way it helped me later on.</sentence><sentence id="87">When I arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what awaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> was uniquely evil.</sentence><sentence id="88">In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can state without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied Europe, there was no place that could match the hell of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in it's first year of existence.</sentence><sentence id="89">We walked the three kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> on 4 May 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Within one month most of them were dead.</sentence><sentence id="91">By the end of about two months, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> -- there were fifteen of us.</sentence><sentence id="92">Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for doing so.</sentence><sentence id="93">In early 1942 I came down with typhus.</sentence><sentence id="94">There were many typhus cases in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even without any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can't eat anyway in a state of very high fever.</sentence><sentence id="96">I had developed some complications and hemorrhaged all night.</sentence><sentence id="97">We lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> under strict curfew conditions and had no access to doctors or <span class="BUILDING">drugstores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">My brother risked his life to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">apothecary</span> in order to get some medication, which turned out to be the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me.</sentence><sentence id="99">The doctor who attended me was sick and he didn't know the seriousness of the problem.</sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, together with one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found one.</sentence><sentence id="101">He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the hemorrhaging.</sentence><sentence id="102">He plainly said, "There's nothing I can do, if you have some cognac, give it to him."</sentence><sentence id="103">He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I remember the stupidity of his suggestion.</sentence><sentence id="104">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1942 and he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="105">In the morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to find a donor who had my blood type.</sentence><sentence id="106">I was supposed to be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn't possibly survive the trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely low.</sentence><sentence id="107">Instead, the <span class="BUILDING">ghetto hospital</span> sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers, including my brother Moshe.</sentence><sentence id="108">I remember the technician telling the surgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine.</sentence><sentence id="109">Nevertheless the surgeon decided to use my brother's blood for there was no time to lose and he told my parents that the risk must be accepted.</sentence><sentence id="110">Transfusions were given directly from donor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins.</sentence><sentence id="111">My parents were standing over my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> knowing very well that any moment now, should my body reject the donor's blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes.</sentence><sentence id="112">The doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm.</sentence><sentence id="113">That's a good sign, he responded.</sentence><sentence id="114">He finished the transfusion and I was saved.</sentence><sentence id="115">He came back eight days later to take out the stitches and he couldn't believe his own eyes that I was alive.</sentence><sentence id="116">I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm.</sentence><sentence id="117">He suggested that I come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> after I get well to be examined thoroughly t find out how I managed to survive that ordeal.</sentence><sentence id="118">It was the same brother whose blood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">As it turned out, had I not had typhus at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and developed immunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in 1942.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Can we ask a question, Susan did ----.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="191">(S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, after you had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: When we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, i.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> yet in most of the General Government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there were formed in the spring of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="194">Except, of course, for the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in early 1940, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was incorporated into the Reich, (i.e. the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and the entire province) and the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in October or November of 1940.</sentence><sentence id="195">Yes, it was a good question.</sentence><sentence id="196">Some people escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the <span class="DLF">border</span> which consisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn't electrified.</sentence><sentence id="197">Of course, if an inmate was caught before he reached the no-man's land he would be shot.</sentence><sentence id="198">On the way to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the <span class="DLF">barbed wire fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">We saw the Soviet guards patrolling.</sentence><sentence id="200">Some officers came close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and talked to us.</sentence><sentence id="201">I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a Soviet Jewish captain.</sentence><sentence id="202">I wanted to escape, some of my friends did.</sentence><sentence id="203">They were all caught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them.</sentence><sentence id="204">Once you escaped across the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, you had to cross a stretch of no-man's land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain to reach the <span class="DLF">Soviet fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">In most instances, the German guards couldn't see, when one forced the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands of wire and going through it.</sentence><sentence id="206">The guards were too thinly spread out.</sentence><sentence id="207">However, the escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral no-man's land.</sentence><sentence id="208">Since the guards couldn't shoot at them, they fired rounds in the <span class="DLF">air</span>, thereby alerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them.</sentence><sentence id="209">Even though, the Soviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span>, running for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies.</sentence><sentence id="210">Every single one of them was interrogated in the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rava Ruska</span>, imprisoned and eventually sent to the northern gulags.</sentence><sentence id="211">Ironically, through this act of callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police apparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet- occupied Polish territories, they would have been killed a year later when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and occupied those <span class="REGION">territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">I wanted to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, no more than about 100 km south from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">I had no notion under what ghastly conditions he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> as a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="214">However, I received a postcard from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from some <span class="BUILDING">rail station</span> on the old Polish-Soviet border.</sentence><sentence id="215">In the card he told us that he is in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, forcibly evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, and going either to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> or to the <span class="REGION">Caucasus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">Well, he wound up in the far North, hundreds of kilometers north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Archangelsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">That postcard was dated July 1940.</sentence><sentence id="218">In the summer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees under their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped them to the northern gulags.</sentence><sentence id="219">That covered the vast majority of refugees.</sentence><sentence id="220">Once I found out that my brother was no longer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, I had no great desire to risk an escape attempt to face an unknown fate alone.</sentence><sentence id="221">I was too young then.</sentence><sentence id="222">Whether I would have been better off or not is hard to say.</sentence><sentence id="223">The chances are that I had as 6 good a chance to survive as to perish there.</sentence><sentence id="224">About half the people perished in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soviet camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">However, I didn't escape and returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to face the real test of fending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">The last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="227">The liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> an the annihilation of the Jewish population there began in the summer of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="228">In some <span class="REGION">areas</span>, it started earlier.</sentence><sentence id="229">So about three or four months after I was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and my brother executed, my family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family were shipped to and annihilated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> became the <span class="DLF">killing field</span> of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the districts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">In addition, of course, to devouring <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> of Jews from all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="232">My personal saga began with my arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">My experience at the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for the conversion of civilians into prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="234">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">Time was not conceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days.</sentence><sentence id="236">If one survived the day, one achieved the unlikely.</sentence><sentence id="237">If one survived a month, one achieved the impossible.</sentence><sentence id="238">When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I had been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals, by the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a day or two, became aware of the fact that they won't survive too long.</sentence><sentence id="239">Later on, it became a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">We didn't even know upon arrival that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi killing machine of European Jewry.</sentence><sentence id="241">It took us several months to find out exactly what was going on right there.</sentence><sentence id="242">QO: Did you know that they were killing people in those <span class="NPIP">places</span>?</sentence><sentence id="243">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were loaded at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz railroad camp</span> and traveled the two miles to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, passing the <span class="DLF">road</span> that surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">Birkenau camp complex</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">We sometimes saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and occasionally passed them by on the <span class="DLF">road</span> on our way to work.</sentence><sentence id="245">Most of my work, and the work of people around me, was involved in enlarging the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">It was an enormous universe of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a million prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="247">My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was digging the foundations for <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> one.</sentence><sentence id="248">By mid-summer of 1942, they had some crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from 16 to 25 years of age, and forming a <span class="BUILDING">masonry school</span> to teach us how to become bricklayers.</sentence><sentence id="249">I don't know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco.</sentence><sentence id="250">Not one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer.</sentence><sentence id="251">Many of the 800 did of typhus during the summer anyway, i.e., they were selected to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> after contracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they didn't have to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the heat of summer.</sentence><sentence id="252">With the rations that we received, compounded by the lack of water, hard labor, sleepless nights and beatings, one did not last long.</sentence><sentence id="253">We were lucky that during a crucial period in the summer, we were indoors in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> receiving instruction on how to lay bricks.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: No!</sentence><sentence id="494">To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very few.</sentence><sentence id="495">The old

work in the Sonderkomando because the size of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> work details almost tripled at that time.</sentence><sentence id="497">From its very inception in the spring

evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="502">By early fall of 1944, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> no longer functioned as a mass killing machine, the SS began the process of thinning out the ranks of the Sonderkomando.</sentence><sentence id="503">The first victims were several hundred men from the crew of <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> no.</sentence><sentence

intermingled with the general camp population and share their fate and survival chances in the ensuing months ahead.</sentence><sentence id="527">I was told after the war that about 30 or 40 of them survived the ordeal of evacuation and death marches.</sentence><sentence id="528"><span class="BUILDING">Crematorium</span> no.</sentence><sentence id="529">4 was blown up on January 18, and I

concrete floor of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> 3 gas chamber.</sentence><sentence id="531">We used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hammers</span> and pickaxes for the job.</sentence><sentence id="532">During our work, we found many pliers that were used by the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the gassed victims.</sentence><sentence id="533">The unbelievable circumstances of this assignment did not escape me at the time for I was the only one among the prisoners in that work detail who worked at digging the foundation and at the construction of the very same <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> two years before, and lived long enough to be present at, and participate in, it's demolition.</sentence><sentence id="534">I recall one incident during the uprising which in retrospect fills me with terror.</sentence><sentence id="535">While the <span class="DLF">road</span> outside the <span class="BUILDING">sauna building</span> was teeming with SS guards and officers running on foot and on any conveyance they could find including <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, in the direction of <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> | where the breakout took place, we in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> received the dreaded order, "Alle Juden eintreten",, i.e., all Jews fall-in.</sentence><sentence id="536">We assembled in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, separated from the non-Jewish members of the work crew, and watched with horror, and envy, the satisfaction on the faces of the latter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our foreboding of doom, and doom was exactly what we expected at the time.</sentence><sentence id="537">We never found out the reason for our being ordered to assemble, but were greatly relieved when we were dismissed later on.</sentence><sentence id="538">It was the last time in my incarceration that I was subject to that blood-chilling fear produced by an order for Jews to assemble separately.</sentence><sentence id="539">12 I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> this past September, my first visit since I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in January 1945, and I was overwhelmed by the desolateness

eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of prisoners, who at any time between 1942 and 1945, occupied these <span class="DLF">grounds</span>, not to mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but walked, or were trucked, on the nearby <span

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="631">and worked at a <span class="DLF">construction site</span> where cement was used, the empty bags were converted into undershirts by cutting out holes at the sides and top and worn under the garment as an added layer against the wind and cold.</sentence><sentence id="632">Again, you wore it at your peril for, if caught, the retribution was merciless.</sentence><sentence id="633">The combination of exposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless hours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water; lack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which frequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short life span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="634">Our daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf into five portions instead of the required four portions.</sentence><sentence id="635">Of the margarine and occasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted to us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder and either sold for other products, or distributed to his cronies and proteges.</sentence><sentence id="636">The soup was distributed at the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water.</sentence><sentence id="637">The fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any difference.</sentence><sentence id="638">The soup consisted of water, some thickener, a few bits of floating potatoes or beets and, very rarely, a morsel of meat, The presence of meat in the soup meant little to us, for we never saw it in our bowls.</sentence><sentence id="639">The kapo usually allowed the meat to sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before serving.</sentence><sentence id="640">The booty belonged to him and his

jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to be the first in <span class="DLF">line</span> to be served from the top of the container.</sentence><sentence id="642">Occasionally, the strategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> was rewarded with failure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, or when he decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the first.</sentence><sentence id="643">The bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually eaten at once.</sentence><sentence id="644">That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in the morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some kind of leaves.</sentence><sentence id="645">It required discipline to forego eating the entire ration of bread at night and have some for the
