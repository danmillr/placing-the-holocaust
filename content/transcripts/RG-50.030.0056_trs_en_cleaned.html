<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: My life before the war was very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="16">I remember living in a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, actually an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the Pest side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">You probably know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is divided by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and the part that I lived in we had mostly <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> as opposed to the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> which was private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">And I was...uh...besides my parents, obviously, I had...uh...nannies and governesses and we led a very, very comfortable life with lots of vacations and...uh.. parties and I went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">And... uh...in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages, arts, geography, history and math, everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> where a Rabbi taught Jewish history, Hebrew, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="20">Catholics went to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic class</span> and Protestants went to <span class="BUILDING">Protestant class</span> and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later.</sentence><sentence id="21">And until 1944, which was when I was 10 years old, I really don't recall anything particularly disrupting my life.</sentence><sentence id="22">In retrospect, now I understand that many things were going on since 1939.</sentence><sentence id="23">I was aware that my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, but I thought that was just being a soldier and he always came back.</sentence><sentence id="24">Uh...He went several times and came back and I...my mother did go help my father...run my father's business.</sentence><sentence id="25">My father was in paper...wholesale paper manufacturing business.</sentence><sentence id="26">Uh...But otherwise I, personally, was not aware of having to be afraid or being concerned until 1944.</sentence><sentence id="27">And that was a particularly special day in my life because my birthday is March 18th and I was having my 10th birthday party in my...my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with all my friends.</sentence><sentence id="28">They were really my parents" friends, children who I was brought up with, as well as some of the mothers and a lot of the nannies or governesses.</sentence><sentence id="29">And it was an early evening party of hot dogs, and...uh...we lived on a fairly main <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">We heard marching of soldiers and we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the German army at that point, to my recall, was occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was the last of the <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span> to be occupied.</sentence><sentence id="32"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had already had German troops in them.</sentence><sentence id="33">And everybody started running around and there went my party.</sentence><sentence id="34">Everybody went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And the reason being that they were all afraid and that the Germans at that time were occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and...uh...that's when our whole world really fell apart.</sentence><sentence id="36">Uh... There were a lot of negotiations.</sentence><sentence id="37">I didn't really know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="38">Everybody tried to keep the children from worrying and...uh...we lived in...uh...a designated <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was called the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span>...uh... which happened to have been the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we were in.</sentence><sentence id="39">What that meant is that several <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span>, were designated <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> where the Christians had the option to stay or go.</sentence><sentence id="40">In a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span>, the Jews stayed and the ones that were not the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span>, the Jews had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="41">Also we had a fairly large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and we were only allowed to live in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">But because my father was fairly active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, we were able to pick the families to move into all the other <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">So we had friends and family move in.</sentence><sentence id="44">Uh...My parents" <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> because our...our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">We had friends in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and somebody else in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and somebody else in my...in my old <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">Uh...That's when I first was aware of the fact that things were not quite the same.</sentence><sentence id="47">Also, one of the laws that came to pass at the time was that Jews could not have help, servants or whatever you want to call them.</sentence><sentence id="48">And...uh...so all our so-called staff, which consisted of my governess and a cook and a maid, had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="49">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: What were the sanitary facilities like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Uh... Well, it was difficult because we had <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and all that but it was a...it was really really interesting from a child's point of view.</sentence><sentence id="88">It was a time of sharing and pulling together.</sentence><sentence id="89">I was an only child, so I thought it was just terrific to have all these children running around and I was always brought up very properly, to behave myself and speak when I was spoken to, and here they were all these people running around.</sentence><sentence id="90">And one of my father's very good friends who was a lawyer and had a great deal of...a tremendous sense of humor wrote poetry for the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, to the effect that the men were to put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seats</span> down after use and all sorts of funny things.</sentence><sentence id="91">We just thought that this was great fun and we played jokes...uh...on the grownups and...uh...but things did progressively get worse because... And one of my first personal experiences as a child was when a little girl who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, who stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>...all the Gentiles chose to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in their own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, but they kept the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">And one little girl said...I asked if I could play with her in that afternoon as we usually had, and she said no, she couldn't play with me.</sentence><sentence id="93">I said, "Well, how about tomorrow?"</sentence><sentence id="94">And she said, "No, she can't play with me tomorrow either."</sentence><sentence id="95">And I said, "Well, why not?"</sentence><sentence id="96">And she said, "Because you're Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="97">And I said, "Well, I don't really understand what that means or what does that have to do with anything anyhow."</sentence><sentence id="98">And she said well, she didn't know either, but her parents said that she couldn't play with a Jewish child."</sentence><sentence id="99">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What was a typical day like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Well, by this time we weren't going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">We were only ...Jews were only allowed to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> late in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="117">They were only allowed on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ..uh...for an hour or so, when the produce and most of the stuff was gone and what was there was not terrific.</sentence><sentence id="118">Uh...my father would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> to see what he could do.</sentence><sentence id="119">Uh...My father was a prominent person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> so that the wealthy Jews still had some influence and were able to do such things, such as acquiring the...the Star for our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to remain in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and...uh...to get much more information than we would have gotten otherwise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Tell us about the Star.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: There was a Star outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that designated being a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> so anybody that would pass by that was not <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> would know that this was a Jewish Star...<span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> and...uh...the Jews had to wear yellow Stars.</sentence><sentence id="128">Had to be exactly put on each item of clothes as a certain measurement that had to be...and it had to be put on the left upper shoulder of each garment.</sentence><sentence id="129">In other words, that when you went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you should always be identified and if somebody wanted to spit on you, kick you, shoot you, take you away, that's what you were to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Did you go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Yes, I did go out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">We did go out.</sentence><sentence id="137">I have this...my...my little boyfriend who is 11, and he and I would go out and do some stuff in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">We would also buy newspapers and sell them within the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And...uh...we also, I remember...nobody in my family smoked, but people did.</sentence><sentence id="140">Europeans smoked a lot.</sentence><sentence id="141">And we would pick up cigarette butts from everybody...wherever we could find them, take out the leftover tobacco and roll them in tissue paper.</sentence><sentence id="142">I have no idea where we got the tissue paper.</sentence><sentence id="143">And sell them to the smokers, because there was a shortage of all things.</sentence><sentence id="144">And so having this and, of course, the fact that we were children everybody bought it for us and we decided that we would support our parents because we did realize that nobody was working.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I'm not sure we supported them, but it was again great fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Did you have any frightening instances on the <span class="DLF">street</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: No, I never had any frightening instances on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">No.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh...I did have...uh...a lot of fun things in the... in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as a I said because we were friends and we had all the people.</sentence><sentence id="161">We played tricks on people and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="162">But, it was getting to be frightening because you ...you had sense of doom.</sentence><sentence id="163">You had a sense that there was... there was a lot of whispering going on, and sometimes not knowing what is going on is almost as bad as sharing and being told that okay, these are the things that can happen.</sentence><sentence id="164">Uh...There were a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>...uh...obviously, going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with lots of people in it, and everybody was making up stories about where they were going.</sentence><sentence id="165"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Labor camp</span>, to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, all sorts of things, but it was...it was getting obvious even at my age that people were being picked up, but I didn't know why.</sentence><sentence id="166">And this lasted from about the middle of March until...uh...the fall in October.</sentence><sentence id="167">And in October, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> did no longer protect the people that were there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="178">Uh...my parents were able to...uh...get the Wallenberg protection papers.</sentence><sentence id="179">Raoul Wallenberg, under the Swedish king, was able to protect and save a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="180">They were designated <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span>, protectorates, where they claimed that Jews could be saved and we did go to such a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...uh...for one night and they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people.</sentence><sentence id="181">I don't know how many.</sentence><sentence id="182">But my parents decided that there were just two many Jews under one <span class="DLF">roof</span> and if the...if the Germans really wanted to get rid of a whole bunch at a time, we would be better off going somewhere else where...where it would not be so obvious that we're together.</sentence><sentence id="183">I think that night that we left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in October was the first time that I was really scared and I think that was the experience that, as a young adult, stayed with me for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="184">I was very attached to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> that I carried.</sentence><sentence id="185">We had no suitcases to take with us because we had to travel light.</sentence><sentence id="186">Uh...we were dressed, all of us, in several layers of clothes so as to have some warmth and have some change and I did take my pillow.</sentence><sentence id="187">And...uh...I also had long...long hair.</sentence><sentence id="188">I had long braids which were cut in case the sanitary facilities were non existent and I shouldn't get lice.</sentence><sentence id="189">And I remember asking my parents...uh...where're we going to sleep that night.</sentence><sentence id="190">And my parents said, "We didn't know."</sentence><sentence id="191">We were just hoping that somebody would take us in.</sentence><sentence id="192">I said, "But we have to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">We have to sleep."</sentence><sentence id="194">And that was really very upsetting and as I said that took me a long time.</sentence><sentence id="195">I always like to know where I'm going to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="196">I don't like to go.</sentence><sentence id="197">I have to know where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> is going to be.</sentence><sentence id="198">And we went to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who took us in for one night, that night, and again everybody whispered and it was really scary.</sentence><sentence id="199">People were being picked up on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">And from then on, we went to several <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Did you actually see people being picked up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: And what were your thoughts as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: That I didn't know where they were going, and I didn't really get a lot of answers.</sentence><sentence id="229">I mean I was asking questions, but I guess my parents were...this was not the time for the truth.</sentence><sentence id="230">It was just time for me to be quiet and do what I was told.</sentence><sentence id="231">I remember very distinctly once taking issue with something that I had seen, and my mother gave me a very stern lecture and she said that if she says it's black and if I know that it is white, but if she said that it is black, it is black and I am never, ever to question because that's how people get killed.</sentence><sentence id="232">And this was not a time that people came up and said, "Are you Jewish," and my parents obviously were going to say no, and if I would have answered, "Oh, yes, we are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="233">Why are you telling a lie?"</sentence><sentence id="234">That could get you into a lot of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="235">So I was really at a very young age told...was told to just do what I'm told and not to ask questions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: Were you still wearing your star?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="247">No.</sentence><sentence id="248">At this time we were so serious.</sentence><sentence id="249">This was not admitting to being a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="250">This was hiding...uh...and my mother did not look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="251">My father did.</sentence><sentence id="252">And, of course, it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't, especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking.</sentence><sentence id="253">And...uh...she was very competent and very strong willed and...uh...was able to handle these situations.</sentence><sentence id="254">We did go to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we stayed for two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="255">Uh...A man worked for my father and my father gave him the position as superintendent of one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span>, that my father owned, and he let us stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>...uh...for a couple of days, and brought us food whenever he could.</sentence><sentence id="256">And a very nice family who I think was aware that something that was going on, told the superintendent...uh...that they were going to be away for quite awhile and sort of insinuating that without their knowledge but it's okay, if we stayed in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">Uh...I don't think we ever met them, but that's what the superintendent told us, that it's okay for us to be taken to this <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">He would bring us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tray</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">There was a radio.</sentence><sentence id="260">Uh...We listened to...uh...Radio Free Europe, and this lady happened to have had the best collection of child...of children's books, and I remember reading Little Lord Fauntleroy and a lot of the children's classics.</sentence><sentence id="261">I remember that very well.</sentence><sentence id="262">I was a avid reader, and that was the only place during the war that there were books that I read.</sentence><sentence id="263">I used to remember taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">I was too hot and I almost passed out.</sentence><sentence id="265">And one of the things that happened that I recall very clearly...and it's interesting because my mother just finished her interview and she didn't mention it...my father was having a kidney stone attack or had...we thought he had a kidney stone, and he was having an attack.</sentence><sentence id="266">And he had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="267">He had to go to a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="268">So he went and he left...uh...quite late in the afternoon so as...so as to be dark and my mother and I sat there wondering if he would ever return, if he was going to be caught or what.</sentence><sentence id="269">But he had to go because he had I guess ...I'm not sure but he must have had a kidney problem before because the choice was not to stay.</sentence><sentence id="270">It was not going to go away.</sentence><sentence id="271">Anyhow, he returned.</sentence><sentence id="272">I don't know what happened to the kidney or the stone, but he came back.</sentence><sentence id="273">And from then on, we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And by this time, there was a lot of bombing going on because the Russians and Americans were bombing.</sentence><sentence id="275">The Germans were starting to lose the war, so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any, they shot them.</sentence><sentence id="276">But I mean, it was not as active involvement in killing the Jews as to save their necks because they were losing the war.</sentence><sentence id="277">I remember somebody being shot.</sentence><sentence id="278">I think it was a Russian or a German.</sentence><sentence id="279">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="280">But I know there was a dead body, and somebody went out and stole their shoes or whatever they could off the body.</sentence><sentence id="281">But I don't really remember the details.</sentence><sentence id="282">I just know that this was a body and people went and stole things off the body because peple were now at this point didn't have shoes, didn't have clothes.</sentence><sentence id="283">The food situation was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="284">And I was an obnoxious, terrible eater.</sentence><sentence id="285">I still am.</sentence><sentence id="286">I don't eat if I don't like it.</sentence><sentence id="287">And most of the children just ate whatever there was to eat, including horsemeat off dead horses, but I was not having anything to do with that.</sentence><sentence id="288">So I had a hard time being fed because sometimes when something was found that was edible I save it up for a week and chop up little pieces of it and I would just eat it because I wouldn't eat if I didn't like it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: What was your contact with other children then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Very little.</sentence><sentence id="335">At one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, we were being hidden and there was another child there.</sentence><sentence id="336">And that's when I was told that I was not to say that we were in hiding, that we were friends of the family.</sentence><sentence id="337">And I really don't remember too much about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: What were the living conditions at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Can you describe them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: We slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>...on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>...as groups of people, together.</sentence><sentence id="349">I don't remember the sanitary conditions as far as <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">I remember my mother mending things when they were torn.</sentence><sentence id="351">Wearing the same dress, you know, over and over again.</sentence><sentence id="352">Sometimes rinsing things out in little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> if there was enough time for it to dry to wear again.</sentence><sentence id="353">And then as the bombing got worse and worse, we moved.</sentence><sentence id="354">We didn't move, we walked to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">I wouldn't call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">It was really <span class="REGION">countryside</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, peasants, a lot of poor people lived there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Before we go into that, is there any story about your mother making a cake?</sentence><sentence id="367">A Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="368">This is as a matter of fact happened in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">I was, as I said, a very bad eater and my mother, some way or other...out on a walk, saw some people that had some food and stole an egg.</sentence><sentence id="370">And out of this egg, she whipped up a I guess what you could call yellow cake thing and there was the one egg and I guess she had the other ingredients.</sentence><sentence id="371">So I ate that for a very, very long time.</sentence><sentence id="372">And then this...this was in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and there was a lot of bombing going on.</sentence><sentence id="373">It was sort of getting towards the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="374">We all slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">Usually I slept between my parents.</sentence><sentence id="376">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> there I remember, they were on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">We used to take trips to go to...to an <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> kind of a thing.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: About how many people were with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
