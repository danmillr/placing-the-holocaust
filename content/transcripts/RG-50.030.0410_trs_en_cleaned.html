<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Can you start out by just giving me the name that you were born with and the name that you live with now, please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Okay, my real, official, legal name is Regina born Laks.</sentence><sentence id="16">I also went by the name of Renia throughout my life, so actually I'm still being called Renia, but if you want to find the legal me, you will find it always under Regina, whether it's <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or professional life or however or legal or - everything is Regina.</sentence><sentence id="17">My present name is Gelb; I'm married to Victor Gelb, so I basically never use my, my maiden name, which some people did retain.</sentence><sentence id="18">I did not, so my name is really now Regina Gelb.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: And when were you born and where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: I was born December 16", 1929 ina <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, which you could not find anymore on the map now because it has been joint to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and renamed.</sentence><sentence id="26">It was basically incorporated.</sentence><sentence id="27">And if I know history of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the incorporation - the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were joined in 1931, -9, just before the war, so that first these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were adjacent basically, one was sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">factory town</span> and the other was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bedroom town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bedroom town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> really resided in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> rather than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">And I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> and, as I said before, if you want to find it on the map, you will not.</sentence><sentence id="30">You will only have to look for the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, so that's where it is and it is <span class="REGION">central Poland</span>, south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> about two hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="31">Phone interruption. ]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: I want you to do me a favor for a second.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: I want you to close your eyes for a minute and think about what comes to your - then you can open them again - what comes to mind when you first think about your childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="45">What's the picture that you get in your head about your childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Could I open my eyes now?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Well, basically a very carefree life, because I was a young child, and the second is that I was sort of privileged, more than my sisters were privileged by virtue of being the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="49">I was sort of the baby in the family.</sentence><sentence id="50">As you know, the third one in <span class="DLF">line</span> sometimes gets mistreated by the older ones, not that I was, but I certainly was spoiled by my parents because I was what you call the baby in the family, and anything around the idea of being privileged is not, does not include being spoiled; it's just being singled out for being special, it's more or less.</sentence><sentence id="51">I was forever being told I was smart and I was this and that and it actually served me very well in later years during the hard times because I always had the idea that I really could do certain things because I was always told, "Well you're was smart and you do well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="52">And you... So that later on I could rely on this idea that was lodged in my head, which, well, today, I think they have all the euphemisms- self-whatever it's called today, self-appreciation, or whatever, the fact remains that because I was a) singled out by my parents for being a very good child and smart child and for being given this, this, impetus to build on that, I think I more or less relied on it in later years, I mean, you know, during the hard times, saying, well, I probably could do it because I was told that I really could do it, so let me just do it.</sentence><sentence id="53">And that's probably the single most important aspect of my memory of what I brought out of that, of my childhood, out of my childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Do you think that was true for your two older sisters, Chris and Hania?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Well, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="63">I couldn't tell you for sure for the reason that, you know, Hania was always the, what you call the brilliant one in the family and she was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in a special <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for the gifted and whatever, and Krysia was the gorgeous, the gorgeous, the beauty of the family, you know, and I had no assets, you know, I had no such things to prove.</sentence><sentence id="64">So this is another aspect of it, you know, that Hania was always spoken of the genius of the family, which she really was absolutely, and Krysia was really strikingly beautiful, I mean, she wasn't just pretty, she was strikingly beautiful.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="65">And I'm always saying this, I'm repeating it forever because it's a fact, if Mother was walking, let's say, in the <span class="DLF">street</span> with Krysia, with Chris, and people would stop and everybody would say "Oh, what a beauty!"</sentence><sentence id="66">And Mother said, "You can't say that because she would get it into her head that she's so beautiful, she wouldn't have to make an effort in life."</sentence><sentence id="67">But the fact remains that, you know, I always felt well, if my parents say I'm smart, I must be smart or whatever, because there was nothing to be said about me.</sentence><sentence id="68">I wasn't very, exactly very pretty and I don't think I was a genius, so... And I had these teeth, you know, my teeth were uneven sort of, and I was skinny, so that I didn't present anything so outstanding as to be pegged one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="69">However, you see, whether this was an excuse that I took the fact that I was supposed to be smart, or whatever, I really built on that idea.</sentence><sentence id="70">I absorbed it and I lived with it and I built on it, so for better or worse, it really, it really did come in handy in later years.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Were you close with both of your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Very, we were an extremely close family, and not just with my parents, but with my mother's side of the family, because they lived very near, within twenty - whether it's twenty miles or twenty kilometers, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="73">Grandmother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> very near.</sentence><sentence id="74">Father's family came from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.293009" long="19.162475">Sosnowiec</span>, and that was further, much further out, was <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>; whereas <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> were in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span>, because Mother's family came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.683" long="21.75">Sandomierz</span>, which is slightly to the south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, so basically Grandma and my mother's family lived within the <span class="REGION">area</span> right, you know, how far back the family went, I don't know, but I do know Mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.683" long="21.75">Sandomierz</span>, and subsequently the family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> and my mother was married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">In fact, after the war, when I went to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> - Mother used to say that she was married on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> - and when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> to look at it, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were during Communist time in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was extremely had the dilapidated look, you know.</sentence><sentence id="76">The <span class="DLF">outside walls</span> were sort of shabby and peeling but the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> was there, it was a corner balcony and Mother said they put the huppah out there, because, you know, my grandfather was religious, so that, I imagine, to satisfy his requirements, the huppah was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, and so I found, yes, that was interesting, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is still there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: What was your father like and what did he do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: My father was, well, you know, I shouldn't be saying that, but you know they describe German Jews as Jekes.</sentence><sentence id="85">My father was basically from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> and brought up, under the, under, you know, <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was partitioned in the 18" century, so that the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was taken over by the Germans, the south was taken over by <span class="COUNTRY">Austro-Hungary</span> - <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, actually - and the rest was taken out by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">Now, my mother happened to come from the Russian quote- unquote zone.</sentence><sentence id="88">It's not a <span class="REGION">zone</span>, but you know, Russian sphere of influence; whereas my father, having been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.293009" long="19.162475">Sosnowiec</span> and grown up in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>, spoke German language, went to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> and really was this very organized, straight, very precise type of man, which they describe as a Jeke, you know, whereas, you know, this is in no way derogatory, never.. What I meant to say that he was really very much German, rather than Polish sort of thing, but of course he spoke Polish beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="89">And he was an engineer...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Let me ask you something...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: ...about his personality.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Was he a man filled with humor?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Was he very serious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: No, he was serious but, you know, there was a lot of singing.</sentence><sentence id="109">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="110">There was a lot of singing going on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="111">In fact, I understand that my - whether my mother only or both parents participated in - oh, you know, it wasn't what you call official, big <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span>, but there were the amateur groups, because I know my mother's brother, my uncle Morris - Moish - he was very much involved in amateur theatrical group and I know parents had a little contact with that, but what I do know for an absolute fact is that my father always sung in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I mean, he loved Lehar.</sentence><sentence id="112">So, when I hear "The Merry Widow", I always, but forever, associate it with my father because all certain arias from "The Merry Widow" were his absolute favorite.</sentence><sentence id="113">You could always hear him sing, and my mother, too.</sentence><sentence id="114">Whether this is different now because there are radios and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span> and all this and there isn't much talking at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or singing whatever, maybe people sing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, I don't know, but I do know that there was just singing, as you walked around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or whatever, you were singing and so my father was one of these who really kept on singing and not for any audience; for himself.</sentence><sentence id="115">Mother, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: I understand that at least Krysia and, I don't know, maybe Hania and you also sang with...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: ...with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Yes, because, you see, singing was so natural in those days.</sentence><sentence id="131">As I said, you didn't rely on any <span class="NPIP">outside</span> - I mean, a circus came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you know, or something like that - but there was never what you call, there was never a regular <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> or there was never an opera.</sentence><sentence id="132">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you see, so that basically people just organized their own entertainment and I was too young to really know, to have even gone if there was one.</sentence><sentence id="133">I would never have gone.</sentence><sentence id="134">In fact, I remember that even to go to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span>, we were, you know, the laws were so strict, a child could not go to movies unless it was a Shirley Temple movie or something.</sentence><sentence id="135">I remember going to Shirley Temple movies, but I never ever went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movies</span> otherwise because they wouldn't have let me in.</sentence><sentence id="136">That was, yes, and, this is why - as I said, there was no official <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> or, but there was entertainment provided by people who lived there and I, of course, our family being Jewish, in this particular respect, you should not associate our Jewish family with the religious part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because that was a little frowned upon, you know.</sentence><sentence id="137">We lived a more secular - not more - we did live a secular life; whereas the religious Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> lived a totally different life, as you could see it even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> these days, I mean, you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamsburg</span>, or you go to <span class="DLF">Eastern Parkway</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">Lubavitch</span> live, and you immediately see that, if you belong to a reformed <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as we do, it really is not the way we lived life, and we still could feel as Jewish as they do and I'm sure as deeply identified with "Jewishness" but not necessarily religious "Jewishness" to the extent, because we are not observant and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - my grandmother was very religious so in order for her to come and visit, Mother had to keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, but we were not necessarily kosher in any strict sense of the word.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: So even though you were a child...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: How did you understand - I know that you went to your Grandma because she was very concerned that you weren't getting a proper Jewish education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Yes, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: But was, did your father come from a more secular <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and is that why your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was so secular?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: I think so, I really couldn't tell you, I really truly couldn't tell you.</sentence><sentence id="157">All I know is that Grandmother basically, the grandmother herself did not come from a religious family, or maybe she did, because she was very well educated.</sentence><sentence id="158">And for a 19" century woman to know French and German and be fluent in languages is sort of unusual.</sentence><sentence id="159">She came from a good family.</sentence><sentence id="160">But she married my grandfather, who was very religious, and then she wore a wig.</sentence><sentence id="161">Yes, so I have one picture, which I have given to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span>, where there's a family picture with Grandma in the middle, and you could see that she is wearing a sheitel and whether she did it because... Maybe it was an arranged marriage.</sentence><sentence id="162">I mean, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="163">This is all speculation, but I do say that I have never known my grandfather, but I was very close to my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="164">And she used to invite one child at the time, in the summer, to spend a week with her.</sentence><sentence id="165">So, she did the <span class="BUILDING">Baruch Atah</span> (ph) at the breakfast and she taught us how to pray at night but, you know, she felt she needed to supplement what was missing in our education because we - I, personally - went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span>, and I also went to the <span class="BUILDING">Tarbut Hebrew school</span> after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was a Zionist organized - Mother was, you know, president of WIZO, and through her effort the Tarbut was organized.</sentence><sentence id="166">In fact, my sister Hania, Anna, reminded me that the teacher who was hired to run the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a Mr. Wopata (ph), was brought over by my mother, and he lived in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, until they found lodgings for him.</sentence><sentence id="167">So, you see, that in no way it disparages the religious group.</sentence><sentence id="168">It's just that there was a segment of population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, meaning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> because we are talking before the war - there was a segment of the population which was more, it was secular; not detached from Judaism, but detached from the strict observance, because, you know, the religious group, the Hassidim, had their own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for girls, Beth Jacob, and of course they had the heder - the heder, that goes without saying.</sentence><sentence id="169">There was a heder, and there was a girl.</sentence><sentence id="170">None of us went to any of these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, you see, so I went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span> and to the Hebrew Tarbut after, you know, after my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was out, after my <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> was out.</sentence><sentence id="171">So it didn't separate us from the Jewish population, but we were not part of that other life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Was there a good percentage of the Jewish population who were more like you than were religious, or was it a really tiny group?</sentence><sentence id="189">Do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Really, I couldn't tell you, but I do know a lot of people on my parents level who were, in fact some of them were survivors and I've kept in touch with them, and so there were, you know, they were sort of what they used to call "intelligentia", which is sort of, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="193">I use the expression for the lack of better description because I don't mean in any way to show this group to be superior to the other group.</sentence><sentence id="194">It's just that this was the less observant group, no less religious, and the fact that my mother was so extremely, extremely devoted to the cause of creating, you know, the Zionist movement, the...helping along the pioneers who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, excuse me, to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: What was she like?</sentence><sentence id="200">What kind of woman...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Very vivacious, extremely vivacious, quick moving, quick thinking and lively, lively, very lively.</sentence><sentence id="204">Father was lively, too, but in a more serious way.</sentence><sentence id="205">Mother was very vivacious and the...well, her outstanding characteristic was that she was really very...altruistic isn't the word, she was very concerned with others.</sentence><sentence id="206">She always did for others, one way or another, she did for others, you know.</sentence><sentence id="207">There was a - I remember there was a flood, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I really don't know, but I do remember that there was money being collected in the community - not Jewish community - for the cause, to help the flood victims.</sentence><sentence id="208">And I remember she made me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> out of cardboard, because we went through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for donations, and I wore that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, now, I don't know where the flood was and I don't know how that was all organized.</sentence><sentence id="209">I just remember walking around with this, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> made out of cardboard with , you know, and people would put in coins and that was the collection, so in retrospect when I think about it, and you know, all this idea of the Jewish population living parallel lives with the Polish populations but not mingling doesn't always hold true, because I'm sure this was not a Jewish flood, and I still don't know where the flood was, but I do distinctly remember as a child walking around with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, where people, it was like on a ribbon, you know, I had it attached on a ribbon, and people would put in money for the flood victims.</sentence><sentence id="210">So you see, to me, that is, this is already an indication that people who claim that there was absolutely no connection between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles doesn't hold true because, in our personal lives, I know for a fact that we were very close to Christians, to Christian families, some of whom saved our lives later on, but that's another story.</sentence><sentence id="211">But when we talk about the flood, this is a general, a more general overview of things, and much as there was anti-Semitism on another kind of level, but there had to be coexistence, that, you know, supplied some kind of a living arrangement if nothing else, so... but of course we got off the subject, I don't know how, we did...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: That's okay.</sentence><sentence id="213">Your father was a forestry engineer is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Did you know what he was doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: No, I just knew that he - the first time I heard the word "logarithm", was that he was working with logarithms.</sentence><sentence id="219">I don't know if it was a machine, but anyhow I found that it was the figuration, not a figuration, assessments of forestry, because he used to travel to eastern parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, where there were heavy forests, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">virgin forests</span> and he would assess, you know, he would assess the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> for the lumber industry and that was engineering and - I - it was engineering for which there was another Polish word, but I don't know the English word, but that was his occupation.</sentence><sentence id="220">He was, as I told you, he was educated in the German language and I imagine German in those days carried a heavy weight in the scientific field, so he, I'm sure he had an easy life, easy time of it, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Was he away a lot?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Was he away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a great deal, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: No, no, those were short trips, because, you know, he was basically employed by, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">There was a <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> owned by Jews, I think they were, I never knew, but I think they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, or somewhere but the name was Heller because everybody talked about the <span class="BUILDING">Heller sawmill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">In fact, Hania reminded me that subsequently when the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> was taken over by the Germans, there were Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who did slave labor in the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> which somehow or other I didn't exactly, you know... I only remember the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span>, in relation to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, because I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself, but I always think of war production in the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span>, but basically the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span> was also a war production, if you really want to put it in it's proper perspective, I mean, they certainly weren't building, doing lumber for Jews to build <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or anything like that, so that goes without saying.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Were you wealthy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No, but we were well to do, but not until just before the war.</sentence><sentence id="239">That was, you know, during the depression, the Heller's I think sold it, or whatever it was, they sold it or they gave it up, I don't know, but I know that Father lost the position and then we had very hard times but so did everybody else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So, how, when you say you were well to do, what, how does that manifest itself?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Well I mean, if you look at the old pictures, and you they traveled to the <span class="REGION">Baltic sea</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sopot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">My parents have a lot of pictures from, had a lot of pictures from that.</sentence><sentence id="245">I also know that Mother had severe arthritis and she used to go for cure, for six-week cure and that was another very wonderful experience because she always took at least one of us.</sentence><sentence id="246">And I still have pictures that were sent to us from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, from friends of Mother's who had those pictures from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sopot</span> and had pictures from Busko Zdroj which was that, that, no, spa and I remember going with Mother.</sentence><sentence id="247">In other words, what happened is one kid went to Grandma and two kids went with Mother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko Zdroj</span> and the six weeks that Mother had treatments there, of course, generally weakened her a lot.</sentence><sentence id="248">So, when we would come back, we would go in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know, on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, on somebody's <span class="DLF">farm</span> and we would stay a week so Mother could recover, and I imagine that you couldn't well afford, if you couldn't afford to go to <span class="BUILDING">Busko Zdroj</span> every year.</sentence><sentence id="249">In fact, you know, during the war when everything was closed off for Jews, meaning we couldn't travel, we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and such and such, of course, Mother could not go, I mean, not that we could afford it, but you know, but I'm saying that because she no longer was able to go for her treatments, which was sulfur by the way, <span class="INT_SPACE">sulfur baths</span>, and she suffered terribly, she... her arthritis was much worse because, of course, she, she had no way of curing, I mean not curing, you don't cure arthritis, but alleviating the pain.</sentence><sentence id="250">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko Zdroj</span> was a very interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a child because the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> were within a <span class="DLF">park</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="251">It was, of course, you could not, this was not a <span class="DLF">public park</span>, and they had a band shell and they had music - opera, arias - and to this day when I hear Tosca, I remember sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko Zdroj</span> in front of the band shell listening to the music, yes, it was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="252">And, and we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, which was very nearby, because you don't need to cross the <span class="DLF">road</span>, whatever, <span class="DLF">street</span>, to go into the <span class="DLF">park</span> for the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span>, and I used to go and object to the smell because, you know, sulfur smells like rotten eggs.</sentence><sentence id="253">And I would go with mother and I would hear the sound when they set up - they used to call it mud, you know, those were <span class="INT_SPACE">mud baths</span> basically, so you would - they would turn - there was always an attendant and then I sat out in a like vestibule type, or whatever it was, but I wasn't <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, but I would hear when the sound came out "bloto" - that means mud, mud was coming - and you know, and I know what they did.</sentence><sentence id="254">The person would be, Mother would be in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span>, the mud would fill it, they would put a wooden crate over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span>, and throw a sheet over it, so that she was submerged in that hot sulfur mud, after which the attendant would take her for a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and then they would massage her, whatever, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> like, then we would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - she had to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">Those were crude, very heavy-handed treatments, but they were good.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: They helped her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yes, because during the war she was really sick.</sentence><sentence id="259">She couldn't go anymore, you know, since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Busko</span> was very near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> and that required traveling, and there was no traveling for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="260">Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: I want to get, before we get to the war period, I wanted to ask you, up until 1939, what is your relationship with your sisters?</sentence><sentence id="265">You are...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: I'll tell you right away, from a viewpoint of the family type, they really liked me a lot, but I was never included.</sentence><sentence id="269">This is...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: [Laughs.]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: This is... I probably should now refer back to what I started at the beginning, that my parents, sort of, I always felt my parents took pity on me.</sentence><sentence id="275">So they said, "Oh, you're smarter than everybody," and such, true or false.</sentence><sentence id="276">I mean, I took it for the truth, but the fact remains that I wasn't to bother, to bother, to bother them, because they were already older.</sentence><sentence id="277">I was just to, to be around my parents.</sentence><sentence id="278">So, if you went somewhere, my parents took me along.</sentence><sentence id="279">If they went somewhere, you know, I tagged along.</sentence><sentence id="280">And I even have a picture somebody sent me from <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">His parents had a New Year's Eve party and you can see my parents and his parents, some other people and there's wine on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and in the middle of everything, I'm the only kid sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="282">I'm a little kid, a scrawny, little kid, meaning it really reinforces my memory that I tagged along, even though whether I enjoyed it or not, I couldn't say, but I do know that I was the special child, so to say, so they took me everywhere, but of course the truth was that they had to take me. [</sentence><sentence id="283">Laughs.]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: You know, it's interesting because Chris is only two years older than you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Right, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: But there was - you were the kid to her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="301">The reason is, I think that Chris is, first of all she is the middle child, you know.</sentence><sentence id="302">She was always very independent, Krysia was always very independent, you know, hands on, this and that.</sentence><sentence id="303">I was sort of a kid type of, that you had to look after.</sentence><sentence id="304">So Chris - maybe she felt I was a burden, if she wanted to go and have some friends, have some good times with her friends, why would she bother looking after the kid, if I fell or if I didn't fall of whatever?</sentence><sentence id="305">You know, but of course, we loved each other.</sentence><sentence id="306">As you very well know, we are the closest family that there is, that there ever was, and that wasn't even because we went through the war together, that we were bound by common horrible experience.</sentence><sentence id="307">But because the family was such, that we really were one, even though - and you know, I never felt slighted, you know.</sentence><sentence id="308">I just knew that, if I'm going to have a good time, it's going to be with my parents or with my own peers but certainly not with Chris and Miles, and that was even true during the war, not, why did I say?</sentence><sentence id="309">Miles, I didn't say Miles, I didn't mean Miles.</sentence><sentence id="310">I meant Chris and Hania.</sentence><sentence id="311">That was even true during the war when the refugees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> were sent in.</sentence><sentence id="312">You know, there was a group of Jews sent into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">And immediately the quote "golden youth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>" ended up in the circle of 0 Hania and Chris.</sentence><sentence id="314">And they would read poetry, and Byron, Lord Byron in translation and all this.</sentence><sentence id="315">I sat in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but certainly not within the circle.</sentence><sentence id="316">I heard it, I was a non- participant observer.</sentence><sentence id="317">I was somewhere in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but I was not of the group, I was with the group, you see?</sentence><sentence id="318">But that did not in any way preclude the terrific devotion that my sister had shown me, because I know for a fact there were instances during the war that I was a goner, and had it not been for them, I would never ever have survived.</sentence><sentence id="319">So, you see, when push came to shove, and of course - but even without that, you know, you study kids in the family...you know, some kids... Maybe they felt my that parents protected me, so they didn't need to bother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Let me just ask you a question.</sentence><sentence id="341">Chris - when I interviewed Chris - she mentioned something about you, that she remembered, you as a child, and I wonder if you remembered the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="342">She said you would always pick up new words constantly and use them immediately, often inappropriately, sometimes not... Do you recall that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="347">Absolutely, I mean this was really, almost an obsession.</sentence><sentence id="348">This is how I became a translator, because it's so easy for me to pick up words and think words.</sentence><sentence id="349">And when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I had no knowledge of English, but having known some French and Latin before and having fooled around with these big words - you see, Polish vocabulary contains a lot of words out of Latin, you know - so later on, I - because I really was crazy about words as a child, and of course quite often I used to misuse them, you know, misuse them, but I still used them, wrong or right or whatever; I stuck them in wherever I could.</sentence><sentence id="350">And this is why I had such an easy time with English, because it was really a matter of hearing the pronunciation and learning spelling.</sentence><sentence id="351">But if I read it to myself quietly, I could make out the text, because, you see, I have found the similarities with the other languages, and the fact that somehow or other, my mind was oriented to words, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="352">So that is true, she is absolutely right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: So, as you're growing up - now, you're born in "29, so when the Nazis take over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="362">A: I'm 10 years old, no, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: ...No, "33 - you're much younger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: So, between "33 and "39, do you hear things - I know towards the end of "39, there are German Jews that come into your <span class="REGION">area</span>, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: So, do you begin to experience... sense something, even if you don't know what's happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="376">A Well, I sensed something, but I've said it so often now, and it truly is a fact, I really didn't know very much, I don't really know, and I keep saying it, I mean, it's repetition now until you can't take it anymore, but the fact is I don't know what my parents knew and when they knew it.</sentence><sentence id="377">And I certainly knew that times were rough; I knew that something was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">But I also knew that there was a famine in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>, you know, so - because there was a famine in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> in the 30s, I think - so that I knew that there was famine in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and I knew there was something going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but how that related to my personal life or to us, it was sort of far-fetched.</sentence><sentence id="379">I did begin, during the economic times, I did begin to feel certain pressures, and I did begin to feel certain anti-Semitic, well, direct anti-Semitic references to who we were, but that was not on any scale - because as a child, you know, a child can call you a Jew and he can call you baldy and he can call you any kind rotten name, and if you can rationalize to yourself within that context, you know how kids fight, and... So, I was aware of a certain change in atmosphere in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because I do know now from studying history that there was a wave of anti-Semitism that was extremely, to the naked eye, it was easy to see, because, you know, when I translated - I was working on Korchuk (ph) a lot, Korchuk's writing, and I translated his works - I realized that his only, the only reason for his being removed from the position of the good doctor, who read poetry and talked about child upbringing on the radio in the 30s, that he was removed from that position only because of anti- Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="380">He was a very progressive educator, as you know, and a very enlightened man and he was a Jew, of course, by birth, but he was very Polish in his upbringing and outlook, not Christian, but Polish, and he brought all these new ideas to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because he studied in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, you know, and he brought the new ideas, the new approach to child upbringing, because he also wrote stories for children, you know.</sentence><sentence id="381">He wrote books about children and books for children.</sentence><sentence id="382">And he would read and they would call him the "old doctor", and I know, I used to listen to the old doctor, but then I didn't hear the old doctor.</sentence><sentence id="383">In those days, I didn't know, but I now know, that the program - that he was removed from the radio program only because he was Jew, because the anti-Semitic, the wave of anti-Semitism has progressed to the point where, toward the outbreak of the war, it was really almost palpable.</sentence><sentence id="384">And all this happened, you know, after Pilsudski died, Marshall Pilsudski, who died in 1935, had the idea of a federal, federalist state, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> being, including minorities and such.</sentence><sentence id="385">And after he died - of course all this I know now from studying history - that those who opposed him so strenuously were of the national right-wing party, and they came into prominence in the late 30s, so that the wave of anti- Semitism, which actually was given freer reign, could basically come to the fore.</sentence><sentence id="386">You know, they, maybe they weren't encouraged, but they weren't stopped.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: So, though you know this now...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="402">Q: ...from reading the history, did you experience the change as being that significant?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: I experienced - you know, I have spoken about this several times.</sentence><sentence id="407">I have experienced a few, a few such - well, it was an incident or it was rather a sort of a one-two-three kind of a happening.</sentence><sentence id="408">For example, I had - I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">I don't know if it was 1938 or deg39, first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I had a new teacher.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: But this was before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="416">A: Before the war, probably it was 19- No, I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1939 because September is when the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="417">So, it had to be 1938.</sentence><sentence id="418">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and this was a male teacher.</sentence><sentence id="419">And he said, "I would like every child to stand up, and tell me his name," you know, so that he could acquaint himself.</sentence><sentence id="420">When I stood up, and I said, "My name is Regina Laks," he looked up at me and said, "Your name is not Regina.</sentence><sentence id="421">You go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to your mother and tell her that your name is Rivka." (</sentence><sentence id="422">ph) Well, I was so hurt by it, I never forgot it.</sentence><sentence id="423">I always talk about it, always, always, because I was so very hurt by it.</sentence><sentence id="424">Apparently, I have already been feeling other things around me, but they were not as personal, in front of a class, with brand new kids.</sentence><sentence id="425">That was one incident that remained with me for a life, for the life, and another was a new family came to live in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, and I got very friendly with a girl - her name was Kaya (ph), very lovely, lovely.</sentence><sentence id="426">They were educated people, and we used to play a lot.</sentence><sentence id="427">She used to come to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>; I used to go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">And then around Passover, and I don't know what year that was.</sentence><sentence id="429">that could have been maybe 1937, because I was a little kid yet, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="430">Anyhow, so I said, "Why don't we go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and play in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="431">And she said, "No, I can't go to play in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="432">My mother said not to go because it's Passover and the Jews take blood from the children for Passover."</sentence><sentence id="433">You see, that was a child who probably wasn't anymore than 7 or 8 years old.</sentence><sentence id="434">So, those two very personal, very personal, encounters stayed with me for a lifetime.</sentence><sentence id="435">But, as I was saying, I still felt part of the environment that I grew up in.</sentence><sentence id="436">I never felt that the Christians were against me or that I was against them.</sentence><sentence id="437">I could only see the difference between the Hassidim who didn't mix at all and didn't want to mix, and the Polish population.</sentence><sentence id="438">But as far as I was concerned, I really felt very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, you know, we spoke Polish only at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">My parents knew Yiddish and spoke it to each other if they didn't want us to know.</sentence><sentence id="440">Of course, my father spoke German very well, and Mother spoke Russian by virtue of growing up in, under the Russian sphere of influence.</sentence><sentence id="441">But aside from that, Polish was the language.</sentence><sentence id="442">And, in fact, a lot of Christians were surprised that we spoke without an accent which is probably - with a subtext, with a hidden subtext, you know, when you got a compliment, "Oh, my goodness, you speak Polish so well!"</sentence><sentence id="443">Of course, there was a subtext, not that I knew it then but I know it now.</sentence><sentence id="444">In other words, I was not supposed to speak Polish so well and without an accent by virtue of being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="445">But really that didn't bother me in the sense, in any way.</sentence><sentence id="446">I took it as a compliment; I took it as a fact, you see, and I've never felt in any way angry at the Poles or blaming them or, or I never, any animosity.</sentence><sentence id="447">I mean, they were people to me, dear people, and those especially who were very dear to my parents were very dear to us.</sentence><sentence id="448">And I certainly had wonderful friends among the Christian children, so that, that issue never came up.</sentence><sentence id="449">And when those two incidents came, 3 I took them as separate and detached from the bigger picture, you know, it was on a smaller scale, kids" stuff</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: But let me - can I probe this just a little bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="488">Q: What was it, that your feelings were, when you - was it humiliation?</sentence><sentence id="489">Was it anger, when the teacher said your name is Rivka what...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: Very humiliated, I was not angry.</sentence><sentence id="493">I was... He put me to shame, because my name really was not Rivka.</sentence><sentence id="494">It so happens, if you want to, you know, give a child a Jewish name, it is Rivka - because Regina is really Rivka - but I was never, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarbut</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, I had the name Regina then was Rivka and, but I was never ever - I was either Regina or Renia, I was never Rivka and to be singled out like this, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="495">I - <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very dear to me always, and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was everything to me, and I was always good in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so I felt always elevated and wonderful about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experience.</sentence><sentence id="496">And this was a very harsh and very humiliating kind of experience because I by then knew what it was that he was trying to say.</sentence><sentence id="497">He didn't care about me.</sentence><sentence id="498">He perhaps wanted to imply that I was camouflaging my Jewishness.</sentence><sentence id="499">Because you see, I did not go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>; I went to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">And there weren't too many of us, but there were kids, most certainly.</sentence><sentence id="501">So, I sort of felt that | was being humiliated for no reason, and not because I could analyze it in depth.</sentence><sentence id="502">It's just that I knew that Rivka wasn't my name.</sentence><sentence id="503">Regina - if you looked, as I said at the beginning, if you looked at any kind of my legal papers or otherwise, records or whatever, it's always Regina, not Renia, and its not Rivka, it's really Regina - so that this was my name, I was born and given this name.</sentence><sentence id="504">So that, that was a double humiliation, as if I were really telling a lie or something on one hand, or maybe I was trying to camouflage something which was not the case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: Were there other Jewish kids in the class?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="520">A: Oh yes, certainly, yes, children, absolutely</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="522">Q: Did he do the same thing to them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="524">A: Not in this particular <span class="NPIP">instance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">I don't know, he must have, I don't know, just me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: And what did the other kids do when he said that?</sentence><sentence id="529">Did they do any- Did they laugh, did they...?</sentence><sentence id="530">Nothing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="534">A: No, and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told Mother.</sentence><sentence id="535">I said, "He told me to tell you that this is not my name."</sentence><sentence id="536">Mother says, "Don't worry about it."</sentence><sentence id="537">And what was done about it, I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: Did he ever call you that name again?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="546">A No, no, he had to call me Regina because that was in the record.</sentence><sentence id="547">But Mother did feel the humiliation I suffered and she said, "Ah, doesn't matter, it's not a big deal," whatever it was, but I never forgot it.</sentence><sentence id="548">So, it absolutely stayed with me all these years and, you know, Chris and Hania, I don't even know if they know about it, in the sense of... I had a few incidents in my life, including the German, the war.</sentence><sentence id="549">There were certain little incidents that hurt so much, that were totally insignificant on a larger scale, but somehow, you know, I guess it's how you, I don't know, I don't know what is important to you in life or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: Right, it's hard to know what it is that :</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: Yes, but those, yeah, those two things I never forgot, the one with the Rivka and with the Jews, blood for the matzos.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: So, what did you say to that little girl when she said this to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: They said nothing, "You don't even have to play with her because she's new."</sentence><sentence id="579">You know, so they said, "Well, you know she's new."</sentence><sentence id="580">You see, this is the whole point.</sentence><sentence id="581">Our parents, especially with regards to me - I cannot speak for Chris and I cannot speak for Anna, Hania, I cannot speak for them - because I was really truly protected.</sentence><sentence id="582">Anything that ever happened was somehow smoothed over.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="598">Q: Do you remember, do you remember people coming into your parents" <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, adults, before, right before the war, where there was people talking about what might be happening?</sentence><sentence id="599">Not that you participated in it, but did you ever experience people coming in and there being a certain kind of tension in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, even though you couldn't...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Well, I know my parents were very sociable.</sentence><sentence id="605">They always had company and such, but I really don't remember, no, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="606">As I said, I do, did know something going on with the German Jews and I knew there was famine in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="607">I knew that, but this, those were such big issues and I was not ever invited to share this kind of conversation, you know, so I guess between that and being protected, it really ended up by my being totally oblivious to the realities of the late 30s.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="624">A: Yeah, the Germans, yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="625">That was, I mean, it was not a shock, because they were already talking about the war, there's gonna be a war, but of course the larger part of it I really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="626">I just knew that the Germans were invading and there were <span class="DLF">anti- aircraft trenches</span> being dug and all this thing - the youth, mobilize the youth to dig the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="627">I wasn't invited.</sentence></p></dialogue>

[</sentence><sentence id="650">Laughs.]</sentence><sentence id="651">Anyhow, we had 6 to get dressed in more than one thing because, in case, when we come back and there's no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> left, we had to have something.</sentence><sentence id="652">This was the hottest September on record.</sentence><sentence id="653">So, we ended up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="680">Q: Did you take, I understand that you all carried something of value from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="681">Is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="684">A: Yes, right, not so much of value.</sentence><sentence id="685">Mother took sugar, yes, and I remember she had the salami kind of a thing she took there, because we did not know where we were going or what we'll be doing, and whatever you could wear, that's the good stuff, you wore.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A: Personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="696">Q: A toy, a doll or something?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="698">A: I really don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="699">I only remember the two things, that it was extremely hot and I had bad blisters on my feet because we ended up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, in the words, mixed in with the, not just with the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, but all the peasants who lived in the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> also evacuated and they basically took their horses and cows and dogs and so on.</sentence><sentence id="700">So you had this cacophony of sounds, the cows, and of course, 1 like to tell the story, of this, this sort of a joke on us type of incident.</sentence><sentence id="701">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, as you know, was smelting ore, because there was ore in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, and they were doing, it was doing already war production, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, where the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was, the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span>, was located in a <span class="REGION">district</span> called the central [says name in Polish] the central industrial area, that was organized for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after the first war, to arm themselves because they felt, you know, now that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was independent since 1918, they had to be armed.</sentence><sentence id="702">Well, they located these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, the plants, in this <span class="REGION">central Poland area</span> that had iron ore deposits, so there was ore smelting and such, so the rationale was such that in the first war, the first thing that was really destroyed were all the <span class="BUILDING">munition factories</span> and all this.</sentence><sentence id="703">By virtue of this historic truth, all you could expect is smithereens in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so that everybody evacuated because if not, you were going to be wiped off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> together with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="704">And we found ourselves in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, with all that as I told you, the mixture of the Hassidim and the secular Jews and the Christians and the peasants and the 7 cows and the dogs and the horses.</sentence><sentence id="705">Meanwhile, the Germans came very close by.</sentence><sentence id="706">There was no bombing, no significant bombing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, because obviously they were going to take over that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in a blink of an eye, which they did.</sentence><sentence id="707">And we got caught in a valley - "we" meaning the entire mixture of everybody - we were caught in the valley.</sentence><sentence id="708">The Germans were on the one - you know, I come from a <span class="DLF">hilly</span>, it's not mountainous area, but hilly, the Swietokrzyskie (ph) mountains are not far from us, but this is hilly area - so that you had the Germans on one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span>, you had the Polish troops on the other, and they shot at each other while we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span>, so that one horrendous night, when all the bullets were flying, we were right in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="709">And of course, the Germans in those days, and I know this for a fact, many more times from this one... [Tape cut off.]</sentence><sentence id="710">8 Tape #3</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: I think the tape stopped before you explained how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were swooping down with lights underneath them and shooting at you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Yes, at the group caught in the valley - townspeople and the peasants from the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span> - and of course that was real, true, naked warfare, that's what that was, because eventually, I hate to say that, but I do know that there was bayonet warfare going on, and that was my first real true awakening to what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="729">Q: You must have been scared to death.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="731">A: Scared to...that was a night of total fear.</sentence><sentence id="732">I mean, you know, later on, because I didn't know fear, how, how extensive and how fierce fear can be, but that one night was the first experience in my life of acute fear.</sentence><sentence id="733">I didn't know whether we would ever make it, because we were not just in the crossfire, we were also being shot at from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">But all this went on until the morning.</sentence><sentence id="735">At dawn, of course, everybody went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="741">Q: Let me ask you something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="743">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: Did your mother hold you?</sentence><sentence id="746">Were you being held on to by somebody during the night?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Yes, yes, we, I remember there were, the peasants had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span>, you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with the horse, and I remember everybody was hiding under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span>, you know, because they could see, and as I said before, the Germans, they didn't see us.</sentence><sentence id="750">They could hear because there was all that barking and baying and, and whatever other animal sounds you could hear, and even if the people were quiet.</sentence><sentence id="751">You cannot quiet an animal when he sees, when he hears shooting, so that gave us away.</sentence><sentence id="752">And the funny thing is - I just remembered something - at daylight, at daybreak, we sort of scattered from the <span class="REGION">area</span>, and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> came again, and I ran over - everybody said, "Run under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span>."</sentence><sentence id="753">So, you know there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and bushes, because we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> was sort of a <span class="DLF">clearing</span>, it was in the clearing, but surrounding was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="755">So, I ran over as fast as I could and I grabbed a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">Well, it wasn't a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>!</sentence><sentence id="757">This was a Polish soldier!</sentence><sentence id="758">Because, you know, they had olive drab uniforms, green, type of green.</sentence><sentence id="759">And, of course, in the panic, I mean, everything, so I - the thing moved, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> could move.</sentence><sentence id="760">Well, I look up and there was the soldier, but that was more as a, you know, I thought I probably felt good about it because he was going to protect me, you know, whereas everything else was naked fear.</sentence><sentence id="761">And subsequently when we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - this is also very important, I think I've already mentioned it - the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not bombed, absolutely not bombed, and that was, with I'm sure by design.</sentence><sentence id="762">So that eventually when everybody got settled back and it was now official that the Germans have occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was taken over and converted to heavy war machinery and, whereas before the war, Jews were not employed in that 9 plant, now Jews were beginning to be taken in as a labor force.</sentence><sentence id="763">Now this is just the mere beginning, because eventually, of course, the Jewish labor force was the primary force, because it was slave labor and it didn't - they had to pay the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="764">So, I really, I'm not an authority on it, but I would suspect that the professional engineers or whoever it is in that war industry, were retained and perhaps these unskilled workers, maybe the Christians, could have been dismissed, so that Jewish slave labor was hired.</sentence><sentence id="765">Because subsequently - I don't mean right now at the outbreak of the war - but subsequently, not only would the Jews start working as a force, labor force, in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, while there was still a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but once the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> set up just to supply workers to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and, since there were always typhus and there were shootings and killings and Jews were just disposed of here and there, there was forever a new shipment arriving of workers.</sentence><sentence id="766">Now, what the specific number was of workers of workers, I don't know, maybe 2,000, but I know that the number stayed as was, because they had all these <span class="INT_SPACE">assigned spaces</span>, I imagine.</sentence><sentence id="767">So that the slave labor was already in full operation shortly after the outbreak of the war, but later, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was set up, they kept the number - because you know the Jews, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was cleared of Jews, so they had no more, no more people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> to supply for the labor force, but they did bring them in from all over everywhere.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Do you happen to recall your first supper, dinner when you came back from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Yes, I absolutely do!</sentence><sentence id="790">You know, it was hot summer, and we came - in fact, when we left in the morning, we didn't clear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, because it was such a rush, and we had to get dressed, and we had to pack up, and Dad said, ""We've got to go, we've got to move because the bombs are going to fall any minute and the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is just going to be in ashes, and we've got to get out," So, we left everything.</sentence><sentence id="791">We came back, there were flies running all over, all the dishes were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and I don't really remember but, whatever there was yet, I'm sure, you know, my mother must have kept stuff in her supply cupboards or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="792">So, I don't know that we experienced starvation when we got back, because it took awhile - you know, that was basically the German, the concept of eliminating the Jews by any way you could, so it's by starvation, or by shooting or whichever.</sentence><sentence id="793">But that did not enter the picture.</sentence><sentence id="794">You came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and whatever you had in your <span class="INT_SPACE">cupboards</span> - and I imagine my mother must have stocked up on things because the talk of war was so prevalent.</sentence><sentence id="795">The only thing is that, you see, this is modern warfare - I mean, not by today's standards, when you have atomic weapons and such - in those days, that was modern warfare, but as you know even when you study sociology, they tell you, "First things happen, then culture and the way of living adapts itself to what's happening."</sentence><sentence id="796">Now, when the second war broke out, people like my parents, who survived, who went through the first war, applied the reasoning of the first war to the new experience of another war.</sentence><sentence id="797">In other words, what was true then should be applied now, and this is how you are going to manage this new event.</sentence><sentence id="798">But of course that was as far from the truth as it could be, because the warfare in the first war was not the same, the blitzkrieg itself, you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and all, that was the - I mean, the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> I don't know how many, five days something like that - so who... in the 0 first, in the first war, there was no such thing.</sentence><sentence id="799">There was, there were battles fought hand to hand, and this is why the bayonet fight, that I heard later, that was sort of unusual because it didn't fit the picture, but we did hear it at night when they said they were fighting with bayonets.</sentence><sentence id="800">It could be that was also hearsay because, yes, people would expect that, judging by the first war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="813">Q: What is your most immediate recollection of the change for your life, not everybody else's life, but as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="815">A: Yes, the first and foremost, I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="816">That was first.</sentence><sentence id="817">Number two, there is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> runs through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wierzbnik</span> its called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Kamienna</span>, it's a tributary of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>.</sentence><sentence id="818">Now, we used to go swim in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">We had a little dog and he used to go, we had a maid, she loved that dog, so she - we would go swimming and she would soap up the dog in a bucket and throw him in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and then would go after the dog in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="820">Anyhow, so number one, there was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">It was very hot, September was very hot - couldn't go swimming.</sentence><sentence id="822">Then you started seeing - the Germans were marching through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, all the time, in formation, they sung.</sentence><sentence id="823">You know, they were always marching wearing those boots and singing.</sentence><sentence id="824">And very soon, there were these - I cannot say whether it was Gestapo, SS or whoever - they started coming around in these little groupings, individuals, two Nazis or three Nazis, with a dog or two dogs, so that immediately put a stop to my even going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to play.</sentence><sentence id="825">So, all the things that were dear to me, starting with <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, number one, were now out, certainly couldn't go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> to visit Grandma because travel was out.</sentence><sentence id="826">So, I probably didn't understand the larger picture of what was involved, but I certainly knew on a more personal basis that things are completely different and that whatever is happening is not good.</sentence><sentence id="827">That much, I mean, I could see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="841">Q: Did you feel, as a Jewish person, as a Jewish child, different from what was happening to the Christian Polish kids?</sentence><sentence id="842">I mean you had, there was a very close family, the Paliszewskis, to you, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="845">A: Yes, exactly, the Christian people, yes.</sentence><sentence id="846">Well, the point is, eventually, I mean, I don't know, 10" of September, 31* of, 31deg of October or whenever, the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were open and the children went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="847">It isn't that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="848">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were closed to Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="849">So, that was the first and immediate, so to say, blow to my...to me.</sentence><sentence id="850">And whatever other bigger things that were happening, I was oblivious of that because nobody told me.</sentence><sentence id="851">As I've said so many times, my parents were so protective that I never really knew the full truth until the war was over and I started reading up on things that I found out what really went on.</sentence><sentence id="852">I just knew that nothing was good anymore, and certainly I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so that was a big blow.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: No, I was going to ask you why, because often, certainly in my family, the anger at the Polish population is sometimes more severe than to the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: Yes, this is how it was, and people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, very much so.</sentence><sentence id="937">I don't know if you know that I was involved with the restoration of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, and when I originally brought up the subject - later 1 went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1980 and we went to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> with the Paliszewski's granddaughter, she took us there - we took pictures of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> itself and of different tombstones which were, of course, overturned and overgrown and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="938">I really don't read Yiddish, so I couldn't tell whose <span class="DLF">tombstones</span> they were.</sentence><sentence id="939">Nobody from our family is buried there.</sentence><sentence id="940">Anyhow, when I came back and Victor made large size, you know he blew up the photo - we had them made into large photographs and I took them to the Starachowice reunion, at the annual .</sentence><sentence id="941">Well, I was practically attacked by some.</sentence><sentence id="942">They told me, "Renia, you should be ashamed of yourself.</sentence><sentence id="943">How you even think of having to, that we should restore something to give money to them.</sentence><sentence id="944">They never did anything for us.</sentence><sentence id="945">They would take the money, they wouldn't do it, anyhow."</sentence><sentence id="946">This is a project that started in 1980 and it was only realized ten years ago, because I finally realized there were people of good will who decided those who feel that way do not have to participate, and we did, and we did through the right channels and with the right money and everything is done.</sentence><sentence id="947">In fact, I just wrote an introduction to the book that's coming out about the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, and I was very fortunate to have it registered with one of the people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> who were dear friends of my family, Pola Frank (ph).</sentence><sentence id="948">She is no longer alive; she was my teacher in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="949">In then last minute, we registered the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with a Jewish organization - I don't know the name of it.</sentence><sentence id="950">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is right across <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emanuelle</span> on <span class="DLF">5 Avenue</span>, <span class="DLF">65th Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">I think there was a Rabbi Chaiar (ph), or Chaiat (ph) somebody.</sentence><sentence id="952">And we came in, and said we don't have the funds yet, but we'd very much like to have this on - they were submitting a list to the Polish government of Jewish cemeteries - in 3 the nick of time, he said next week or next day, whatever, they were going to submit.</sentence><sentence id="953">We got the name in.</sentence><sentence id="954">So, immediately, within a year, there was a sign posted that this is a historic landmark not to be touched.</sentence><sentence id="955">But it took us a number, a good number of years to realize that we should not wait around or take the criticism of our hometown people for, to prevent us from doing the project.</sentence><sentence id="956">And between <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and us, we had the money in no time.</sentence><sentence id="957">We send - it was done through <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>: the money was sent in, the architect was found, the caretakers were found.</sentence><sentence id="958">Apparently, that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> is now the model restored <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="959">But you see, this, I said that in reference to how other people felt.</sentence><sentence id="960">Not only did they feel terrific animosity to the Poles during all that went on, because, you know, a lot of people felt that the Poles did not do for Jews what they could have.</sentence><sentence id="961">But, you see, even after the war, for something as terribly important as a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that had all this population obliterated, there isn't a sign that there was Jewish community there except for the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, and that was my project from the beginning, Pola Frank (ph) and I were saying: Here you have the pictures, here is what it looks like, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were being built on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, first the Germans took the tombstones to pave <span class="DLF">roads</span>, then the Poles brought their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="962">Give it a few more years and you would have nothing, so that we were very lucky that, against all the criticism, we went ahead and because we worked in cooperation with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, we were really able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="963">And now I'm so pleased about that.</sentence><sentence id="964">This is really something, you know, second generation people go to visit, and other people from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and I was told that even the people who do oversee now, you know, whoever oversees the Jewish cemeteries in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, says that ours is the nicest, the best kept and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="965">The stones are upright, the lettering was done, it's cleaned up, beautiful <span class="DLF">fence</span>, <span class="DLF">iron fence</span> with a beautiful <span class="DLF">gate</span> with the magendavit (ph) on it, very nice, very nice.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1000">Q: The one question I wanted to ask before the tape is going to run out is what did, happened in your family when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was no longer possible for you.</sentence><sentence id="1001">I understand a little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was developed in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: A little <span class="BUILDING">school</span> developed, right!</sentence><sentence id="1005">And Hania, of course, was the main force behind it because she was the family genius - she had all the books.</sentence><sentence id="1006">In fact, when she was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, she used to do tutoring, anyhow, so this was like breathing air for her.</sentence><sentence id="1007">And she took three of my friends and myself and she formed a little class, and we followed the curriculum which she knew and for which the books were available in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1008">So, it was a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, with regular homework, and I resented the fact that she expected more of me than all the others, and I said, I mean, she lives with me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> - you'd think she could be a little easier on me, but no.</sentence><sentence id="1009">But, of course, later on I realized that my really truly foundation for my further education came from that, because we really studied seven days a week.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: Seven?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: Well, we did it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1021">You couldn't go swimming, the dogs were - the Germans were out with the dogs, people were being rounded up for slave labor, and kids were just either shot or kicked or the dogs was, you know, they were always threatened with dogs and the Nazis went around with the rubber whips, so even if you didn't get killed, you could be beaten up terribly, a dog could eat you up or whatever, so the only thing was to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that, that really was...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1024">Q: So, how many hours a day was Hania teaching?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: I don't remember, but big section, a big segment of the day was for <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>, and then there was homework.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And then I - he reminds me, of a friend of mine, Mitye Weigensburg (ph), they were neighbors not far from us, and people wanted to read books.</sentence><sentence id="1028">There was no access to <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, we are now talking about the secular Jews, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1029">So he and I opened a <span class="BUILDING">lending library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1030">He always reminds me about it - he lives in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> we meet once a year at the .</sentence><sentence id="1031">We took books from every <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, whoever wanted to, and we had a <span class="BUILDING">lending library</span>, so today you had my books and I had yours, and we kept records.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1038">Q: So you're ten, eleven years old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: Yes, yes, and you know, the strange thing about it is, I always say, I talk about it, nothing ever goes to waste, because, in later years when my kids were in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I was the volunteer chairman of the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 11 years, I ran the volunteers who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">school library</span> here, so, I always tell him, I say, "Guess what?</sentence><sentence id="1041">Whatever we did then applies now."</sentence><sentence id="1042">And that was true, so the schooling was done at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the homework was done at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and the rest was still around the books, we had the <span class="BUILDING">lending library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1043">People were delighted to get books because people couldn't go out, you know, and this is already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you know, because later on forget it, later on was different.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1050">A: Yes, because in the old days, you know how to recycle everything.</sentence><sentence id="1051">I mean, you never threw away a little piece of paper that wasn't filled in.</sentence><sentence id="1052">And we made little cards, so we wrote who - I can assure you it wasn't the Dewey decimal system - it was just a scribble here, a scribble there, Mrs. X got this book and Mrs. Z got the other book.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1060">Q: Renia, tell me something about what you think the effect of having a home schooling was on you?</sentence><sentence id="1061">I wondered whether you thought that in future years that it was very helpful to have all this - whatever it was you learned - in your head.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1064">A: Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1065">[Tape interruption]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1066">A: First of all, you know, as a child, you don't really plan a future and you don't look ahead to things that are included in the grown up world.</sentence><sentence id="1067">You live in your own little world, and one day's this and the next day's that, and past it, maybe two more days, and past it, there is no planning.</sentence><sentence id="1068">But absolute - my absolute thrill about being able to study was that I was back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1069">Not for future background or future foundations of how I was going to use it or not use it.</sentence><sentence id="1070">It was just the mere fact that my access to study was not severed as was my access to everything else, such as going swimming in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> or playing <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> or whichever.</sentence><sentence id="1071">So, this was absolutely the only viewpoint that I had.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Never for a minute orienting myself to how that was going to come in handy.</sentence><sentence id="1073">Aside from which, you know, as I analyze now the system, the educational system in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as against the system in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, Polish education emphasized - it was sort of an elitist concept - but it emphasized education for its own sake.</sentence><sentence id="1074">You know?</sentence><sentence id="1075">You could end up being a carpenter, but you could at the same time be the highly educated person who read all the philosophers and knew the highest level of mathematics, and never apply it to what you were doing, but had the education.</sentence><sentence id="1076">And, I don't know, by osmosis, I guess, that rubbed off - that concept rubbed off on me.</sentence><sentence id="1077">So that studying, as I said before, because this was war, and I was back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and just one day to the next being occupied by books was great.</sentence><sentence id="1078">But by the same token, I always breathed that <span class="DLF">air</span> that said, you know, you study because it's such fun; because you're going to be a mathematician or you're going to be a professor or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1079">You studied because that was really part of the great, great joy of life.</sentence><sentence id="1080">And so, assuming that I, in my child's way, incorporated those two aspects, it was study for its own sake.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Plus, it kept me out of the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the Germans were with the dogs.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And it kept me very occupied.</sentence><sentence id="1083">Plus, it also kept me in a competitive setting.</sentence><sentence id="1084">It wasn't monotonous to the extent that you were doing everything for yourself, by yourself, without measuring yourself against some other people.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And these were my very dear friends, so that the entire idea really revolved around being occupied - gainfully occupied, not just killing time or wasting time.</sentence><sentence id="1086">And whoever even thought - I certainly didn't know - planning for the future.</sentence><sentence id="1087">I could never, ever visualize, even when I was older during the war and the war was coming to an end, I couldn't even visualize the end of the war or what I would be doing.</sentence><sentence id="1088">There wasn't such thing in my mind ever of a pre- set plan, you know, of applying this to that and doing this and that.</sentence><sentence id="1089">Everything that came after really evolved out of my basic studies with Hania, there's no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="1090">It's just that I brought to it a certain attitude already, which of course lasted me for the lifetime, that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is joy and I loved it and it was good.</sentence><sentence id="1091">But I didn't know how it was 6 going to fit in the future - who knew that I would even survive, and who even knew how the world would end, how it would look, and how... No, this is totally outside the realm of my imagination.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Really, to put it totally in the perspective, that's exactly how it goes.</sentence><sentence id="1093">It didn't... The idea of a future occupation or a future plan that would evolve out of the study with Hania never entered my mind, really!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1122">Q: How many hours a day did Hania teach you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1124">A: You know, that I couldn't tell you, but I know it was a, it was a big chunk of the day, big.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Plus the fact that I did homework, and lots of it.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Lots and lots of it, so that I was really occupied all day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: Did she give you good grades?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1132">A: She did, but she always reprimanded me "cause she said I could do better than that.</sentence><sentence id="1133">So, she did reprimand me, even in front of the other kids.</sentence><sentence id="1134">I didn't appreciate that, but I loved her anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1135">But of course my parents were absolutely thrilled because there was nothing for a child to do, and being <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> was very dangerous, so that, that really filled all the needs.</sentence><sentence id="1136">My parents were satisfied, I was happy, Hania was happy, so all around, it really was good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1142">Q: So, did you not go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1144">A: Practically not.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Because, even if you did go to play, like kids play ball or something, and somebody would say, "Oh, they're out again with the dogs," you would immediately go in.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Because, you know, people were being - grown-ups were being rounded up for all kinds of things: for deportations, for killings, for cleaning, for whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1147">But children were just as big a temptation for a Nazi with a dog as a grown-up was, just for the sake of, you know, scaring a Jew kid.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1162">Q: Right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1164">A: And Chris was also in a class, in Hania's class.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1166">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1170">A: Yeah, but not in my class.</sentence><sentence id="1171">Hers wasn't a real class; hers was more... You see, this was the whole idea of keeping yourself occupied with books.</sentence><sentence id="1172">At my level, it was a class.</sentence><sentence id="1173">I don't know that Chris had homework or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1174">But it was more like maybe discussions or reading together, you know, like people could get together to read and share books.</sentence><sentence id="1175">But that was a very wonderful - this wasn't an idea that came from <span class="NPIP">outside</span>; it came from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1176">But that really kept us out of harm's way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1184">Q: It put you in a different world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1186">A: Oh, yeah, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1187">So, to sit out the war - nobody knew anything about anything that was going to happen or wouldn't happen, but you know, you have to sit out the war and however best you can, and this was a fine way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: So, the thoughts that you had are that this is war, nothing else terribly bad, it would be deprivation...</sentence></p></dialogue>

So, quietly thought, well, I think the war would be good, because from my viewpoint, why not?</sentence><sentence id="1466">I mean, all these exciting things that my parents were talking about, you see?</sentence><sentence id="1467">So, then, when the war came, and I am quite sure that we talked - the kids, among ourselves - talked about the same thing, up to a point.</sentence><sentence id="1468">Because finally, when we realized what was really going on, then I am sure that we changed around.</sentence><sentence id="1469">Because once we started fearing for our own lives, it was no more that idealized version of new things happening.</sentence><sentence id="1470">And that I remember distinctly, that I always used to say, "Gee, I really would like a war, because I would know what - you know, new things that are happening, you know, how they do it.</sentence><sentence id="1471">Because war means soldiers fighting; it doesn't apply otherwise."</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1542">A: Yes, this was the time when the screw was being tightened, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1543">There was scarce food; you had to really fight for it.</sentence><sentence id="1544">You had to keep - you could still barter; you still had access to the Polish population, you see, so you could barter and you could buy and you could try the hardest you could, but subsistence was meager, very meager.</sentence><sentence id="1545">And then - I don't know if Chris told you about it - but one Sunday, when people are leaving <span class="BUILDING">church</span> - you know, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was up on <span class="DLF">Church Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1546">Cruzcherna (ph) was up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and the <span class="DLF">market square</span>, where we were eventually, from which we were sent to the selection.</sentence><sentence id="1547">The <span class="BUILDING">market</span> square was - coming down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cruzcherna</span> (ph), from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, was the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> square.</sentence><sentence id="1548">Something happened - Poles killed a German or something - and I remember distinctly, they built a gallows in the <span class="DLF">market square</span> and they hung 12 Poles on a Sunday, when people were coming down from the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, from Cruzcherna (ph) Street, from <span class="DLF">Church Street</span>, down to the square.</sentence><sentence id="1549">In other words, I suspect that whatever exchange there was between the Jews and the Poles, surreptitious as it was and quiet as it was, could have diminished to a great extent, because that was a warning to others, too.</sentence><sentence id="1550">Of course, I found out what happened years later that they lured a German or two Germans to a prostitute and they got there and they killed them.</sentence><sentence id="1551">And so for that, 12 Poles were hung on a Sunday after <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1552">So, I imagine - I don't know what year this was, but we were still living in the so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1553">And, of course, whether this is a direct result - whether the starvation that was setting in was a direct result of this warning that they give 3 to the Christians, they gave to the Christians, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1554">But, of course, food was scarce and, and things were very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1555">The only thing was that Mother was very inventive; she once an excellent cook, so she made things out of nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1556">The first time in my life I ate cookies that was baked with sugar beets, made with sugar beets - it's because there was no sugar, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1557">So, that's, that's the screw was being tightened, but it wasn't yet completely tight.</sentence><sentence id="1558">You see, there was still the possibility of surviving, if the sickness didn't kill you, if they didn't shoot you, if the dogs didn't tear you to shreds.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1602">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1603">First, I have to say that Chris and Hania - Ana - were employed in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Because, as you well know by now, there was the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span>, <span class="BUILDING">munitions plant</span>, there was the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and there was the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span>, and I think there was one more.</sentence><sentence id="1605">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1606">All these employed slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="1607">And the word got around - first of all, able-bodied people were taken anyhow - but word got around that if you work, you have a chance to have a better life.</sentence><sentence id="1608">Not survived - we didn't talk about survival and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1609">It's just that you could live a little better if you had a job.</sentence><sentence id="1610">So, anybody who was anybody secured a job.</sentence><sentence id="1611">Now, Hania and Chris worked in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, and they had the night shift.</sentence><sentence id="1612">October 26" to 27" is when they were inside the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">October 27" in the morning - I think 6:00 in the morning - is when the round up started for the evacuation of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1614">Now, Hania and Krysia were never released from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and I really don't know about people who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">munitions plant</span>, but I imagine they were also kept back, because they were already a work force that could be counted on.</sentence><sentence id="1615">Well, I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the last of our <span class="BUILDING">residences</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, sharing the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with this Christian family, and that was past the <span class="DLF">Old Cemetery</span>, the old - old <span class="DLF">Christian cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1616">We were made to walk.</sentence><sentence id="1617">First of all, the knock came on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and "Everybody out, everybody out."</sentence><sentence id="1618">We got dressed - I know, again, several layers of clothing - and we were driven toward the market square.</sentence><sentence id="1619">So, as we passed the old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, we started coming nearer to the <span class="DLF">market square</span>, and that's where a lot of Jewish people lived before the war anyhow, but now, of course, it was packed, because other <span class="DLF">streets</span> have been cleaned - not cleaned, but cleared of the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="1620">And as people would walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, if they didn't walk straight, if their child was crying, the Germans were in a total frenzy, and there were Latvians who were assisting.</sentence><sentence id="1621">They were shooting at anybody who didn't rush, who didn't go as fast as he was told, who didn't walk straight, had one more bundle than, than it was absolutely allowed.</sentence><sentence id="1622">So that, between the old <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and the square, which was probably no more than half a mile, there was such atrocities that I rather thought the world was ending.</sentence><sentence id="1623">Because, I mean, I'd seen a lot of things up to that point, you know, but I had never seen people falling and children, infants smashed against the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, and you know, horror upon horror, and this was only a half a mile walk.</sentence><sentence id="1624">Now, my parents held me by my hand on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and as I said, I was overdressed because Mother insisted.</sentence><sentence id="1625">I also was a very skinny child, and she wanted to make me look more mature.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Of course, I wasn't developed, I was just a mere child, so she shoved some stuff into me to make me look mature and developed and she put rouge on my cheeks.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And we walked to the <span class="DLF">market square</span>, and as we were coming closer, there was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where Mother's very dear 5 friends lived, and there was a family Kalinyerska (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1628">Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was an elderly woman, maybe in her seventies - I mean, for a child, age at that time... I don't know, but I know old Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph), that's how I know her.</sentence><sentence id="1629">Her daughter went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> through the efforts my mother's Zionist ha-sharat (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1630">So, she was there.</sentence><sentence id="1631">And as we were passing very near the square, Mother - she couldn't walk - Mother took her under the arm and walked with her to the square, and I followed with my father.</sentence><sentence id="1632">And when we came to the square, the scene was indescribable, because they had the Latvians and they had the Germans and they had dogs.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And people were being whipped with rubber whips, and people were shot with rifles and with guns and with whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1634">And people were screaming and everybody - they were shouting and - whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1635">We came on a scene which was very hard to understand, because the Germans, who were standing at each corner of the square, directed the people coming out of these adjacent <span class="DLF">streets</span>: "To the right here, you go this way, you go this way."</sentence><sentence id="1636">You had no idea which way you were going.</sentence><sentence id="1637">All I knew in the final analysis was that Father was sent one way, which I understood because the men were separated, I was sent another way, and Mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were sent another way.</sentence><sentence id="1638">So, I still couldn't make out what is happening here, and who is going where and why.</sentence><sentence id="1639">Very soon, my group was whipped into formation, and I mean whipped in to formation, I think five rows and five across, and we were driven toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, meaning by Piusutskego (ph) and that way.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And we had to march in formation, as if to - as if to a beat, and whoever couldn't make it, whoever stumbled, was immediately shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1641">Now, I at this point had no - First of all, I didn't know where Hania and Krysia were.</sentence><sentence id="1642">I knew they never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1643">So, I could just imagine that they could have been sent in another group like this - whatever - or maybe they were somewhere dead and I didn't see them.</sentence><sentence id="1644">I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1645">And as I got into the group driven that way toward Starachowice plant, I found myself eventually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> - of course, I didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> was about - but this is where I ended up, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> in an open <span class="REGION">area</span>, and we were told to sit down and stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1646">I was beside myself with fear.</sentence><sentence id="1647">I was horror-stricken and totally lost.</sentence><sentence id="1648">I think of all my traumatic experiences in the world, that is absolutely the most traumatic.</sentence><sentence id="1649">Because you know, at all other times, I had somebody to lean on - Chris and Hania or my parents - this, I was totally alone, and I really didn't know, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1650">I didn't know that Chris and Hania were still around.</sentence><sentence id="1651">I was petrified.</sentence><sentence id="1652">I cried, and I was... So, people who knew the family, they said, "Oh, don't cry.</sentence><sentence id="1653">Mother will come, and this will sort itself out.</sentence><sentence id="1654">This is whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1655">They..." Whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1656">Eventually, I found out that Father was in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in other words, he was with the men and I was put with the women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1712">Q: So, you marched off with women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1714">A: With women, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, and Father marched off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> with the men.</sentence><sentence id="1715">Subsequently we found out that people like my mother and Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1716">Nobody was saying where, but of course, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1717">Hania and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krysia</span>, on the other hand, after all this was over, they were sent to place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>, which was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1718">So that somehow, because then they started - people were beginning to be shifted, because I forgot how it was - I think Majowka 6 people used to work in the <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span>, or something, or the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> - I really don't know how it was all decided who worked where - but I do know that word came back to us that Hania and Krysia survived - no, the word was not "survived" - that they were not shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="1719">That they did not - that they were not shipped out, that they are still around, and that they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1720">So, of course, now I'd met my father - not that I stayed with him, because men were separated from women.</sentence><sentence id="1721">And Father again went into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to do book work for the .</sentence><sentence id="1722">And Hania reminded me that what happened later was that Father was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>, or however it was, or Krysia was sent... How was it now?</sentence><sentence id="1723">I forget how it was, but anyhow, two of us were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, Father and I.Hania and Krysia were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1724">Later on, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were combined.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And, of course, later on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were shifted again.</sentence><sentence id="1726">But at this point, I was with my father, and that, of course, was a great consolation, even if I didn't stay with him, because he was with the men's group.</sentence><sentence id="1727">I stayed with women who knew me, who knew the family, and looked after me up to such time as Krysia and Hania joined me.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1759">Q: ...exceeds anybody's imagination.</sentence><sentence id="1760">Do you scream when you see things?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1765">Q: You're very quiet with your parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1767">A: Iam scared.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1769">Q: You're so scared... Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1771">A: Iam scared out of my wits.</sentence><sentence id="1772">I really, I couldn't scream.</sentence><sentence id="1773">In fact, when we finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, and I didn't know yet Father was around, I couldn't yet cry - but I cried later - 7 but I couldn't yet cry because I was overwhelmed with fear.</sentence><sentence id="1774">The terror of it all and the fear, it's sort of, you know, like you become breathless.</sentence><sentence id="1775">I was frozen in the fear of it all.</sentence><sentence id="1776">And I must say, this was the first time - the march to the <span class="DLF">square</span> and then the march to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> - were my real first encounter with horror which I could not avoid.</sentence><sentence id="1777">You know, like when we were coming back from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, when the war broke out, I saw dead horses on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1778">I didn't see ever dead horses before, so I covered my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1779">I sort of covered my eyes, and I didn't see the - I saw the dead horses were coming up, and there was a dead horse, so I covered my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1780">But later on, there was no way of covering your eyes, because the horror was such, and you had to watch yourself, and you had to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> and you had to march as fast as you were told to.</sentence><sentence id="1781">So that the overwhelming fear was sort of like paralysis, you know, paralysis of your brain.</sentence><sentence id="1782">You don't think.</sentence><sentence id="1783">You make the motion, your body propels you, but it's not the brain; it's the fear that propels you, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="1784">And later on, until I wound down enough to cry - it took awhile because I was out of my mind with fear because, for the first time in my entire life, I was alone, left in these circumstances, where all these years I was so protected.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1799">Q: This is going to be a strange question, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1801">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1803">Q: Do you think you were afraid because you were alone or because you were vulnerable, because you saw how vulnerable, or was the two of them...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1805">A: No, I was afraid because I was alone.</sentence><sentence id="1806">Because, first of all, because of what I saw, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1807">This was a shock to my system.</sentence><sentence id="1808">Even if I were too much (ph) with parents and my sisters, I would still be shocked out of my wits to see the horror that I encountered between leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the selection in the square and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1809">I couldn't cover my eyes and I couldn't make believe it didn't exist because I had to have my wits around me to pay attention to everything because, if somebody fell under my feet, I couldn't stumble.</sentence><sentence id="1810">So, the entire picture revolved around saving your life however you can, so you cannot disregard what's happening around you.</sentence><sentence id="1811">So, that's 1942, and this is the rude awakening that is the point at which I was facing up to what is really happening, even though I wasn't yet told anything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1819">Q: So, when you... Is the first person in your family that you saw your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1821">A: My father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1823">Q: And did you talk?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1825">A: Well, maybe not.</sentence><sentence id="1826">No, maybe waving or something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1829">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1833">A: There was not yet, you know... We were segregated; he was in one group, but the fact is that he saw me and I saw him and we waved.</sentence><sentence id="1834">And then other people got in touch with other men, so everybody said, "Oh, Renia, your father said that he's here and he'll look after..." And you know, so people would send messages that way.</sentence><sentence id="1835">So, that was the only thing.</sentence><sentence id="1836">But of course he did not know what happened to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1837">But of course maybe he knew and didn't tell me.</sentence><sentence id="1838">Because my mother was supporting an elderly woman.</sentence><sentence id="1839">So if you really had any, any understanding of the situation, you knew that Mrs. Kalinyerska (ph) was not one to be going to slave labor because she was old.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And my mother, supporting her, had to go with her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: So, one would assume if that young man who came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> - the story that Chris told - and if your parents really believed him as to what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, your father probably figured out where your mother probably went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: I can tell you, my understanding of everything is that they knew much more than they ever let on, because they were intelligent people, aside from which, you know, my father was fluent in German.</sentence><sentence id="1852">In fact, he spoke and wrote and read German.</sentence><sentence id="1853">He used to subscribe to German periodicals and such.</sentence><sentence id="1854">I doubt very much that my father didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1855">I mean, that is impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1856">But the fact that he didn't tell me, that is an absolute fact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1863">Q: So, did you keep in your head that at some point you would see your mother again?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1866">Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1867">I kept it in my head that - because, you see, the word "resettlement" was being bandied about.</sentence><sentence id="1868">What that word meant didn't quite - was never clarified, but they said "The resettlement to the east, the resettlement..." The word "resettlement".</sentence><sentence id="1869">So, you know, you can always rationalize it.</sentence><sentence id="1870">If you have already met the quota for slave labor for the <span class="BUILDING">Starachowice plant</span> and the other <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> nearby, then you resettle... I mean, on the child's level, you can more or less follow their train of thought.</sentence><sentence id="1871">The others were resettled to <span class="NPIP">places</span> which was needed other people, so that was resettlement.</sentence><sentence id="1872">And by the same token, I couldn't imagine that I wouldn't see my mother again, so that was another thing.</sentence><sentence id="1873">Hiding from the real possibility of what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1874">I felt that way right along, you know?I knew I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1875">I knew what I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I really realized, but I didn't want to know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1890">Q: So, how long did it take before you met up with your sisters, do you think, about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1892">A: I don't really know, but my next recollection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was - yeah, I worked in the laundry, you know, I was assigned to the laundry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1894">Q: That was right away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1896">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span>, right away.</sentence><sentence id="1897">So that I did not go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1898">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> maybe a month at the most.</sentence><sentence id="1899">I worked in the fa-... And my next recollection of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was that Hania became very - Hania must have already been in, because she had an 9 extreme case of typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And I remember that, because selections were being made.</sentence><sentence id="1901">We had to line up, and they told you to run, and whoever could not run fast enough was taken out and shot.</sentence><sentence id="1902">People were taken - ten or twelve men were told to dig a <span class="DLF">grave</span> - and then people were taken over to the <span class="DLF">pit</span> and shot.</sentence><sentence id="1903">So, I do remember that Hania had such an extremely severe case of typhus, she was hallucinating and talking out of her head.</sentence><sentence id="1904">I also had typhus but a mild form, so that, that was the one thing I remember so distinctly.</sentence><sentence id="1905">And I met here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, I met a friend of mine who worked with me in the laundry three years ago, and she said to me, "You know, Renia, you saved my mother's life."</sentence><sentence id="1906">And I said, "I saved your mother's life?</sentence><sentence id="1907">I never heard of anything like that."</sentence><sentence id="1908">And she says, "Well, what happened is when we worked in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span>..." She and her mother worked in the laundry with me, and her mother had a severe case of typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1909">And they called us out and told us to line up, and she says that I stood - she put the mother between me and her - her mother was a tiny little woman; we were both taller than the mother and we held on to her and they passed by and didn't notice and she survived.</sentence><sentence id="1910">Whereas I know for a fact that her mother saved my life because when I had typhus, she told me to stand over the cauldron where the steam was coming from, because I was red, you know, feverish, so she says, "When they see you, they will know that it's the steam."</sentence><sentence id="1911">And so it was - they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and looked in and then if anyone was sick with typhus, and we were all over the cauldrons there, and when I turned my head, they saw me all sweaty and red, and I was just one more slave worker doing laundry.</sentence><sentence id="1912">So, that was actually, she - that was Mrs.Shacter (ph) - And so it was news to me when she told me I saved her mother's life.</sentence><sentence id="1913">But the fact is that selections were being made right along, and typhus sufferers were eliminated one by one.</sentence><sentence id="1914">So, Hania miraculously survived that selection.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1935">Q: What did you - what went through your head when you saw these selections and people being killed because they were sick, or for some other reason?</sentence><sentence id="1936">Did you think they were going to kill everybody?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1939">A: No, absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="1940">I just don't know what I thought at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1941">I just knew that times were very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1942">And I just hoped maybe the war would be over and how it will be over, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1943">I didn't know who was fighting whom, and where was the front or if there was the front, or the Germans were there to stay, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1944">I just figured that it couldn't go on forever, you know, one way or another it has to end.</sentence><sentence id="1945">And I just - I made no connections.</sentence><sentence id="1946">In fact, I was really, truly - I was not an independent thinker in any such way that you could imagine me, planning or... I probably understood what was going on very well.</sentence><sentence id="1947">I understood it very well, because horror is not very hard to understand.</sentence><sentence id="1948">It's naked horror in front of your eyes, so you know what is happening.</sentence><sentence id="1949">But how that related to the overall thing, I knew I was petrified.</sentence><sentence id="1950">I lived in fear every second of my life.</sentence><sentence id="1951">That I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1952">After that, I couldn't say that I ever could figure out the next day or the month later or if it will end - I knew it would end sometime - but how and when, no such thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1967">Q: Now, you were probably a little past the age of when a young girl would have menstruated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1971">A: Oh, yes, not past the age, but, just to give you the quick overview, I went through all the camps - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> and back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - and I still did not start.</sentence><sentence id="1972">So, that was what you say called a delayed reaction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1975">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1977">A: And of course, I was not developed and I lacked proper nutrition; I was a skinny child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1979">Q: Did you know that you were supposed to menstruate?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1981">A: But of course!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1983">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1984">And were you nervous about the fact that...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1987">A: No, I was glad!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1989">Q: [chuckles]</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1997">A: No, I know that they didn't because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - I repeat that like an ignoramus because I don't know what it means - but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they used to say that the soup, the so-called soup that we were given, had brom in it.</sentence><sentence id="1998">Now, I don't know what brom is - and this was some kind of a - whatever it was, a medication or whatever - that that prevented women from menstruating.</sentence><sentence id="1999">I have no idea, I am just repeating it as I heard it.</sentence><sentence id="2000">So, I know that the women did not menstruate.</sentence><sentence id="2001">Why, I wouldn't know, and whether it was due to some concoction or an agent or a chemical being put in the food, I couldn't tell, but I knew that much.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2113">Q: Renia, how would you describe your relationship with your two other sisters at this point?</sentence><sentence id="2114">I mean, they're sort of... Do each of you have a different role at this point, I mean, could you describe it that way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2117">A In a sense, yes, and in a sense, no, because as far as I'm concerned personally, I was always at the receiving end, meaning I received all the love, and I received all the protection, and I received all the care and all everything.</sentence><sentence id="2118">I was the one really who most likely contributed list to the general survival scheme, or whatever you call it.</sentence><sentence id="2119">I was on the receiving end of it most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="2120">I adored my sisters.</sentence><sentence id="2121">Krysia, Chris, my next higher than I sister, was always the practical kind and always very wise in organizing and assessing, so... Hania was sort of in the clouds.</sentence><sentence id="2122">She was very smart and very brilliant, but she was always sort of - she was catered to, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2123">In those days, if you had a very smart person in the family, you had to defer to that person because you couldn't disturb the genius at work.</sentence><sentence id="2124">So, it sort of carried over to her... Not that she was a sponger of any kind - it's just that she was really at a certain level of higher existence that she didn't really have to so much worry about everyday things.</sentence><sentence id="2125">So that basically, Chris was the one who pulled the two of us toward the center, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2126">And Hania was very bright and very intelligent, and understood most everything better than I do anytime, but we loved each other a whole lot, and the fact that we were now separated from our parents - now, I'm saying separated because we were still separated from our father but we knew he was around and saw him every now and then and would wave to him, and we were separated from our mother because we really did not know what death was all about.</sentence><sentence id="2127">So, we deluded ourselves that, well, this resettlement, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2128">Having seen so many people resettled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in our own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, we knew what resettlement was all about.</sentence><sentence id="2129">People were being shifted here and there, and so Mother was shifted somewhere else, and everything is going to come out fine, because when everything ends, she will show up.</sentence><sentence id="2130">So, basically, we were even closer as a unit now than we ever were.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And, I must say, I contributed only by the fact that I was there, and they felt that they had to protect me, and so that was a little more mortar to the binding.</sentence><sentence id="2132">But I was not the planner; I was not a - I didn't visualize things in practical terms.</sentence><sentence id="2133">I understood the situation very well, having now seen what was transpiring, but how that applied to anything; it really didn't, not in my little world, because this was all stuff 1 didn't know how to deal with.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Besides, I had these two protectors.</sentence><sentence id="2135">First I had my two parents; I was always the tag-along.</sentence><sentence id="2136">Now, Hania and Krysia were sort of protecting me.</sentence><sentence id="2137">So, I just had to see that I stayed out of trouble, that I was alert at all times to what was around me, that I understood the danger, that I understood how to handle myself, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2138">And the rest, I knew I was being provided with the love and protection.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And that truly was how I really survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="2140">Not on my own account in any way.</sentence><sentence id="2141">I don't take credit for survival at all, truly.</sentence><sentence id="2142">That is how I actually saw myself.</sentence><sentence id="2143">I saw to it that I really should know what was going on and try to avoid getting into trouble, meaning situations that had no <span class="DLF">exit</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2173">Q: Why wouldn't you consider that - I don't want to call it a survival strategy - but why wouldn't you consider that things that you actually did?</sentence><sentence id="2174">You had to watch, because...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2177">A: But I was not responsible for anybody but myself, don't you see?</sentence><sentence id="2178">In the way we were brought up, watching out for yourself wasn't the greatest thing in the world that you want to do, because you really always needed to think of that other person.</sentence><sentence id="2179">But by virtue of being at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, and not being terribly attuned to realities and not being old enough to understand it all and put it together, I could understand the danger and the fear, but I couldn't relate it to the fact that I was doing anything special, because I wasn't doing anything for anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2180">I was trying to keep myself alive by seeing that I survived, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2181">That's about it.</sentence><sentence id="2182">Not by harming anybody, not by doing anything special, but by just watching out, and of course, to keep control of the fear, which was a task of itself.</sentence><sentence id="2183">Controlling your fear is extremely hard, if you see if your fear is legitimate, it's extremely hard to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2191">Q: Could you control your fear?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2193">A: At certain times I could, at certain I could not.</sentence><sentence id="2194">Like the time when I was alone going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2195">But my fear was uncontrollable, but there was double fear of what would happen if I didn't control myself - because everybody was just falling by the wayside.</sentence><sentence id="2196">You see, that much I understood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2201">Q: Were there other kids about your age in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2205">Q: There were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2207">A: Not only, you know, I imagine you must have heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="2208">Not only were they in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they were basically smuggled into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2209">They were outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with Christians, or however they were smuggled.</sentence><sentence id="2210">These kids eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, five and seven year old kids, survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and one of them is still alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2211">But three of these little kids that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> after the war, were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, so you heard about that.</sentence><sentence id="2212">I think the name was - Hania reminded me - Eisenmann (ph) - and Wolfowicz (ph) was the man that was the boss of the laundry where I worked, so Wolfowicz (ph) I think had two children.</sentence><sentence id="2213">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you see, he smuggled them in and they lived in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span> or whatever, but I knew of the Wolfowicz (ph) kids.</sentence><sentence id="2214">And they survived the evacuation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and everything that came after, and they came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and they were killed after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2223">Q: Do you have any idea why they smuggled the kids into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from these <span class="NPIP">places</span> they were being hidden?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2227">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2228">I just knew, because they were in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> to get them in, because they bribed someone or something.</sentence><sentence id="2229">I know that Mr. Wolfowicz (ph) was my boss in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span>, and his kids - he had two kids - so, I don't know how many there was - I don't know, less than ten - and they did survived.</sentence><sentence id="2230">They were five-year-old kids.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2235">Q: But how about children your age, young adults?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2237">A: Yeah, they were, they were, some of them survived, down in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2247">Q: So, do you have friends <span class="NPIP">outside</span> your two sisters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: Oh, yes, yes, my peers.</sentence><sentence id="2250">For example, the girl in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span>, Rachelka Shacter (ph), she was a very good friend.</sentence><sentence id="2251">Then I had my Hania Tenser (ph), she was the one who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to testify that she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, and she was my friend.</sentence><sentence id="2252">Yes, I had - you know - they were all kids, but you know, a fourteen, thirteen year old kid can work pretty well in the laundry, believe me, and that was just as well slave labor as anything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2257">Q: Now, I'm going to go back to a question I asked you a long time ago, because you interpreted it somewhat differently than I had intended it.</sentence><sentence id="2258">Do you now, when you're in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span>, in some sense reap the benefits of having been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with your sister teaching you, because you kept learning things?</sentence><sentence id="2259">Did these things go through your head?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2263">Do you replay the books in your head, and poetry?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2264">A: Oh, yes, most of all poetry.</sentence><sentence id="2265">I am absolutely crazy about poetry.</sentence><sentence id="2266">And, you know, the amazing thing is that the emphasis on learning things by rote, by heart, was very strong in my schooling years, and Hania kept on the same way, so I actually remember a whole lot of Polish poetry, I remember sections of Shakespeare in Polish, and you know, in the hardest of times - to this day I can recite poetry that I wouldn't even believe that I would.</sentence><sentence id="2267">There is a Polish epic, Pan Tadeusz, that of course I must have read a million times now already, but I do read it - it's one of the greatest works.</sentence><sentence id="2268">Anyway, I went to see the movie based on that - it was released about two years ago, by Andrzej Wajda, the director, and they stuck very close to the script and used at least 80% of the poetry as was the epic.</sentence><sentence id="2269">I was sitting in the movie with Victor - of course, Victor doesn't speak Polish, but he enjoyed the movie subtitles - and I am reciting with the movie, I am reciting Pan Tadeusz because I exactly know what's going to come.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And he walks into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he looks around and he sees the grandfather clock, and he recites this poem about his connection 6 to the grandfather clock, and I am going right along with him, and I know one <span class="DLF">line</span> ahead of him all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2271">So, those things sustained me, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And I didn't see it - again, it's a connection, where it's going to lead me.</sentence><sentence id="2273">This was like nourishment; perhaps that's how I should have put that - that learning for its own sake, if it was pleasurable, was the greatest pleasure.</sentence><sentence id="2274">So, when you're down and out, what else but to draw on this something that was so pleasurable.</sentence><sentence id="2275">And it was personal, intimate, because you didn't have to find a book, you didn't have to rely on the movies or on other people - all you had to do was start reciting in your head that poem - and there were so many, because we were forced to memorize good poetry, really.</sentence><sentence id="2276">So, that was, to this day, I absolutely have every piece of poetry that I love, I have it now, and I re-read it, strangely enough.</sentence><sentence id="2277">I enjoy it and I enjoy it and there is no end to the enjoyment, and that could have been part of what I call this lifting up the soul.</sentence><sentence id="2278">Again, you see, it doesn't - I'm sorry that I don't answer, didn't answer your question to your satisfaction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2294">Q: No, no, no, no, no - that's not what I said.</sentence><sentence id="2295">You interpreted it differently; it wasn't that you didn't answer it to my satisfaction.</sentence><sentence id="2296">It's just that I had a slightly different intention, and it was very interesting to hear where you took it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2300">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2302">Q: But perhaps I asked it too early.</sentence><sentence id="2303">Asking you now is maybe more appropriate.</sentence><sentence id="2304">Is there any poem that you recall repeating to yourself a lot there, that you could repeat for us, that was really important?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2308">A: No, no, mostly it was Mickiewicz or Tuwim - I don't know if you've heard of him.</sentence><sentence id="2309">Mickiewicz was a 19" century poet of Polish origin, but Lithuanian, he came out of, when <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was part of - heavily Polish.</sentence><sentence id="2310">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuwim</span> was contemporary, and he wrote children's poems, and he was a Jew, a Polish Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2311">And his poetry was very much taught in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2312">Mickiewicz, of course, and there was Slowacki, and there were all other important poets, but they were 18"/19(tm) century poets.</sentence><sentence id="2313">Twentieth century poet was Julian Tuwin, who was a Jew by birth, and every kid knew his poetry.</sentence><sentence id="2314">In fact, when our parents had company and they wanted to show off the kid, they would come and say, "Hey, hey, say that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> poem by Tuwim."</sentence><sentence id="2315">You showed off that because it was such beautiful poetry.</sentence><sentence id="2316">And, so I have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuwim</span>, I have him.</sentence><sentence id="2317">Unfortunately, I didn't quite agree with the way his life turned out, because he sort of - he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> during the war and then went back to Communist Poland.</sentence><sentence id="2318">He had left this .</sentence><sentence id="2319">Not that it means anything in the broader sense.</sentence><sentence id="2320">He was nevertheless the greatest poet of the 20"... one of the great, outstanding Polish poets of the 20" century was Julian Tuwim.</sentence><sentence id="2321">They're trying to rehabilitate him now, but his poetry lives on, so who cares, whatever the background.</sentence><sentence id="2322">So, you know, all of those little poems and big poems would come back, and they gave you a semblance of continuity of something that was, maybe you didn't lose it yet.</sentence><sentence id="2323">If you could remember that poem that your mother made you recite at that party, you know, and the connection, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2324">And of course, you know, children, you had to curtsey for your parents" friends; you had to curtsey.</sentence><sentence id="2325">So, when you came to make a big presentation, she 7 called you in, you had to curtsey and say the poem, and then would curtsey and walk out.</sentence><sentence id="2326">So, if it was possible, which it was, to make the mental connection from the present situation which I found myself in to this thing that was once sort of part of the other life, that was great.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And if you call it the thread that sustains you, fine, but that's what it really was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2348">Q: Were there any situations where there was a public sharing of poetry or singing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2350">A: Yes, a lot of times, because, as I told you, Polish education required you to know certain poems, period.</sentence><sentence id="2351">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="2352">So, this is how it was, that if you started, somebody else chimed in, somebody else sung.</sentence><sentence id="2353">There was a lot of singing; it was good.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2506">A: That was most horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="2507">Horrendous isn't the word, because it was summertime, you know, it was the end of July 1942...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2578">A: No, I don't, no, the only thing I remember distinctly having seen Father on the <span class="DLF">platform</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2579">But after that, I remember they were rushing us much in the so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> or whatever you call that.</sentence><sentence id="2580">And maybe Hania, Anna, would tell you about how she objected to being pushed and shoved and screamed at and for that they shaved off her hair, whereas our hair was just chopped off.</sentence><sentence id="2581">They grabbed you by the hair, they put the scissors to it, and however it came it came, but they didn't shave your head, they didn't give you a haircut, they just chopped off some hair, whereas Hania and her friend Irene Muller, Irka Muller (ph), who is now Irene Ross, both very tall, Hania was with her and objected to the fact that she was being pushed on and screamed, and said, "Don't talk to me like this."</sentence><sentence id="2582">So, the woman in charge, she was a Czechoslovak woman, she said, "Just for that, I'1l show you what I can do."</sentence><sentence id="2583">And she put her on the side there, and they shaved off her hair and Irene's hair - total zero, you know, complete bald - and we burst out laughing, in total hysterics.</sentence><sentence id="2584">We thought it was just so funny, because the fun in it was not the fact that the hair was shaved, but because they were both tall and little heads on the top, you know, the pin on top.</sentence><sentence id="2585">And it was so grotesque that it really lent itself to absolute hilarity in these circumstances, so we just laughed ourselves hilariously silly to tears.</sentence><sentence id="2586">And we left that <span class="REGION">area</span>, as we were all herded out.</sentence><sentence id="2587">We left that <span class="REGION">area</span> with Hania shaved to zero and Krysia, Chris, and I just having our hair, as I said, just chopped off however, and...</sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean, not as near as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> or other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> that were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>, but we were within the <span class="REGION">area</span> that could be contacted very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2744">However, they didn't because Stalin sat himself down and waited for the Germans to finish off the job.</sentence><sentence id="2745">So, all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that were being emptied, we realized 5 that something was happening from the east.</sentence><sentence id="2746">But how much could you know when you're living behind <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, and now you're coming here, and you see all these other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, and everybody else is there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2771">A: Well, Pll tell you, all these fancy words of "quarantine" and all this other thing, you only knew that there were all kinds of new horrors coming, so one horror was of this nature and one horror was of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="2772">Personally, as I told you, I could not figure out what it led to or what it led from or how it figured in the larger picture.</sentence><sentence id="2773">I didn't know if they meant to keep us there for a month or for a year or forever or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2774">But having now acquired enough experience to see that nothing is certain, that nothing is permanent, that everything changes, and it always changes for the worse, because so far in our experience, nothing changes for the better.</sentence><sentence id="2775">It was all downhill and by some miracle, we managed to stay together, which was altogether a miracle, altogether the most unbelievable miracle.</sentence><sentence id="2776">So, that we knew was a lucky break, that one, but everything else was just pure horror.</sentence><sentence id="2777">And this was just another thing, and God only knows what the next thing was going to be.</sentence><sentence id="2778">And that horrendous smell of burning flesh was really... well, sort of like very ominous in the sense that that is maybe after all going to be, you know, the final, the final, the tail end part of this horrible journey, who knows - we didn't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

I polished her boots and I'm sure she never knew which one of those ugly looking people I was.</sentence><sentence id="2970">So, there were no repercussions to it in a sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2997">Q: So, she didn't take it out on you later?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3033">Q: It gets bigger and bigger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A: Yeah, the circle, so to say, is getting enlarged, and now I have other things to worry about, because just because she's not a Nazi doesn't mean she can't kill me, "cause she can, and get away with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3041">Q: Let me go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> for a moment, because I realize that - I wonder if there are any comparable incidents for you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> - not necessarily of being humiliated, but maybe humiliated or beaten, or were there people that you were as afraid of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> as you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3043">A: You know, I don't really remember, but I do know that I felt - probably, I would guess I would have felt less fear in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> was still <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and Father was still on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> and it was really <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, even though there was no semblance to life or <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or anything, this was the place that was a familiar - not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a familiar <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3044"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a totally different situation, where everything was threatening from Day 1.</sentence><sentence id="3045">The mixture of fatherless; the total terror being surrounded by electrical barbed wire; by a system in place - you know, I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice camps</span> were run sort of ad hoc, if you know what I mean.</sentence><sentence id="3046">Run it as well as you can, and if you can't, then shoot a few and kill a few and run it.</sentence><sentence id="3047">This was organized murder, planned, executed and otherwise set up to the last detail.</sentence><sentence id="3048">And then you get thrown into a situation of different nationalities, so you are beginning to understand the scope of this entire drama - it's not a drama - of this entire epic is much larger.</sentence><sentence id="3049">It isn't a little Starachowice slave labor camp that is kept to produce war machinery, where just soldiers fight each other.</sentence><sentence id="3050">This is another aspect of something that is not yet even known or comprehended or - it doesn't seem to serve a purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3051">You see, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, you could always rationalize: "They have to keep these slave laborers; otherwise, they cannot win the war.</sentence><sentence id="3052">If they don't produce the cannon shells, the war cannot be won, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3053">They cannot fight the war."</sentence><sentence id="3054">So, however you slice it, these people are not expendable because somebody has to produce war material.</sentence><sentence id="3055">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, there's no such reasoning available to you because you realize this <span class="NPIP">place</span> is like a dead end.</sentence><sentence id="3056">It has no function as far as doing something for any reasonable kind of an end.</sentence><sentence id="3057">It doesn't produce war material.</sentence><sentence id="3058">It doesn't do anything to fight the Germans... er...to help the Germans to fight the war.</sentence><sentence id="3059">It houses people who are getting killed.</sentence><sentence id="3060">Nobody is doing anything except stupid things - if anything, cutting <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and, like Sisyphus, carrying back and forth the rocks from here to there.</sentence><sentence id="3061">We saw our Aunt Rose from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3062">One day we are on the <span class="DLF">line</span> carrying the rocks here and she was going with the rocks there and we waved to her.</sentence><sentence id="3063">We didn't know she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3064">So, you begin to understand, even as I was beginning now to more or less mature into this reality of what it was, that this is another story all together.</sentence><sentence id="3065">This is absolutely the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> for not just Starachowice people and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3066">It's the mixture people - you get Czech people and they brought in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> from Salernjica Grise (ph) and all kinds of people who, for all kinds of reasons who have nothing to do with punishment.</sentence><sentence id="3067">So, that's when it becomes obvious that that is another thing to contemplate.</sentence><sentence id="3068">So, basically, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, where you do not produce, cannot be explained away.</sentence><sentence id="3069">It must be confronted, even for somebody as - somebody who tries so hard to dismiss certain things, meaning, "Well, you know, tomorrow is another day, and this isn't so bad."</sentence><sentence id="3070">But it is.</sentence><sentence id="3071">It is.</sentence><sentence id="3072">Now you know it is so bad.</sentence><sentence id="3073">And, you know, we still don't know that Father perished, we don't 1 know that yet.</sentence><sentence id="3074">But the ambiance, and the work that is not work, and the food that isn't food, and the constant roll calls, and the threats if you don't show on roll call everybody else gets killed and all this, this has another dimension.</sentence><sentence id="3075">And this is when, I mean, you see, I have already learned to live with fear as part of - fear that could at least be used to motivate me to look out and to watch out, to see that I don't become a burden to my sisters and to see that I can maneuver somehow through.</sentence><sentence id="3076">But here, there is just somehow - things are cut off when we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because you don't see anything to justify your being there. ""</sentence><sentence id="3077">Why do they want me here?</sentence><sentence id="3078">Over there, they needed the laundry, but here they don't need anything.</sentence><sentence id="3079">They're just feeding you for nothing."</sentence><sentence id="3080">Which is another thing that I understood by then: you cannot be fed for nothing - whatever feeding that meant - but if you are fed, that means they permit you to live, and if they permit you to live, that means they have to use you for whatever you that have.</sentence><sentence id="3081">But here, there is nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="3082">I mean, it has no connection to all the things that you have already figured out, that I have already figured out.</sentence><sentence id="3083">So, I realized then that this would really be the end for us.</sentence><sentence id="3084">But I still didn't think that I would have to decide how to get out of it.</sentence><sentence id="3085">I felt Krysia and Hania would really protect me.</sentence><sentence id="3086">So, whatever happens, with three of us together.</sentence><sentence id="3087">But that was a dark hour; those were really dark hours in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the first period, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3088">Of course, it was getting colder, and after the quarantine we were sent to cut <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and it was getting much colder.</sentence><sentence id="3089">We were standing in water.</sentence><sentence id="3090">And it was physically getting to be - not that it was demeaning.</sentence><sentence id="3091">Nothing was demeaning anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3092">It was just the physical hardship was beginning to creep in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3144">Q: What were you wearing on your feet?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3146">A: I think we were wearing wooden shoes, and that was bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3148">Q: So, you were probably blistering up again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3150">A: Yes, and you know, working in the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>, we were in wetness always.</sentence><sentence id="3151">And this is by now probably October.</sentence><sentence id="3152">You know, it gets chilly in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3153">October is a very chilly month.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3158">Q: Did you know about the uprising and the blowing up of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> in October?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3160">A: Yes, the word got around.</sentence><sentence id="3161">I didn't know all the details, but I knew there was an uprising, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3162">Because, you see, we were now mixed in with all the other - the people who were longer and longest and we were the shorter and there were others the shortest.</sentence><sentence id="3163">You know, so this was already - we arrived in, let's say, August, early August, and this is October, and meanwhile others came after us, but there were now other people who came two years before us.</sentence><sentence id="3164">So, we were getting pretty - and nine people on the - you know, you could talk to your heart's content, because outside they wouldn't allow it maybe, but in the privacy of your nine people's perch, you can exchange information.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3172">Q: How did you notice the way people were relating to each other?</sentence><sentence id="3173">I mean, this is a situation of enormous deprivation, let alone terror and fear.</sentence><sentence id="3174">When you think about the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, did you see people fighting with each other, or screaming at each other, or stealing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3178">A: Yes, definitely, yes, but I didn't experience any of it.</sentence><sentence id="3179">I don't know, I really always talk about it, that human kindness is what I have actually depended on.</sentence><sentence id="3180">That I have - Somehow, people have always shown me a certain kind of deference - not deference because of anything that I represent, in fact, because I was skinny and undernourished and a poor little skinny kid.</sentence><sentence id="3181">So, everybody was taking pity on me, you know, so I always felt no matter where I went, there was always somebody taking pity on me to do this or to do that or to console me or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3182">We never had situations where we had to fight, but there were people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> absolutely who fought.</sentence><sentence id="3183">I mean, people would kill for a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="3184">And people would... But, you know, I always have this habit in me to analyze things, why would... "Well, maybe the Greek people, they understand things differently."</sentence><sentence id="3185">I was yet to grow up to understand that people are just people.</sentence><sentence id="3186">You can come from the <span class="REGION">North Pole</span> or the <span class="REGION">South Pole</span> or anywhere in between.</sentence><sentence id="3187">It's still the same people and it's exactly... The only thing is that in such unusual circumstances, different people reveal their character in a different way, so that some people who personify goodness become even better than goodness personified.</sentence><sentence id="3188">Others who have the beast in them become even more beastly.</sentence><sentence id="3189">You could see that among the Germans as well - those who turned a tender head when they could see something wasn't exactly according to the tule, and those who just waited for you to step out of the <span class="DLF">line</span>-up two inches because they were ready to kill, and they were ready, and you stepped out and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="3190">But those are all musings on a psychological kind of a reality that, in my own little world in those days - I could always depend on the Starachowice people who were still around, that I knew.</sentence><sentence id="3191">And we were still around, mixed with them.</sentence><sentence id="3192">And then there were others who were also riddled with fear.</sentence><sentence id="3193">And then there were others that I always felt that I didn't want to be near - I mean, prisoners, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3194">This was a world of its own, but a reflection of a bigger world, I guess, which is that human beings just are about the same everywhere, it's the circumstances that bring out in you whatever it is that you have in you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3212">Q: Did anyone ever surprise you, someone you thought was a good person turned out in that situation to be very difficult or harsh?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3214">A: I can't remember those things really.</sentence><sentence id="3215">I'm sure if I thought about it, I probably would dig it out somewhere in the recesses of my mind.</sentence><sentence id="3216">But at this point, no, I couldn't off-hand think of anybody, but I do know that, speaking in generalities, I could tell you that people always took pity on me and were nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="3217">That, I mean, I don't know how else to put that.</sentence><sentence id="3218">There was something about people that made them look after me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3224">Q: So you never found a circumstance where people actually resented the fact that you were so young and still survived?</sentence><sentence id="3225">Women who might have been older and had lost...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3228">A: No, quite the opposite.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3232">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3234">A: Quite the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="3235">Maybe I reminded them of their kid.</sentence><sentence id="3236">Whatever it was, but it was quite the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="3237">And I always said to myself it's because I look like that.</sentence><sentence id="3238">And I never fought my way to be first in <span class="DLF">line</span> or first to get food.</sentence><sentence id="3239">I always got sort of behind, I think.</sentence><sentence id="3240">That's very strange when I think about it, but that's how it was.</sentence><sentence id="3241">I did survive thanks to Chris and Hania, but I also survived thanks to the goodness of other people.</sentence><sentence id="3242">There's no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="3243">That absolutely is a fact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3254">Q: Did you ever get depressed during these first few months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3256">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3258">Q: You didn't?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3260">A: No, and I'll tell you why.</sentence><sentence id="3261">I was so preoccupied with survival.</sentence><sentence id="3262">First of all, I was filled with fear.</sentence><sentence id="3263">And out of the fear came the fact that I've got to manage.</sentence><sentence id="3264">And you cannot let yourself - not that you can't - I didn't - I couldn't - I just - whatever it was, whether I wouldn't allow myself or whether I knew that it wouldn't lead anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="3265">The fact was you had to face what it was and manage.</sentence><sentence id="3266">And that was what took up - you can't be depressed.</sentence><sentence id="3267">Because depressed means tomorrow they put a bullet through your head.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3276">Q: Did you see many depressed people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3278">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3279">I had already analyzed this before.</sentence><sentence id="3280">I think older people had a harder time than younger kids.</sentence><sentence id="3281">And I noticed this after the war, too, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3282">People who already lived a life, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3283">People who had lived, who were married or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3284">They were forever probably, I don't know, grieving for what - I mean, I didn't have time to grieve because I didn't live yet.</sentence><sentence id="3285">I didn't live yet, and all I knew was I had to watch out.</sentence><sentence id="3286">That was just to sum it up in a very plain way.</sentence><sentence id="3287">I had to watch out.</sentence><sentence id="3288">And other than that, depressed - I don't that that was even a concept that I could really even know what it was about.</sentence><sentence id="3289">I just knew that had to stay on the mark, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3290">Not to allow myself to do what is not supposed to be done, and not to allow myself to be called into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I knew would be trouble.</sentence><sentence id="3291">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="3292">And that was - you know, I think when prisoners are in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> who break out of a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, | think that's how they spend their days, thinking forever how to break out.</sentence><sentence id="3293">I had no idea how to break out, and I certainly wouldn't attempt it.</sentence><sentence id="3294">But the idea of how to stay on the mark, it was a total preoccupation, which, of course, included how to survive on the meager food.</sentence><sentence id="3295">It wasn't just the fear that could get you; it was the lack of food.</sentence><sentence id="3296">And don't forget, I was a growing child and did not get proper nutrition.</sentence><sentence id="3297">Other people required were hungrier than I because my body didn't require much, or maybe I was stupid to think that, but I really did not - I wasn't driven to insanity by hunger, because I was very hungry but my body tolerated it.</sentence><sentence id="3298">So, you see, this idea of depression, I don't know that I knew the meaning of it, because 4 life was too busy surviving.</sentence><sentence id="3299">And in any way of pushing my way or whatever; just minding my person.</sentence><sentence id="3300">And that's about all I can tell you about depression.</sentence><sentence id="3301">I will tell you 100% it was a totally foreign concept to me, if I even knew what it meant - I probably didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3326">Q: Do you have vivid recollections of the food?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3328">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3329">I'll tell you what, I used to use... I'll tell you now, because Victor, my husband Victor, loved turnips.</sentence><sentence id="3330">When we got married, he said, "Oh, I'd love for you to cook turnips."</sentence><sentence id="3331">And I said, "One thing I'm going to tell you right now," because you know he's American-born, three generations.</sentence><sentence id="3332">And I said, "One thing - I'd cook anything and everything.</sentence><sentence id="3333">Please don't ask me to cook turnips."</sentence><sentence id="3334">And he said, "Why not?</sentence><sentence id="3335">It's a very good food."</sentence><sentence id="3336">And I said, "Listen, I have an association with the smell of turnips and I will never get over it, not ever.</sentence><sentence id="3337">Please don't ask me to cook it.</sentence><sentence id="3338">I will not cook it.</sentence><sentence id="3339">If you want turnips, you will have to go to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3340">Because, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the only thing you ever got was turnips in a soup.</sentence><sentence id="3341">The turnips, of course, were never washed, so you had the sand and the peel, and the turnip.</sentence><sentence id="3342">If you found a piece of turnip, it was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="3343">But the - I can't say fragrance.</sentence><sentence id="3344">That's too fancy.</sentence><sentence id="3345">But the smell of the turnip is so deeply ingrained with me with that period, that I truly cannot stand - not the sight of turnip, I wouldn't know, because it looks like a sweet potato.</sentence><sentence id="3346">If you cook it properly and away from me, maybe I wouldn't know until I tasted it.</sentence><sentence id="3347">But absolutely that is what remained - the business with the turnips.</sentence><sentence id="3348">That was food.</sentence><sentence id="3349">I think they gave out coffee once - Coffee with a capital "C" - that was the water with a little chicory in it, I guess, and a piece of bread and the turnip soup.</sentence><sentence id="3350">That was food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3374">Q: Did you ever have margarine on your food, or...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3376">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="3377">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="3378">I just know that there were other people who were always hungrier than I was.</sentence><sentence id="3379">I was very, very hungry, but I was not as hungry - I think Hania was always hungrier than I was.</sentence><sentence id="3380">She was always tall, very tall, I mean, as Polish women go, I mean, as people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> go, even Jewish, she was very tall, and I was just a skinny kid, but Hania was tall and I think her body required more food than mine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3386">Q: So, you think she suffered more than you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3388">A: I think so, and I knew people who really, truly suffered from hunger more than I. I used to dream about food.</sentence><sentence id="3389">You see, you asked me whether I had nightmares.</sentence><sentence id="3390">No.</sentence><sentence id="3391">You know what I dreamt about?</sentence><sentence id="3392">I dreamt about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table settings</span> my mother used to put out.</sentence><sentence id="3393">My mother used to love to serve elegantly.</sentence><sentence id="3394">I love to remember that.</sentence><sentence id="3395">And I remember this party and I remember the settings.</sentence><sentence id="3396">I remember the food that was on it, but the settings, I was obsessed with the settings, in my dreams, in my recollections of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3397">So, that was really, that was part of getting fed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3410">Q: So, I'm going to take you back, just because you mentioned this, talk about being stimulated to go back for a moment to another <span class="NPIP">time</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3411">Chris, when she talked about the first night that you came back after you had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when the war started, and you came back.</sentence><sentence id="3412">The first meal back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, she claims that your father said, "We are going to set the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a tablecloth and a formal setting," even though you had very little food.</sentence><sentence id="3413">You do remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3418">A: Yes, absolutely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3420">Q: It's quite extraordinary.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3422">A: Yes, as a matter of fact, as time went on, and we would always have proper settings and there was not much to eat - a boiled potato - because that kept a semblance of a life.</sentence><sentence id="3423">But, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you could dream about it.</sentence><sentence id="3424">I mean, Mother used to set beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> - I don't mean during the war.</sentence><sentence id="3425">But you know, I even dreamt about sugar cookies, those sweet... sweet... beet...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3430">Q: Sugar beet?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3432">A: Yes, sugar beet cookies, because when she learned to bake that during the war, I even dreamt about that, and that's quite a leap from looking at an elegant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3434">Q: Do you remember people having conversations about food?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3436">A: Oh, all the time, all the time, all the time people used to talk about food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3438">Q: And what kind of a conversation was it?</sentence><sentence id="3439">Did people exchange recipes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3442">A: Yes, they talked about recipes.</sentence><sentence id="3443">They talked about what they saw in <span class="DLF">display windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3444">If they happened to be from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, "Oh, you remember, this pastry that had this display of every day fresh..." Whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3445">Absolutely, all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3450">Q: Now, how did that function for people?</sentence><sentence id="3451">I do know one survivor felt like "we ate with our talk", or something.</sentence><sentence id="3452">It was as if the talk was a substitute.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3456">A: It was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3458">Q: But it didn't hurt more or make you more hungry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3460">A: No, I'll give you an analogy.</sentence><sentence id="3461">When I cook, you know, I like to cook, I used to cook fancier because now we're eating all this other simpler stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3462">But in the days when I was cooking, and I would have a party, whatever, I would have no time to eat, and I was so hungry, hungry, but I had to cook, so I said, "Well, let me first start cooking."</sentence><sentence id="3463">And by the time I was done cooking all these French dishes with the wine and all, I was so satiated 6 from the fragrance, this beautiful fragrance of the food, that by the time I was done with cooking, I really didn't need to eat.</sentence><sentence id="3464">I definitely didn't need to eat because the idea plus the fragrance, the wonderful wine cooking, would fill me.</sentence><sentence id="3465">That is analogous to the fact that, if you, perhaps, if you talked of food that was really part of another <span class="NPIP">setting</span>, and I don't mean food just for the eating of it, but for the sustenance and the other thing that comes with food, that that could fill you.</sentence><sentence id="3466">Not for long, because eventually, five, six hours later you still would wake up hungry and famished, but that is the only analogy that I could think of.</sentence><sentence id="3467">And it is true.</sentence><sentence id="3468">It is absolutely true because people were talking all the time about food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3478">Q: And you, too?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3480">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3481">You know, people were describing this or these people talking about ptishye (ph), which were like profiteroles au chocolat, so you remember, and then it filled you.</sentence><sentence id="3482">So, I guess there has to be something to it if so many people did it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3486">Q: Did you see a lot people smoking, women smoking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3488">A: No, I don't think there were any cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="3489">I remember that during the war they used to roll in a piece of paper and I don't even think they had tobacco; I think they had crushed leaves or something.</sentence><sentence id="3490">My father was a smoker, though, but not my mother.</sentence><sentence id="3491">Women, I don't remember that women smoke.</sentence><sentence id="3492">Or maybe they did, but certainly not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3498">Q: No, that's what I meant: did you ever see women using cigarettes to barter for other things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3500">A: Oh, to barter, yes, not to smoke.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3502">Q: Oh, to <span class="BUILDING">barter</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3504">A: To barter, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="3505">Let's say you wanted a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="3506">So, you sold a scarf to get a turnip, then you exchange the turnip for cigarettes, and then you barter the cigarettes for bread.</sentence><sentence id="3507">You see how that went?</sentence><sentence id="3508">You were a non-smoker.</sentence><sentence id="3509">The cigarette was a means of getting the bread in a circuitous way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3516">Q: So, cigarettes were very valuable?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3552">Q: So, you were not afraid of any kind of sexual...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3554">A: No, how could I be, considering who I was and how I looked and who, I guess, would look at me?</sentence><sentence id="3555">That was never, ever... Later on, when we were past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> and after the Liberation, that's a story further on, when we were inside of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the Russians came, and we were warned that they rape women, so we should run away and we should not stay there.</sentence><sentence id="3556">That's as far, but, but even by then, I didn't ever think of it.</sentence><sentence id="3557">The only thing that I was afraid of in - unless other women experienced it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - that if you were sick and had to stay behind on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, and you couldn't go to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, to work, like in the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> like we did, that they would come and drag you out and they would do with you what they wanted to do with you, whatever that meant, but I guess that meant probably more of being killed than... Yes, but you see after the Auschwitz detail left, and <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> had to be emptied, they went through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to see if anyone was hiding because sick people who couldn't make it to the roll call... So if they found you, they took you whenever they took you, but that was never, ever an issue, not with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3562">Q: Do you remember the day when Chris was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and told to take her two sisters, when you are given this, what ends up being a very protected job?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3564">A: You mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3565">Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3568">Q: Can you describe that day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3570">A: Well, in fact, somebody just reminded me that Chris and Hania actually were asked for the jobs and I wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="3571">I was going to be left behind.</sentence><sentence id="3572">No, this was an <span class="DLF">opening</span> in - maybe I'll sort of put a frame around it - We are now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> since, let's say, early August.</sentence><sentence id="3573">We have been in quarantine and we have worked in the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and it's getting very much colder, very much, because winter is setting in.</sentence><sentence id="3574">There is a detail of women that is to be sent to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they sort clothes that is left behind by political prisoners, not Jews, not Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3575">We don't yet know why or how, but they request, I think, thirty women or whatever to be sent there.</sentence><sentence id="3576">So Krysia and Hania are picked for the detail, and I am not to be in the detail because I am small.</sentence><sentence id="3577">So, somebody intervened on my behalf and she 9 said, "She is a hard worker and she's very smart.</sentence><sentence id="3578">She would be very good."</sentence><sentence id="3579">So, instead of thirty, they let go thirty-one.</sentence><sentence id="3580">And we arrived... The first week, we went to work and came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, or maybe the first two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="3581">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="3582">But in the beginning, we went there and then came back.</sentence><sentence id="3583">What we found out is that the women at that job, that's still Auschwitz property, except this is a sort of a separate unit - that the women, political prisoners, were somehow involved in the Polish underground or they were in cahoots or whatever, so they were shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="3584">So, now, they didn't want any more Polish women Christians; they wanted the safer type, which is from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3585">So, again, as I said, I don't know if it was a week or two weeks or three weeks - whatever it was, originally we went there and back, there and back at night.</sentence><sentence id="3586">Eventually, we didn't go back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>; we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="3587">And that was a <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> sent.</sentence><sentence id="3588">First of all, if got cold <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3589">We didn't have to go to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3590">Second of all, we were dressed now properly; you see, because we were next to those piles of clothes, so we could pick what we had, what we could wear.</sentence><sentence id="3591">And now it was getting colder, so shoes were very important - very.</sentence><sentence id="3592">So, we had warmer clothing, better shoes, and we worked at that detail, and these women were a very interesting group.</sentence><sentence id="3593">They were all very intelligent, and they had real political connections.</sentence><sentence id="3594">Some of them - we discovered one of them, Christina Jevulsha (ph), that she was Jewish actually, but she was a Polish political prisoner, passing for a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="3595">Anyhow, we worked at that detail up to the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the death march, and that really saved our life because we were already getting terribly run down from the outdoor work in the <span class="DLF">marshes</span>, you see, and now it was getting worse because the winter was coming.</sentence><sentence id="3596">And because we worked in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> - probably two months or so - and we slept <span class="NPIP">indoors</span> and we worked <span class="NPIP">indoors</span>, and we were wearing better clothes.</sentence><sentence id="3597">So when the death march, the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> took place, we walked out on the death march wearing proper clothes, meaning warm clothes for winter, and our health was restored because we didn't work <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>, and I think the food was a little better, too, although I do not remember exactly what the feeding was, how they - it was institutional food, and it was doled out, but it probably was a little more than the turnip soup with the sand in it.</sentence><sentence id="3598">And that - you know, it seems, in that whole saga of this war experience, it seems that there were already a little - there was a little interval that allowed us a little <span class="INT_SPACE">breathing space</span> which restored the soul and the body before we would face the other horror.</sentence><sentence id="3599">So, luckily, that stretch of time - which wasn't more than probably two months - allowed us to really, by not working <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>, not to really come down with whatever, you see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: Did it surprise you that, in the context of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, there would be kommandos that would not have selections, that you really were not only protected from the elements, but protected from what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3632">A: Yes, very much.</sentence><sentence id="3633">But, you see, this was such an exceptional setting which was totally strange to us.</sentence><sentence id="3634">The clothes of political prisoners were hung up, numbered.</sentence><sentence id="3635">If a political prisoner died, the stuff had been packed and sent to the family.</sentence><sentence id="3636">If a political prisoner was transferred, the clothes traveled after them.</sentence><sentence id="3637">We were engaged in packing.</sentence><sentence id="3638">And of course, <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> help you if you stole something or took a thread out of it.</sentence><sentence id="3639">And the fact remains 0 that I couldn't imagine that a thing like that existed.</sentence><sentence id="3640">Send the clothes of that prisoner back to the family?</sentence><sentence id="3641">I still don't understand it in the scheme of the genocide, of the Nazi genocide, why that was done.</sentence><sentence id="3642">I mean, these were Christian, obviously, but what was the importance of sending the clothes back to the families?</sentence><sentence id="3643">After all the harassment and the inhumanity that they have shown the human beings, that they should be concerned about clothes being... I just, it doesn't, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3644">But luckily for us, that was the case.</sentence><sentence id="3645">And so I learned to pack.</sentence><sentence id="3646">But that was, it was good because we were in a more civilized <span class="NPIP">setting</span>, to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="3647">These Polish women were very good.</sentence><sentence id="3648">They were very intelligent and there was very little of that animosity, the Polish-Jewish type, no, this was rather...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3666">Q: These were also old-timers who remained there.</sentence><sentence id="3667">They had been there awhile.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3670">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3671">I think most of them were shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="3672">I think thirty or thirty-one were shipped out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3676">Q: But there was a group that was still there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3678">A: Yes, somebody had to be left behind to show the newcomers.</sentence><sentence id="3679">But I do know that they were in touch with other Polish prisoners, but, of course, we never were aware of really, of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3680">But I do know now that they had contact with the Polish underground.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3684">Q: Do you have any idea how come Hania and Chris were chosen out of all the women in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3686">A: Yes, the woman who did help us wrote a book about it.</sentence><sentence id="3687">She liked us, so writes in the book that we were not the pugnacious type, and she noticed that other people knew how to fight their way out and way in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3690">Q: Who is she?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3692">A: Felicia Hyatt, Felicia Berlant Hyatt (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3693">She was a scribe in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and she took a liking to us.</sentence><sentence id="3694">And she, when the request came for people, she picked us, and she was the one who was instrumental in my being attached to this detail.</sentence><sentence id="3695">And she wrote not a very nice chapter, it's in her book, it's called Short Calls...something Calls, what is it...Close Calls.</sentence><sentence id="3696">And so she was instrumental in that she took a liking to us, she said they were intelligent girls and we didn't know how to fight our way out so, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3697">She says that in the book.</sentence><sentence id="3698">So, anyhow, that's how we ended up there, and that was a lifesaver.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3706">Q: So, then there's going to be an evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3708">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3710">Q: Did you have - I don't know how to use the word - to stay, or to go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3714">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3716">Q: No choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3718">A: No, the only choice we were given to others who did stays, was like my friend Hannah Tenser from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, who was left in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> because they ran out of gas, or other people who were too sick to move; they were left behind as refuse.</sentence><sentence id="3719">But we were just marched out like everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="3720">But we were lucky that we were dressed well because it was January and it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="3721">So, I don't know that we would have made it.</sentence><sentence id="3722">Maybe we would have - other people did.</sentence><sentence id="3723">But it helped to have good shoes and to have good clothes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3730">Q: Did you have gloves?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3736">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3737">We had access to the piles of clothing that they wanted... You know, when we got there, they said take off everything you have on and go pick something that fits you - not from the prisoners but from the Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="3738">So, we had shoes to fit and clothes to fit and it was warm, because we were there toward, you know, in the winter.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3748">A: No, I only know that we went on a march, and I only know that I completely lost my mind.</sentence><sentence id="3749">And I fell asleep while walking.</sentence><sentence id="3750">I was sleepwalking.</sentence><sentence id="3751">I absolutely fell asleep, and Chris and Hania were dragging me.</sentence><sentence id="3752">And the whole march is one - it's not a nightmare, it's completely obliterated except for what I remember: the snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, we were marching down a <span class="DLF">country road</span> or whatever, with dark <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on each side and snow in the middle, and it seemed like a <span class="NPIP">place</span> - an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3753">So, I was walking and they were dragging me, but I was dead asleep, totally.</sentence><sentence id="3754">And I always talk about it, when, every now and then, they would stop everybody to relieve himself, and Chris and Hania would squat down and tell me to relieve myself, but I wouldn't because I wasn't here; I was in the other reality, so that - it's true, and so finally...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3794">A: I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="3795">I walked as much as I could and the rest I slept.</sentence><sentence id="3796">I know one thing which I am very proud of.</sentence><sentence id="3797">When we got to a certain big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with where to stay overnight, and I must have been terribly clumsy or horribly tired, and I wasn't moving right, and a German came and knocked me in my face - this is the second time, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="3798">I once got hit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> like this - with a ring; he was wearing a big signet ring, and he knocked me, and I fell right down at the <span class="DLF">barn door</span>, and everybody else was chased into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3799">I had the presence of mind when I woke up, when they started blowing whistles for everybody to get up, I had the presence of mind to stand by the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and found Krysia and Hania as they came out.</sentence><sentence id="3800">But that was...One day I have to have this made to...I have to account for it, how it came about that I slept through this march.</sentence><sentence id="3801">At least half the way I slept through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3810">Q: And also how to account for your two sisters having the strength to hold you for that long.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3822">A: Not sleepwalking, I was just sleeping.</sentence><sentence id="3823">I do remember that I never thought of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was as I was as the <span class="NPIP">place</span> I was in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3826">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3828">A: I thought that was somewhere - because, the dark <span class="DLF">skies</span> - we walked at night - and the dark <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and the white bottom.</sentence><sentence id="3829">So, I'm now in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3830">I'm not <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3831">You see, 3 I am not <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3832">I am somewhere in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>, walking down.</sentence><sentence id="3833">But how that jives with the reality, that I've never figured out, but that was a fact.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3842">A: No, they just dragged me.</sentence><sentence id="3843">I mean, there was no reason, I mean, to wake me, so if I opened my eyes - I probably had my eyes open, but I was sleeping.</sentence><sentence id="3844">I was really very much asleep.</sentence><sentence id="3845">Much of the trip, I was asleep, until we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span>, was it?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3920">A: Yes, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, as you know - this is about the end of January or so, early February - and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> was so overrun with people.</sentence><sentence id="3921">All these camps that were first evacuated from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and then from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into - they were just shoving them in.</sentence><sentence id="3922">They put up <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>; there were no more <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> available.</sentence><sentence id="3923">There were <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3924">So that it really, you were so, now - now we were completely disconnected from the original group.</sentence><sentence id="3925">We were still traveled - when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we were very much with the group - but because we were not evacuated with the Starachowice people, we came there with another group, and then we got mixed in with all kinds of nationalities and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">people camps</span> that you never heard of and that you did hear of and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3926">So, it didn't matter who you were.</sentence><sentence id="3927">You could have told them you were Roosevelt's daughter, you know, for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="3928">You could have picked out something out of the blue moon, or King Farouk's first wife, whatever, you see?</sentence><sentence id="3929">So, if Hania said that or Krysia said that, it must be so.</sentence><sentence id="3930">But, as I told you, it wasn't my decision.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3944">A: Very bad - it was the worst.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3946">Q: Worse than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3947">Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3950">A: Because it was disorganized.</sentence><sentence id="3951">Not that it was disorg-...It wasn't in any way planned to contain the number of people that were shipped in.</sentence><sentence id="3952">It was in no way organized with a plan for the future, even, because the war was now turning, you know, the war effort of the Allies was now taking shape.</sentence><sentence id="3953">So, that the Germans, whatever they were up to, knew only themselves, but the fact is that a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> that had all these people shipped in - and maybe the decision wasn't yet made what to do with that, with these people, I don't know - but the fact remains that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was overrun.</sentence><sentence id="3954">We stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3955">There were no more people possible to squeeze into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3956">You can imagine they accommodated you now in the <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> now, in the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>, because, I mean, this was beyond any setting, especially since they always were so organized in the - their genocidal plan included every detail on down the <span class="DLF">line</span>, and this was, of course, already USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0410 rs out of their hands.</sentence><sentence id="3957">So, that was rough; that was bad.</sentence><sentence id="3958">The food was - no food and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay in, and just chaos.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3974">A: I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="3975">I think we used snow, or something like this.</sentence><sentence id="3976">That could very well be.</sentence><sentence id="3977">Because we ate snow, and we probably cleaned ourselves with snow, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3982">Q: And did the registration include giving you a new number?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3984">A: I don't think so.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3988">A: Frankly, I don't even think they registered us.</sentence><sentence id="3989">I mean, if you consider what was happening at the time, with the influx of the people.</sentence><sentence id="3990">I really don't remember, I truly, I don't, but it was so chaotic that I can't imagine that they would still be able to count or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4022">A: Yes, in fact, we have a friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> whose mother we saw in the melee of people.</sentence><sentence id="4023">We saw out of nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="4024">Mrs. Linsburg, we ran into Mrs. Linsburg.</sentence><sentence id="4025">And years later, we told the daughter who survived, who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4026">She lost her mother somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> and she never found out what happened to her - No, her mother disappeared and she never know where.</sentence><sentence id="4027">And we told her, we saw her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4028">We just glanced at her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, because she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4029">But what happened after, we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4030">But I'm telling you, it was total chaos, so that it was just 6 impossible.</sentence><sentence id="4031">And people who were with each other, if they were separated, then that was the end of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4046">Q: You didn't know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4048">A: No, because we had to find out from the men, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4049">It's the men from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> who knew what happened.</sentence><sentence id="4050">I don't know at which point we found out about it.</sentence><sentence id="4051">I don't know, but we did have to find it out from the men.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4058">A: Probably, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4059">Or maybe we already knew.</sentence><sentence id="4060">I couldn't tell you for sure.</sentence><sentence id="4061">But I know that we did find out that he perished in October, October of 44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4066">Q: And by the time you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, have you decided that your mother is already dead?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4068">A: In all likelihood, we've thought that in all likelihood that she would not turn up because we'd seen too much and heard too much.</sentence><sentence id="4069">We heard too much.</sentence><sentence id="4070">You see, having now been mixed in with all the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, with the influx of people from every conceivable part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it was very easy to piece things together.</sentence><sentence id="4071">So that...we had a pretty good idea I think by then, but not a certainty, and certainly did not give up the idea that they might still be alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4110">A: Yes, I forgot.</sentence><sentence id="4111">She actually reminded me of it, but I remembered after she refreshed my memory.</sentence><sentence id="4112">I worked for the SS woman.</sentence><sentence id="4113">Our section, the women's section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> - of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span>, excuse me - was ran by SS women, and they were a category of their own, awful, brutal people.</sentence><sentence id="4114">And they of course needed servants, and I was one of the personal servants.</sentence><sentence id="4115">She lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4116">I did her laundry, I brought in wood to keep the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> going, you know, and cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4117">She took a liking to me, but I was still a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4118">And she would not come near me ever.</sentence><sentence id="4119">I would walk in, she would walk out.</sentence><sentence id="4120">And if she talked to me, she talked to me from another end of the - because she just wouldn't be near me.</sentence><sentence id="4121">So, then she started leaving crusts of bread for me.</sentence><sentence id="4122">She didn't like crusts.</sentence><sentence id="4123">So, she said, "I'll be leaving this crust.</sentence><sentence id="4124">If you find it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, that's for you."</sentence><sentence id="4125">And I said, "Thank you very much."</sentence><sentence id="4126">So, meanwhile, one day she came in and she says, "Did you find the crusts I left for you?"</sentence><sentence id="4127">I said, "Yes, thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="4128">| eat them."</sentence><sentence id="4129">And she says, "How are things going for you?</sentence><sentence id="4130">Who are you here with?</sentence><sentence id="4131">Do you know anybody, do you have family?"</sentence><sentence id="4132">And I said, "Yes, I have one sister who works in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, she cleans the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and then I have another sister, but she does not have a good job."</sentence><sentence id="4133">I forgot what Krysia did.</sentence><sentence id="4134">She says, "All right, I'll get her a good job."</sentence><sentence id="4135">So, Krysia was assigned to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and that was really a great, wonderful thing.</sentence><sentence id="4136">Of course, she was the most vicious thing, but in a very paradoxical way, I really benefited greatly toward my liberation from being her servant, because they were so - they lorded over everybody so you not only had to do for her and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4137">When the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> was organized, we had to carry their rucksacks.</sentence><sentence id="4138">They took their stuff, and we had to carry - the maids had to carry - not God forbid somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="4139">So, when we were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span>, as the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> was approaching, the Russians were approaching closer and closer; the war was already going toward the end.</sentence><sentence id="4140">I think this was by then probably April - end of March, early April.</sentence><sentence id="4141">When we found ourselves on the <span class="DLF">road</span> with all the evacuees of every <span class="DLF">stripe</span> and of every possible persuasion, because you had the Jewish prisoners of war - Jewish - you know, prisoners from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and you had Polish laborers who worked on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and you had German military and German out of uniform, and German civilians with dogs and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and whatever - we had to carry their stuff.</sentence><sentence id="4142">And then when it came to a point where the <span class="DLF">road</span> was so clogged up we couldn't move, they told us to sit down.</sentence><sentence id="4143">Well, we made a way - there were the few maids that were carrying the tucksacks - and by the way, I kept saying that there were twelve of us, but Hania reminded me it was ten, and Helena was one.</sentence><sentence id="4144">There was one woman there, Helena, she was blonde, one of the servants, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4145">She spoke German very well.</sentence><sentence id="4146">I think she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> or somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="4147">When we made it off the <span class="DLF">road</span>, the main <span class="DLF">road</span> where the evacuees were, I had this woman's rucksack with all her belongings, so in final analysis, I proved to be a skunk, because what Helena did - she was carrying somebody else's - and you know, they had those black capes, these women, they had black wool capes that they wore.</sentence><sentence id="4148">So, Helena put her cape, the cape over her clothes and put the woman's hat, and we 9 all decided... No, I didn't decide... But the ten of us, not the twelve, the ten of us who made it off the <span class="DLF">road</span>, onto the <span class="DLF">field</span> and away from the evacuees on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, were supposed to pretend that we are the prisoners and Helena was our guard, and she was guiding us - no, not guiding us.</sentence><sentence id="4149">Guarding us.</sentence><sentence id="4150">She was guarding us, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4151">So, we had the paraphernalia, the German paraphernalia.</sentence><sentence id="4152">So, she probably, in the final analysis, the SS woman, who trusted me, who took a liking, she probably said, "Well, like all the Jews, she betrayed me."</sentence><sentence id="4153">She was so vicious, she was very, very... But to me, she was absolutely wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4198">Q: And why do you think that was?</sentence><sentence id="4199">How do you explain that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4202">A: I cannot explain it.</sentence><sentence id="4203">I cannot explain it.</sentence><sentence id="4204">The mere fact that she didn't want to be near me but she left me crusts of bread, that she asked me if I have it well, if everything is fine, and if I have family, on the one hand.</sentence><sentence id="4205">And then on the other hand, I saw how what she did to other people.</sentence><sentence id="4206">So, I cannot explain it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4212">Q: You were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> for, what, a couple of months?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4214">A: From the time we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>, which probably was February or so, in February.</sentence><sentence id="4215">Yeah, about a couple of months, right, because the evacuation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> was about early April, for 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4218">Q: And, in addition to these crumbs of bread, was the food...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4220">A: Well, the food was better because - I really got ahead of my story - but I didn't say that after we - those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> - that brought us in, all the so-called <span class="NPIP">spots</span> were filled with us, maid and this and the other, women were brought in - in fact, some of the people we knew from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - were brought into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because there was an <span class="BUILDING">air force base</span>, a German air force base, not far, and they were digging anti-aircraft ditches or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4221">So, these laborers were supposed to be working for the - maybe not only the air force - no, <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, or whatever you call it.</sentence><sentence id="4222">Anyhow, once the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was filled, we found that there were people who we knew from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4223">And, of course, we had it very fine now, because having to work for the German women who didn't really want us to mingle with the population, so we slept in separate <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> under the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4224">So Krysia always brought down a little more bread, and so that was really fine.</sentence><sentence id="4225">And so we got restored again before the big evacuation on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4232">Q: I'm having an association.</sentence><sentence id="4233">There was a story that Krysia told about Hania in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that had to do with food.</sentence><sentence id="4234">Do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4238">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4239">Now, Chris remembers it much better, and I know that Hania fainted and all this, but I don't really recall this.</sentence><sentence id="4240">I only remember it because Chris told me about it.</sentence><sentence id="4241">I really truly didn't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="4242">I'm beginning, you know, as I analyze and think back, I really think I that I obliterated certain things from my mind.</sentence><sentence id="4243">Because I have a very distinct 0 recollection about certain things and none about other <span class="NPIP">things</span>, so there has to be some selective thinking here.</sentence><sentence id="4244">I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

So, very soon, we started toward the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going back east.</sentence><sentence id="4313">But that was easier said than done because everybody - people were so dislocated, and everybody wanted to get east, further east.</sentence><sentence id="4314">So, we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for a few stops, then we got bumped off.</sentence><sentence id="4315">And then, there were Russian soldiers riding and all sorts of other people, and then we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="4316">We didn't know where we were going, but we were going east, wherever the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will take us, as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bibgost</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4317"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bibgost</span> (ph) we knew was sort of a - what do you call it - a cross-, no, sort of a central line crossing.</sentence><sentence id="4318">We still didn't know - we thought we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="4319">We just said, "We'll make our way to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and from there, we'll worry about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4320">But we met a Russian soldier who was Jewish on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and he told us, if we're Jewish, not to go back, because it's not safe in those small - he asked us how big a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was, and we said, "Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="4321">And he said, "Don't go back;

we saw it; we were part of it.</sentence><sentence id="4340">We never really - of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we also knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> - but we had no idea about all these other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, where all this was happening at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="4341">So, the resettlement was a euphemism, and how the secrets were kept for all those years, when the Germans were committing the most heinous crime of all history, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4342">I don't know how that could altogether happen without people knowing, but that's how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="4343">And we settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, you know, after the war.</sentence><sentence id="4344">And Hania and Chris went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and I told you about Genia (ph), that maid of ours.</sentence><sentence id="4345">She absolutely said she had nothing, and she threatened them.</sentence><sentence id="4346">And Mrs.Paliszewska - that night, the little children that came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were killed in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4347">And Mrs. Paliszewska - one of women of the Paliszewska sisters worked at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, she sold tickets there, and they lived very near the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, so she secured tickets for them and put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4348">So, that was where the end of the war found us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4400">Q: Did this feel - on the one hand, you were liberated and free, and on the other hand, you find a world of tragedy - so, are you very conflicted about what you find?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4402">A Well, we are really in shock still, because we survived, and we still cannot figure out how it happened that we did survive.</sentence><sentence id="4403">We are not yet aware of the entire truth of everything.</sentence><sentence id="4404">Grandmother - after all, we had a tremendous family, extended family, on my mother's side especially.</sentence><sentence id="4405">Originally, there were nine children - I don't mean children - nine siblings, who had all the kids and their kids, and my father's family wasn't so large, but it was large, too.</sentence><sentence id="4406">So, eventually, we pieced it all together to find out that people perished.</sentence><sentence id="4407">But it really took many years before the truth came out because, as you know, people were reluctant to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="4408">Everybody was busy trying to live, to return to normal life, and nobody wanted - was willing to talk about Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4409">They just lived through it; why talk about it?</sentence><sentence id="4410">So that, not too many things were yet known, but we knew now for a fact that Mother had perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, because we knew that the transport out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span>, after the original evacuation of the Jewish population, from the square where they were segregated, that those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when straight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4411">So, we knew that.</sentence><sentence id="4412">Then we knew that a lot of people perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice camp</span>, and then they perished right along as we got along.</sentence><sentence id="4413">So, then, of course, it came out that there were such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where slave labor was not required.</sentence><sentence id="4414">The ultimate purpose of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was genocide, and that only Jews were being selected for that genocide.</sentence><sentence id="4415">So, that was a total eye-opener.</sentence><sentence id="4416">But, you know, life went on.</sentence><sentence id="4417">Chris met Miles and they got married, and they sort of adopted me, so I stayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="4418">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> while we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4419">Hania, Anna, went to <span class="BUILDING">school of diplomacy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4420">But we lived with Uncle Alexander - Miles, Chris, I and Uncle Alexander.</sentence><sentence id="4421">Uncle Alexander went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because his wife survived - she survived in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.315677" long="12.761583">Retzow</span> - but she was shipped out to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because she was quite ill at liberation time.</sentence><sentence id="4422">And that was - subsequently, Miles, Chris and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4423">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> from about March/April of "46 until January of "47, because we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> February 11", in 1947.</sentence><sentence id="4424">So, that chapter was closed.</sentence><sentence id="4425">We more or less knew how our parents perished.</sentence><sentence id="4426">We also found out from people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> what happened to Grandma and the aunts.</sentence><sentence id="4427">I had two aunts living there.</sentence><sentence id="4428">One was single, and the other, Regina - another Regina - Aunt Regina, who was married, and Angia, who wasn't married - they lived with the grandmother because they ran a <span class="BUILDING">printing shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4429">And so they went - Regina with her husband and Angia and Babka - and Grandma - they all were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, as well, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.616666" long="25.966666">Ostrowiec</span> was slated for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4430">And my father's family, only my cousin survived.</sentence><sentence id="4431">One aunt, I mean, Uncle Alexander survived with his wife, and then one of my father's sister's daughter, survived, and a cousin, Angia, who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4432">And the extended family numbered - I cannot begin to tell you because I wouldn't really know, but really, a very big number.</sentence><sentence id="4433">And we did have three uncles who escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the 20's.</sentence><sentence id="4434">Not escaped, but made their way out, because they were going to be conscripted.</sentence><sentence id="4435">So, they made their way out, and they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, so we eventually got in touch with them.</sentence><sentence id="4436">But as far as the Holocaust story of our family is concerned, I mean, this is in essence not just a narrative covering our survival, the three of us, but really, the extended family, how that was decimated.</sentence><sentence id="4437">Unfortunately, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4438">3 It was such a fine family, you know, my mother's big family.</sentence><sentence id="4439">But unfortunately that's all gone.</sentence><sentence id="4440">We've made peace with that, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4480">Q: For those, for those people who are watching this, there is a five-hour audio tape of life after the Holocaust which I think will cover an enormous amount of these years, from 1945 on.</sentence><sentence id="4481">I have one final question to ask you, and I don't know if it's too big a question or too small a question.</sentence><sentence id="4482">Do you look back - When you look back on your life, on this period, do you find a particular effect it has had on you or set of effects.</sentence><sentence id="4483">And let me give you one example from your sister Chris, because I thought was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="4484">Someone asked her why she only has two children, and she said, "Because I only have two hands.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4490">And if something happens, I have to be able to hold onto each child, and if I had a third arm, I would have three children."</sentence><sentence id="4491">Which I found a very interesting kind of effect.</sentence><sentence id="4492">And I'm wondering if there is something in you in terms of your life, how you have led your life since, what you feel and how it's affected you...?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4493">A: No, you see, I mentioned before in the interview that I felt older people had a harder time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and I also think they had a harder time after the war, whether adjusting to a new language, a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, a new culture, or whichever, or altogether, even if they went back to stay in Europe, adjusting to the emptiness, to the horror that was still in the soil, so to say, <span class="REGION">European soil</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4494">In my case, I found that, because I had never lived and I always wanted to taste life, I had no time.</sentence><sentence id="4495">I had absolutely - I came out of the war like a racing horse coming out of a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4496">I was ready and willing and raring to go.</sentence><sentence id="4497">I wasn't going to look back and I wasn't going to contemplate and I wasn't going to analyze, I wanted to live.</sentence><sentence id="4498">And I did.</sentence><sentence id="4499">Everything, you know that - in fact, when I was in <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson High School</span>, and Dr. Horowitz, who - they gave me a big party for my ig" birthday because I'd done this and that - so, he said he wanted the newspaper to write about the party, so he brings in people from the newspapers - the Jewish paper and the Post - the New York Post was in those days a different paper, liberal paper - so, this guy is interviewing me for the Post, and he says, "I understand you have a number.</sentence><sentence id="4500">Could you show me your number?"</sentence><sentence id="4501">So, I showed him the number, and he took a picture of my arm, and that's how the Post printed it - me and they wrote about the birthday party and how the whole class was throwing me a birthday party and that I was a victim.</sentence><sentence id="4502">So, when he said for me to show him the number, I thought, "Isn't that ridiculous."</sentence><sentence id="4503">But I didn't want to disappoint Dr. Horowitz, because it was in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he was doing the party.</sentence><sentence id="4504">I thought it was so ridiculous to start dwelling on those things.</sentence><sentence id="4505">I am just trying to show you by illustration how I felt.</sentence><sentence id="4506">I had no time for that.</sentence><sentence id="4507">That was a closed chapter.</sentence><sentence id="4508">Now, I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet, I didn't finish anything, I wanted to study, I wanted to do, I wanted to live, I wanted - I loved to dance.</sentence><sentence id="4509">Here I am going to go through the thing - ""d had enough of it!</sentence><sentence id="4510">And I really think a lot of people felt that way if they were yet young enough to more or less not to have the broken spirit because they had known already grown-up life, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4511">So, I just burst right into life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4512">In fact, I already had a great time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4513">But when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, that was absolutely everything, because I mean, I could now do all of these things, including going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and having a great time and marrying and having 4 wonderful children and all this.</sentence><sentence id="4514">Of course, now, because I have translated a lot of works on the Holocaust, I discovered - I have been discovering constantly new phases of the war that I was totally unaware of, because I didn't even want to dwell on it So, now, all these years later, 50 years later, I am first finding out about, okay, I knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span>, I wrote - I translated a book on this.</sentence><sentence id="4515">So, I knew about this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I did this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where there is true translation or true people I know.</sentence><sentence id="4516">But there is a whole world of Holocaust experiences that I never even knew about, which I am finding out about now.</sentence><sentence id="4517">But in those days, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, why would I want to bother with that?</sentence><sentence id="4518">Who had the time for that?</sentence><sentence id="4519">I didn't have time.</sentence><sentence id="4520">I didn't have time for anything, only for forging ahead.</sentence><sentence id="4521">And that, I think, carried me through life, in the sense that, if I look back, of course, I always, always think of my parents and the loss of my parents and the loss of my family, the tremendous loss of the family.</sentence><sentence id="4522">But to regret the life that was?</sentence><sentence id="4523">I cannot, because, if I went back now, that life would be nothing like the wonderful life that I had in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4524">So, you cannot go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, and I don't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, because I've been to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> twice, and believe me, that would be the last place I would want to live in, under the Communist regime, especially, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4525">So that, to sum it all up, I was lucky enough to be young enough to survive the war as a youngster, and to still be able - even though at the beginning, I did feel a little imbalanced, you know, my head was a little bit further away - higher - not higher - more progressive - my head progressed a little better than my other emotional, but eventually, it evened out, you see?</sentence><sentence id="4526">And of course, I sort of apply the experiences to my life as it's lived from day to day.</sentence><sentence id="4527">For example, everyone said, "How much do your kids know about your background?"</sentence><sentence id="4528">My kids always knew everything they wanted to know.</sentence><sentence id="4529">They knew I went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and I told them all the time, "Please ask me.</sentence><sentence id="4530">I will never set you down and say, "Sit down and I want to tell you this.""</sentence><sentence id="4531">I never did that.</sentence><sentence id="4532">That was never - I said, "But if you want to know, anything you want to know, I will tell you."</sentence><sentence id="4533">And every now and then I would relay an anecdote, and of course, they saw the films, and we're very close - our family generally, you know, our family - the Lermans and the Wilsons and the kids and the grandkids - we're very, very close.</sentence><sentence id="4534">So you know, the stories are exchanged, but not as an imposition.</sentence><sentence id="4535">I would never think of saying, "You've got to hear my story."</sentence><sentence id="4536">I myself wasn't interested in my story when the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="4537">I just wanted to say, "Okay, that's another chapter, case closed, keep on going."</sentence><sentence id="4538">So, that was my attitude and still is.</sentence><sentence id="4539">And, as you noticed, I am very short on specifics.</sentence><sentence id="4540">For example, my sister Anna, she knows a lot of specifics about the hierarchy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and who was what and how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were run.</sentence><sentence id="4541">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4542">I just know the particulars pertaining to my personal survival.</sentence><sentence id="4543">And the fact that, when the war ended, everything was fresh in my mind, but I wasn't interested.</sentence><sentence id="4544">I wasn't interested in me, period.</sentence><sentence id="4545">I was interested in the new life, and the me could wait.</sentence><sentence id="4546">And of course, it waited until now, when every day I am finding out about another thing that I never knew about.</sentence><sentence id="4547">So, the other day I read in the Polish press about Dietwagner (ph), this Polish community not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4548">Now, 60 years later, I am first, first finding out.</sentence><sentence id="4549">Now I read avidly, whether it's in Polish or in English, on the subject.</sentence><sentence id="4550">But in those years, it wasn't taboo.</sentence><sentence
