<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, my father decided at that time that his son has to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> if he cannot get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my father was one of those Germans who believed because he served the German Army in World War I, that they would not touch him since he was decorated and in the beginning they did make exceptions but later on it was all the same.</sentence><sentence id="14">When he decided it wouldn't, it would be the same like everybody else, he wanted to get me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so he sent me, they put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where I was picked up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> by a Jewish refugee organization which placed me with a Dutch family.</sentence><sentence id="15">And when I lived with this Dutch Jewish family, uh, I was of course sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I was told that I could not have the name Helmwood in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> it was too German and the Germans were still hated from World War I so they gave me the name Eddie and I, the name I kept since today, until today.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: I am going to ask about the Dutch family, but first I would like to ask about the taking leave of your parents.</sentence><sentence id="20">Do you remember saying goodbye to them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="23">A: Yes, I remember saying goodbye to them.</sentence><sentence id="24">When the papers came that I could, was allowed to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the police, my father, uh, uh, had almost what I felt, we felt was a heart attack, but it wasn't - he was just over excited and uh he almost passed out and it was quite a thing for him and for my mother of course too to get me out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to know me on the safe uh side, and uh, it was, it was for me as a boy, it wasn't as shocking as, because I was too young, it was almost like going, being sent to an uncle or aunt in a faraway <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but uh, I, the only thing I was worried about was leaving my parents behind.</sentence><sentence id="25">Because I knew at that time already what this was all about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Did they give you anything to take with you ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: No, I think the uh, uh, the uh, uh, laws at that time were you couldn't take any shoes, extras, I could take my clothing along.</sentence><sentence id="32">No, I, I do have a kidoscop, a silver kidoscop, that I took along and that was about all.</sentence><sentence id="33">It was wrapped up in uh my clothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Do you still have that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I still have that.</sentence><sentence id="46">And it was saved by non-Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: You mentioned your father had been in the German Army I understand</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51">A Yes.</sentence><sentence id="52">Uh, which, uh, when Hitler came to power in 1933, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted to rearm, of course, and, uh, the military, uh, were, uh, in vogue again and uniforms and uh medals were being worn because Hitler wanted a new army, a big army, and as a result, by Field Marshall Von Hindenberg, which was the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Hitler was the Chancellor, of course, they created the Iron, the Cross of Honor which was given, as I understand, to people like my, my father who had earned uh, the Iron Cross during World War I and who had served for four years on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">In other words, if he had served probably in the rear he probably wouldn't get it.</sentence><sentence id="54">But it was given uh to a lot of people just because Hitler wanted to make it popular again that the army is great and medals are great and so on and to uh.</sentence><sentence id="55">So, my father was uh, was given by the authorities a certificate with a medal which I still have to this day which was saved by a German Catholic family that he gave it to that had also served with my father in World War I.And uh the certificate uh I, reads basically uh - in the name of the Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor, which was Hitler, of course, given in my father's name, and uh, in uh, it gives the law that was passed to give this to people and I think it was a mistake to give it probably to the Jews but some of them slipped through.</sentence><sentence id="56">I don't know if everybody got it but I, I understand there are other people got it and uh, it says the Cross of Honor for <span class="DLF">front line</span> combatants, and the date on it is, the, the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglabach</span> (ph), is mentioned on there, the 7th December, 1934.</sentence><sentence id="57">And uh by order of the police president and uh, it is of course the swastika on it can be seen and the stamp that is on there and the city seal and the certificate 1, W 1 F.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Do you have the medal with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="68">A Yes, I do have the medal with me too.</sentence><sentence id="69">This is the Iron Cross and this is the Cross of Honor which were, which was worn even on the uniform and sometimes in a smaller, in a small version of it on civilian clothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: And how were you able to get these ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Well, my father had a, you cannot call it a wallet, but it is a leather folder and I happened to know the story of this.</sentence><sentence id="75">He kept his war pictures in here.</sentence><sentence id="76">And, uh, the pictures, uh and some other pictures were given, and plus these medals were stuck in, he had given to this family and they gave it back to me.</sentence><sentence id="77">The leather wallet here, it is very heavy leather, and is, the story is that it was from a saddle, ah, ah, it was shot from underneath my father during the war uh, and, uh, the saddle was riddled by bullets so it couldn't be used anymore and he got a new saddle, and so from the old saddle, he locally he had a little wallet made to put his war pictures in here.</sentence><sentence id="78">And, uh, uh, and it says on there <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> 1915</sentence><sentence id="80">near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smorngorn</span>, so apparently that's where this happened, the incident, and that's all I know about that.</sentence><sentence id="81">Except that my father didn't get hurt at all.</sentence><sentence id="82">The horse was dead but, and the saddle was uh bullet ridden and uh but my father didn't get hurt.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: And between December "39 when you arrived and May "40 when war broke out, what was your daily routine?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: My daily routine was only going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to learn what languages and eventually I also had to go and see a rabbi to be bar mitzvah, which I never was, and uh because the war started in meantime.</sentence><sentence id="113">The family was not very religious but uh they did insist that I take lessons to be Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, an additional thing uh which I should not forget is that my parents about six months later also arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> but without papers.</sentence><sentence id="115">They had, they were able to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> with some guide because we were very near the <span class="DLF">border</span> my father knew a lot of people and some Christian friends helped him to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Did you meet up with you parents at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Yes, my parents came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in 19, uh 39, probably the middle of "39, and uh, they did not have any money had to leave everything behind, they just had to walk across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">And uh, they were in a refugee status in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and uh, they were furnished a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was not big enough for me to live with them, but it was agreed by them that I would remain with the Dutch family where I was very happy uh and it was a rather large family, and, but I was able to see my parents on weekends.</sentence><sentence id="124">And during the week too.</sentence><sentence id="125">And, uh, till of course the war came and that's another story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Let's talk about that.</sentence><sentence id="131">What do you remember, starting with ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was considered a political refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">Now political refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were not just Jews but they were communists, democrats, anybody who had fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="136">And when the war started, the Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested everybody that was German, men first, uh, mostly men, in some cases some women, but my mother and I did not get arrested because we were German.</sentence><sentence id="137">My father was arrested because he was a German and they knew that he was Jewish, but these were the laws and they arrested everybody that was</sentence><sentence id="139">German, and put them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> - not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span>, Gurs, Rivesaltes and there were several others.</sentence><sentence id="140">Now at the time my father was arrested, by the police of course, Belgium police, we only knew that all these men were being transported to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because the German advance came very fast and they had to put them somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="141">At that time we decided, my mother and I decided, or rather my mother decided, that we should go and look for my father.</sentence><sentence id="142">We knew <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, we had some names, but we weren't sure.</sentence><sentence id="143">So we tried to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> ahead of the German Army into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">At the <span class="DLF">border</span>, Belgian, at the Belgian- France, uh <span class="DLF">French border</span>, uh we were arrested for being Germans.</sentence><sentence id="145">They looked at our ID cards, Belgian ID card, which were for foreigners, and it said of course nationality German.</sentence><sentence id="146">We were arrested by the police at the <span class="DLF">border</span>, trying to cross, and were put in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, my mother was put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's section</span>, and I, for the first time in my life, was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cell</span>, and that was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that date, of my life, because I was in solitary so to say, I was all by myself in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, for almost a week.</sentence><sentence id="148">And the Germans bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">I can't recall the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> right now but it was at the <span class="DLF">border</span>, it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vavik</span> (ph) was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vavik</span> (ph).And, uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's section</span> was served by nuns and I got to see my mother only once when she was being walked in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">After a week, or about a week, we were all assembled in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, all, more, more, I would think, there were mostly Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> under heavy guard and sent to <span class="REGION">southern France</span> to the , which is rather large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp which</span> later on became more famous because they put uh the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> (Ballon) (ph) in there and other people.</sentence><sentence id="151">It was originally a camp that was created by the French to put the remnants of the French, of the uh Spanish uh army who were fighting Franco in there when they fled to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they were put in there.</sentence><sentence id="152">But most of them they were gone by the time we came there.</sentence><sentence id="153">There were a few of them left who had not been resettled.</sentence><sentence id="154">And we were put in the , which in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>, in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, then the war was over pretty quick which we all know, and uh, where to go.</sentence><sentence id="156">There were releases everyday people got released.</sentence><sentence id="157">If you had papers to go to some <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span>, the French were glad to get rid of the people.</sentence><sentence id="158">The food was terrible there and people were, there were no killings, mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="159">If you didn't have any packages coming in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> there was a good chance you would die from hunger there.</sentence><sentence id="160">And there is a very large <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which I visited after the war, and uh, I assume that most people are buried there.</sentence><sentence id="161">There were no <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>, uh <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>, and uh, so, uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself was very, very bad.</sentence><sentence id="162">It was muddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh uh and it was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">makeshift camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">And uh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know it was the unoccupied zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and uh but the Germans did have some control because Germans did come there with the French, the Vichy police, or Vichy government officials, uh and uh, made sure that uh certain people are kept in there, but by that I mean probably German communists who were so-called enemies of the German state.</sentence><sentence id="164">Now when it came to the women and children, like my mother and myself, uh they say can you go anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="165">And we decided we would look for my father and it was also at that time determined that my father as in the which is on the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">I failed to mention that the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is toward the <span class="REGION">Atlantic coast</span>, one in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrennnes</span> and one is the Bas-Pyrennes of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, so we said we had</sentence><sentence id="168">a <span class="NPIP">destination</span> finally; we said we wanted to join my father.</sentence><sentence id="169">We didn't know whether or not he was going to be released but he was there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What <span class="NPIP">year</span> is this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="212">A Iam talking about 1940, late.</sentence><sentence id="213">Uh, we traveled to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we found my father, and uh, through again some help of the French, but at the time we were all speaking French pretty well, uh, we uh, went to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auchtafa</span> (ph) in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>, near in, uh very close to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pier-pinon</span> (ph) which is the place and the people were very helpful, the French in this particular, very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh who were uh had a lot of vineyards and that was their business mostly up there.</sentence><sentence id="214">And the French priest who was in a nearby <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this little <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and he made his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> available to some Jewish refugees and there were about three families living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">So my mother and I got refuge there, then we went to visit my father and there were visiting hours I think twice a week.</sentence><sentence id="216">We went to see my father and, uh, this went on for a couple of weeks or months, and uh, during one of the visits, we didn't go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp -</span> there was sort of <span class="DLF">visiting enclosure</span> with barbed wire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or so, and during one of the visits when the visit was over, and they said all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in charge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told me where, that I wasn't going to leave, and uh, I say well I came in, uh, I am already resettled.</sentence><sentence id="217">All he said I am not considered a child anymore, I am a man.</sentence><sentence id="218">I was fourteen at the time, and uh, I was kept in, just like that.</sentence><sentence id="219">They say you stay with your father here, you're you're not a child, you're a man.</sentence><sentence id="220">So all of a sudden my status changed, I was not able to go back and stay with my father.</sentence><sentence id="221">Uh - I was, uh, among a group of men, I was the youngest one among a group of mostly German Jews or also some, one German communist I remember and one German nobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, was fleeing from the Nazis and got caught there.</sentence><sentence id="222">And he was later delivered, uh turned over too to the Nazis when they came .</sentence><sentence id="223">Well, anyway, he, uh I was in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in and then a year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the rumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed labor.</sentence><sentence id="224">Uh, in part some of the people were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">This was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, this, this was just, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span> was just an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span>, there was no work being done there, it was uh on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span>, on a <span class="DLF">sandy beach</span> actually on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mediterranean</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">And uh, but people, people were being continually shipped out in groups and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> throughout <span class="REGION">southern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">Well, then the word came that's not completely true, some people are also being shipped out to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">At that time we were very well aware of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and concentration contrary to what some people think that some people say well we didn't know there were such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, I already knew it as a child before I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, because people used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you will go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and on the Kristallnacht, and that is a story I missed by the way, uh, when Jews were arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, uh, my father left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to look after his father and was not arrested, and it was just a coincidence and uh, his brother was arrested and his, uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration</sentence><sentence id="230"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">Well, uh the uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> my father went to was about twenty miles from where we lived and his father lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> all by himself but his younger, my father's younger brother lived with him, and he was married to a non-Jew.</sentence><sentence id="232">And uh which is also an interesting story but I am getting off the subject there a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="233">She was offered to get a divorce from him because her brothers were in the Nazi party.</sentence><sentence id="234">And she refused.</sentence><sentence id="235">She say, she said will stay with him in the bad days, she will stay with him in the good days.</sentence><sentence id="236">And, but he was still living there, but his wife had taken refuge someplace when he was arrested and when my father came to his father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in , which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), excuse me, they were demolishing the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">And there were Nazi storm troopers up there.</sentence><sentence id="238">As my father walked in and see what was going on, the storm troopers were from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> apparently, not from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there was a common thing that they brought in people from <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, there there were no - but the Chief of Police was present, a small police force, and it so happened that the Chief of Police had been sitting in uh <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> with my father.</sentence><sentence id="239">And he recognized my father right away.</sentence><sentence id="240">He said, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doing here?</sentence><sentence id="241">Was I looking after my father.</sentence><sentence id="242">He said, uh, well you're not supposed to be here.</sentence><sentence id="243">But he said nobody told me and uh so he took him to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">He said I can't do but arrest you.</sentence><sentence id="245">I have to uh, anybody who shows up has to be arrested, so I have to take you <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to your status.</sentence><sentence id="246">BREAK police chiefs and let him see his brother in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> who was later on transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too, my father always wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era, because he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else, he did his duty for his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and so on and so.</sentence><sentence id="247">Uh, and he said, well he said we have to do something for you.</sentence><sentence id="248">I, I don't see where a front-line combatant should should be in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> the guy said.</sentence><sentence id="249">So he called the local police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> and they ordered that my father be sent back, but they didn't specify that he be sent back under escort or without escort, so this policeman took it on his own to send, to put my father on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and say when you get back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, you report to the police.</sentence><sentence id="250">He didn't send another policeman with him.</sentence><sentence id="251">My father never did.</sentence><sentence id="252">And therefore escaped arrest and was not arrested during Kristallnacht or the day after.</sentence></p></dialogue>

No way, and uh to continue the story about that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp, -</span>, when these rumors I started talking about came that people are transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> maybe to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, uh, my father felt we had to get out and the fact that uh we both spoke French pretty well there were occasionally French gendarmes -

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="421">A: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="422">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were packed with people.</sentence><sentence id="423">There was very little food, what people had on them, and the only thing that I can remember that were given during the trip, on the trip towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, which I didn't know at the time but I found out later, uh, was water.</sentence><sentence id="424">We were guarded by uh Germans and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we stopped- they had to get also food, we were given some water and uh, were able to empty buckets we used as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="425">But there was hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for everyone to lie down.</sentence><sentence id="426">Some people had</sentence><sentence id="428">to sit up all night, people were packed in like sardines, several people died, some people committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="429">In my particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, a lady doctor gave birth to her own baby.</sentence><sentence id="430">And the child of course didn't survive; I don't know if she did.</sentence><sentence id="431">Uh.</sentence><sentence id="432">There was a most unusual event in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="433">Uh, being from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, my father was able to read through the cracks of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> some of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> names that we went through, so we definitely knew that we were going to upper <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salezia</span>, which is now <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>, what used to be the German city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>, and where most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that we found out after the war were located, including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and a lot of the <span class="DLF">subcamps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">Uh, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were opened at <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> every once in a while and people were beaten up mercilessly and outside of that, people were starving.</sentence><sentence id="435">Uh, people didn't have any food, didn't bring anything along.</sentence><sentence id="436">Some people stuffed their pockets full of something and they ate it, but I don't remember ever having been given any food except that we were given water and in some cases people weren't even given water.</sentence><sentence id="437">So that a lot of people arrived dead or starved or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="438">Uh, on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and again, I didn't know the destination at that time, at one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in, uh, I can't recall the name right now, in upper Salezia, a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were opened, and they said all men out.</sentence><sentence id="439">That was the order.</sentence><sentence id="440">All men, working men that were able to work, out.</sentence><sentence id="441">Uh, like I said, this was not arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but it was just a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and uh, at that time I had to make a decision.</sentence><sentence id="442">In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was pretty strong because I had worked that summer in the French vineyards to make some money.</sentence><sentence id="443">And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but uh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men.</sentence><sentence id="444">I wanted to stay with my father.</sentence><sentence id="445">And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it meant.</sentence><sentence id="446">Work meant able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="447">To live.</sentence><sentence id="448">And, but we didn't know what it meant for my mother and from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> number 31, according to the, this book from the French government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors.</sentence><sentence id="449">They determined after the war.</sentence><sentence id="450">So all the women and children went straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the German Red Cross, or International Red Cross, at and they had a listing saying that all the women and children went straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">So I assume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which was sometimes in September 1942.</sentence><sentence id="453">Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my lucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you can survive.</sentence><sentence id="454">And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put to work in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="455">But I didn't know the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> would be at the other end.</sentence><sentence id="456">Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother until after the war, and I searched for my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span>, and various other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but I didn't find her, until I was determined that she actually did perish.</sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, my father and I were sent from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in those days these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">subcamps</span> were called , which means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span> of the Chief of 0 some of the other people who tried to prove they were better than the Germans and didn't like the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="458">I'm not saying that the Germans or the Nazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the horrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were.</sentence><sentence id="459">They called, so-called people who lived in the <span class="REGION">territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="460">They were sometimes Polish, sometimes German, in upper Salezia, and at that time they had opted to be German and some of the people didn't speak German that well.</sentence><sentence id="461">Their Polish was a lot better.</sentence><sentence id="462">And uh, the uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good.</sentence><sentence id="463">Of course, the initial experience was the roughest experience under the circumstances.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="511">Q: Why don't you talk about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we were in two smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, I don't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="514">I think in one <span class="NPIP">case</span> it was six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand.</sentence><sentence id="515">One was the camp of Lazy -L-A-Z- Y, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the sites where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span> had been bombed by the Russians I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="517">In those days I don't think the Americans were coming out that far.</sentence><sentence id="518">And they bombed two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, whatever, and also building new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span>, which was the hardest work because people were not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death on the job or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">And the system was at that time whenever they needed more labor, new people were coming and being fed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">Supposed they had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on the job.</sentence><sentence id="521">Well, they got a hundred more from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or wherever they got them from to be sent in to fill up the <span class="DLF">void</span>.</sentence><sentence id="522">And uh, so we were also digging up unexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> career, uh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far away in case something exploded.</sentence><sentence id="523">And some people did get killed that way.</sentence><sentence id="524">Uh, but, uh, railroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people were not strong enough to lift up the <span class="DLF">rails</span>, and uh, some people got crushed under the rails, and people fell down.</sentence><sentence id="525">Our clothing was uh, uh, limited.</sentence><sentence id="526">In the wintertime we had clogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="527">In the beginning we had our own with the Star of David on it.</sentence><sentence id="528">Later on we got the blue/white-striped uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="529">Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper food, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases.</sentence><sentence id="530">And a lot of people committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="531">This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, is not people being killed but people committing suicide.</sentence><sentence id="532">Particularly in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I am coming to later on which was the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">Uh, but nobody thought they were going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="534">Uh, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, uh, was like I said most <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and then later on we were sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I don't know if the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was done away with, but the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was transferred.</sentence><sentence id="535">We went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh, when we worked on construction of <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> for the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume was producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any non-military projects.</sentence><sentence id="536">They were all always in support of the military.</sentence><sentence id="537">So we worked near the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory.</sentence><sentence id="538">Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky</sentence><sentence id="540">1 that I was able to speak German.</sentence><sentence id="541">I had an advantage over the other Jews who were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh, Yiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red, uh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="542">And if you're able to speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able on the job to execute an order right away.</sentence><sentence id="543">You understand the order was given immediately.</sentence><sentence id="544">And that was very important.</sentence><sentence id="545">Some people picked it up pretty fast.</sentence><sentence id="546">Some of the other people, if they came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the Jews from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, and in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we were all Jews which changed later on through mix.</sentence><sentence id="547">Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got less beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we had to work in teams uh loading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> (ph) and we were two people or four people as a team and all of them spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="548">We tried to team up that way or working that way because it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in German.</sentence><sentence id="549">And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I forgot.</sentence><sentence id="550">I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian.</sentence><sentence id="551">My father was very great disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped, and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="552">It wasn't like our kids are today.</sentence><sentence id="553">And, but it helped me later on, being able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and understanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way.</sentence><sentence id="554">Uh, which I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war, it is true in many cases.</sentence><sentence id="555">If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped.</sentence><sentence id="556">And in some case, uh, uh, when we were building <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> you had to read the diagram, how to, into uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired up a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh, with uh the wire, the smaller wire, and if you're able to read the diagram from German, your job was much easier.</sentence><sentence id="557">You didn't make any mistakes.</sentence><sentence id="558">And so on, so that helped.</sentence><sentence id="559">Anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh although I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew and I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but Dutch and Flemish is almost the same.</sentence><sentence id="560">And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he picked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law was also in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="561">So we teamed up.</sentence><sentence id="562">We were about the same height, and the same age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a group of Dutch Jews that arrived at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and it is a sad experience to tell about the Dutch Jews.</sentence><sentence id="563">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of butter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies.</sentence><sentence id="564">All of a sudden no food at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short, the shortest period of time, there were very few left.</sentence><sentence id="565">I don't, I think we did receive one time a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to maybe fifty or less.</sentence><sentence id="566">I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="567">Because uh, it was much harder on them, whereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life, where lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he was able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time.</sentence><sentence id="568">In the end it was all the same.</sentence><sentence id="569">But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the West and a</sentence><sentence id="571">2 Jew from the East - the survival rate.</sentence><sentence id="572">Uh, a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was toughened up, or a Russian Jew or whoever they had from the, the <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="573">So in that respect I think, uh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western European Jews.</sentence><sentence id="574">But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style that they had before.</sentence><sentence id="575">So I teamed up with this boy.</sentence><sentence id="576">At the time probably more so than his family, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and I must tell this story because Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends.</sentence><sentence id="577">As a matter of fact we're like brothers.</sentence><sentence id="578">And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water shower.</sentence><sentence id="579">The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch Jews and they were lined up in the <span class="DLF">camp street</span>, and they had said that they did not perform their job properly.</sentence><sentence id="580">They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews.</sentence><sentence id="581">And they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work and hosed them down - they call it hosing down.</sentence><sentence id="582">By that they took a fire hose in the middle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the people the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death.</sentence><sentence id="583">This is, this is a winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now.</sentence><sentence id="584">A eastern European winter, with snow on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, leaving people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> all night and by morning most of them were frozen to death.</sentence><sentence id="585">And that was the end of Mike Swab's father and brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="586">So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of course still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German quite well, because first of all Dutch and German is very close and he picked it up very fast; he knew some before.</sentence><sentence id="587">Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family was wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="588">This is another story for after the war.</sentence><sentence id="589">But uh, we could not have been closer because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to survive and our main idea was to be able to escape.</sentence><sentence id="590">And I said here I have somebody who's, maybe my father won't be able to make it.</sentence><sentence id="591">I knew at that time he was getting weaker but he was pretty good at that time.</sentence><sentence id="592">So I said if we're going to make it, the young people are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could almost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together.</sentence><sentence id="593">We talked about it and then said we just have to help each other the best way we can.</sentence><sentence id="594">If you find some food, you share it with me.</sentence><sentence id="595">I find some extra food, I share it with you and it has to be complete honesty and none, none of this taking away from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="596">Many times it feels people come like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized.</sentence><sentence id="597">And we're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized.</sentence><sentence id="598">We're going to remain the way we came as much as possible and we're going to get out.</sentence><sentence id="599">Never to leave that idea behind that we're not going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="600">We are going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="601">And uh, that was the singlest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot of luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things.</sentence><sentence id="602">But I think that the, think the idea that uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive.</sentence><sentence id="603">Now, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we always stick together.</sentence><sentence id="604">His number, uh that was tattooed on his arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> but when we moved to the subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="605">And uh, we uh, the bond was even stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't have a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father.</sentence><sentence id="606">Although my</sentence><sentence id="608">3 father did work in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but at nighttime we saw each other in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="609">And we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I had to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh, uh, on a, a <span class="DLF">construction site</span>, on a <span class="DLF">railroad site</span>, you had what these guys they call mister ,or , which is a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke German, he left a piece of bread or something.</sentence><sentence id="610">And then I would take it back and share it with my friend Mike and my father or something.</sentence><sentence id="611">But there was a little help every once in a while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at times.</sentence><sentence id="612">And uh, when we were transferred to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, with Mike Swab, of course, we teamed up, uh, filling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> (ph), and they have a name for that, auch 5 which I don't know if there is a name in English, means in working, you fill your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> and then if the others are finished, you can rest up.</sentence><sentence id="613">In other words, you don't have to fill another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> (ph) because there are two people to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="614">You throw the dirt in, and then some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and you unload it, and you fill <span class="DLF">holes</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="615">Or bunk craters or whatever we did there (mumbled).</sentence><sentence id="616">And uh, uh Mike and I were probably among the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was ciga - one cigarette a day.</sentence><sentence id="617">These were Russian mahorka (ph) cigarettes which had been either captured or gotten from the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>; they weren't real tobacco, but to the smoker this was better than nothing.</sentence><sentence id="618">And there were people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who would give their bread away instead of (mumble) rather not eat than smoke a cigarette.</sentence><sentence id="619">And that's how we traded.</sentence><sentence id="620">There was a trade going on among the people who were smokers and who rather would die smoking, not from cancer but from not eating, and would give a piece of their bread away just to have a .... TAPE ENDS ... that they, because they were's always the same, whether he was a uh, uh, a bad or good, shouldn't say good guy because there weren't many good guys, most of them were bad, but occasionally there was one who probably had regrets having joined the SS or, and we had one who actually spoke Yiddish, who apparently had lived with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="621">Some people suspected him maybe partly Jewish, but we never determined that and he disappeared later on.</sentence><sentence id="622">Maybe he was found out, but uh he did speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="623">And uh, uh, it was also question of survival who your guard was that particular day.</sentence><sentence id="624">So if you were lucky maybe for many weeks you had the right guard.</sentence><sentence id="625">Somebody came along he just hated you for being able to speak German as well as he did.</sentence><sentence id="626">Or maybe better.</sentence><sentence id="627">If he was a guard who came from some <span class="REGION">territory</span> which are the uh, uh - I can't think of name right now - ethnic Germans, who were transported back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, came from the Sudanan (ph) land.</sentence><sentence id="628">And some of these people did not speak so well German, so here you have a guard whose German was not so good, but a prisoner, a Jew, spoke better German than he did.</sentence><sentence id="629">And that was of course cause for taking it out on somebody, and, and that was very frequent, very frequent.</sentence><sentence id="630">But it didn't have to be the language, there were many other things this happened to.</sentence><sentence id="631">Pause.</sentence><sentence id="632">Uh, in the uh, digging up of bombs, uh, we were all so lucky.</sentence><sentence id="633">I'm speaking very frequently about luck because uh, the survival is part the luck, staying healthy and a, a number of other things.</sentence><sentence id="634">But the luck part was that in my team, this again I'm talking about teams (mumbled) in someplace you were work as team, a team of five people there were digging up bombs.</sentence><sentence id="635">We had an form (ph) engineer, a Jew who knew how to defuse bombs, who learned it apparently in there, and in other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teams</span> which just had to be somebody in the team of five people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the bomb and some of them went off.</sentence><sentence id="636">So our case in a team that dug up the bombs, we had an</sentence><sentence id="638">4 engineer that knew what he was doing and we never had an explosion.</sentence><sentence id="639">So again, luck.</sentence><sentence id="640">And uh, uh, what can, else can I contribute to, faith.</sentence><sentence id="641">Yes, I'll speak about that now.</sentence><sentence id="642">Uh, I came from a Jewish family which went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on holidays, and on Sabbath evening, but not orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="643">We had a <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the only one, and it was a city of about 800 Jews I believe.</sentence><sentence id="644">Middle class mostly, and uh, uh, I'm getting off the subject.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: MUMBLED -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="786">Things I think of I want to say, not about faith, but uh about how I met my wife later on.</sentence><sentence id="787">Uh, I married a, I married a non-Jewish woman, a German, but she comes from a non*Nazi family.</sentence><sentence id="788">I, I, her uncle was the uh, president of the German Jewish Friendship Society, he was a former German professor, and he was the Senator for Cultural (ph) Education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">Uh and, uh, so I, I knew this when I met her, and wanted to marry somebody as a friend of my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's son, who married a woman who comes from a big Nazi family, and the family didn't even want to have anything to do with them.</sentence><sentence id="790">But uh, uh, my wife wanted to become Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="791">I said for you believe whatever you want to believe.</sentence><sentence id="792">That's the way I do.</sentence><sentence id="793">I'm not sure I believe everything that the Jew does - I believe what I want - that's the way I came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">And, uh, but my wife said but my children are educated as Jews, but according to the law, they are not Jewish and I know that because their mother has to be Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="795">And to me this means absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="796">My children feel as Jews, they're educated, they go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, some of them, not all.</sentence><sentence id="797">Like all the other Jewish kids too.</sentence><sentence id="798">But uh, they went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Sunday School</span> for ten years, every one of them.</sentence><sentence id="799">They are always the top ones in their class, and so I have, don't have a problem with it.</sentence><sentence id="800">To me, conversion means nothing.</sentence><sentence id="801">I have seen so many people being converted by militant chap __ that didn't deserve to be converted.</sentence><sentence id="802">Just because, for the in-laws, or ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: You were talking before about how your faith helped you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="825">We're not on yet.</sentence><sentence id="826">We are on.</sentence><sentence id="827">Oh, I didn't know that, I didn't realize that.</sentence><sentence id="828">O.K.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="829">Anyway, I started talking about my faith.</sentence><sentence id="830">Now, I mentioned that I, uh, we belonged to <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> which was the only one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="831">And we had an outstanding rabbi there.</sentence><sentence id="832">Was quite impressive man.</sentence><sentence id="833">And so I had a good Jewish education.</sentence><sentence id="834">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, you also get lessons of religion, and so the Jews are, just like here you may have to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you don't do it in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, you go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to your <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to get religious lessons.</sentence><sentence id="835">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, it's part of the curriculum that once or twice or three times a week you have an hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="836">And so uh, I grew up, to make a long story short, to be with a solid Jewish education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not, neither was my father, very religious.</sentence><sentence id="837">My grandparents were, on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">And uh, so, my faith, that I want to talk about, I lost towards the end of the war, my faith in God.</sentence><sentence id="839">I say how can there be a God, and I was not thinking about myself, or this was even before my father was killed.</sentence><sentence id="840">Uh, I lost my faith because I say how can God allow that little children and women be killed.</sentence><sentence id="841">And uh, I kept this for about a year after the war.</sentence><sentence id="842">And then I felt I came back not because somebody tried to convince me there is a god, all by myself I said</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="846">5 there has to be something superior, but I will never call him almighty again, because if he was almighty, he could have prevented that.</sentence><sentence id="847">So I don't believe that God is almighty.</sentence><sentence id="848">I do believe in architect of the <span class="NPIP">universe</span>, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="849">But, uh, and my children believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="850">Uh, and I, these questions I have talked extensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever they want to.</sentence><sentence id="851">They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out before, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between me and my wife before we got married.</sentence><sentence id="852">I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="853">Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when we have children, what they will be.</sentence><sentence id="854">So, I said whatever you want them to be is alright with me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way.</sentence><sentence id="855">So I decided the children would be Jewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only.</sentence><sentence id="856">In the memory of my parents, because my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children are going to be Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="857">If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why they're one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="858">So my wife fully agreed.</sentence><sentence id="859">And my wife, after several years, wanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="860">You'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing.</sentence><sentence id="861">And as far as the children, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all there is to know, and they can do whatever they want.</sentence><sentence id="862">And, uh, I give them that freedom, because I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came back to me after the war.</sentence><sentence id="863">Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I was in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="864">And, about faith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he had experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had experienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could still believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="865">And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="866">Anyway, that's, I mentioned religion.</sentence><sentence id="867">Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion, one or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your fellow man.</sentence><sentence id="868">To me, I look at my parents as being godly.</sentence><sentence id="869">They were good people, they died, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them.</sentence><sentence id="870">And I can see God in other <span class="NPIP">people</span>, live people.</sentence><sentence id="871">They are good people.</sentence><sentence id="872">I see God in <span class="NPIP">nature</span>.</sentence><sentence id="873">So I can consider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years, I didn't believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="874">This was one year after the war.</sentence><sentence id="875">Uh, the belief to survive I talked about.</sentence><sentence id="876">O.K., one was religion or the belief in God.</sentence><sentence id="877">One was luck.</sentence><sentence id="878">Health was of utmost importance.</sentence><sentence id="879">Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="880">Because there were so many diseases.</sentence><sentence id="881">There was typhus in <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="882">Diarrhe</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="883">A: The worst enemy that I, that I have seen.</sentence><sentence id="884">Once you had it, you couldn't get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="885">And, fortunately, in some of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and I am getting back to the story later on more extensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine.</sentence><sentence id="886">There was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even without, with little food.</sentence><sentence id="887">For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was burned and ground it up and ate the ashes, uh, the coal actually.</sentence><sentence id="888">The coal, and that is one thing that will help you in preventing diarrhea, or if you have diarrhea maybe you can get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="889">So from coal.</sentence><sentence id="890">So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even chewing on a piece of wood.</sentence><sentence id="891">Just to kill the feeling of hunger.</sentence><sentence id="892">So, and, and, and like I</sentence><sentence id="894">6 said the doctors were very helpful in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, even though they weren't allowed to practice, with that advice.</sentence><sentence id="895">And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able to survive that you were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="896">Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped later on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five pounds.</sentence><sentence id="897">I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy.</sentence><sentence id="898">And that was my luck.</sentence><sentence id="899">Uh, just skin and bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American pounds.</sentence><sentence id="900">And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same.</sentence><sentence id="901">And we picked it up, about fifty pounds in six months, in three months.</sentence><sentence id="902">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="903">But uh, from the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I was talking about, we went to a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was called Blechhammer (ph) and this was an actual small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of about four thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="904">When I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I must make the difference between a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and this was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had something like I believe maybe a hundred subcamps, some smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="906">And these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">subcamps</span> were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to death.</sentence><sentence id="907">That was the point in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="908">They were used for the German war effort in most cases.</sentence><sentence id="909">In this particular case, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.361925" long="18.277396">Blechhammer</span> (ph) was a camp that was about I think maybe a hundred kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, maybe less, I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="910">And it had the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and everyday we went to work in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="911">Now, the, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">gasoline factory</span> was being bombed once by American long-range bombers.</sentence><sentence id="912">And I must as a <span class="DLF">side-line</span> state something.</sentence><sentence id="913">I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers about the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that it couldn't be done.</sentence><sentence id="914">It was too far.</sentence><sentence id="915">Well, we were just, I would say within fifty miles of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="916">And we were being bombed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span>, which was something happy event for us although some prisoners got killed, and in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, where we did also mostly construction work.</sentence><sentence id="917">We didn't actually participate in the operation of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="918">These were Germans or other foreigners.</sentence><sentence id="919">And they had also British prisoner of war camp nearby.</sentence><sentence id="920">Uh, the uh, uh, we were mainly used to clean up from the bombings.</sentence><sentence id="921">We built and built new <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> where the Germans could hide.</sentence><sentence id="922">Now when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> came overhead, there were several bombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings.</sentence><sentence id="923">That means releasing, a hundred <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> releasing all the bombs at one time for effect.</sentence><sentence id="924">And they tried to destroy the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war.</sentence><sentence id="925">Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, like I said, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="926">The people, and I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to talk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> there because that was done at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="927">And we were there for one purpose, to work.</sentence><sentence id="928">We worked to death.</sentence><sentence id="929">The food was so so but compared to the previous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> it was a little better because they really needed us very badly there.</sentence><sentence id="930">But there was uh, one meal in the morning and one meal at night.</sentence><sentence id="931">And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at the place of work.</sentence><sentence id="932">And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day.</sentence><sentence id="933">And the facilities for hygiene were very poor.</sentence><sentence id="934">I didn't touch on that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and the common latrines and the people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one from one another.</sentence><sentence id="935">The water was someplace on, the cold water.</sentence><sentence id="936">And anyway, the Blechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept camps because the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in</sentence><sentence id="938">7 charge.</sentence><sentence id="939">One of the prisoners was not a copple (ph) which was so bad, but he was also was a winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by the SS.</sentence><sentence id="940">And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph) was his name.</sentence><sentence id="941">And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but the, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="942">Uh, we were not bothered too much while we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="943">We had to work.</sentence><sentence id="944">Uh, people were sometimes beaten to death.</sentence><sentence id="945">It was up to the local SS who guarded us.</sentence><sentence id="946">Or even to some of the German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew that it doesn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="947">You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick.</sentence><sentence id="948">Now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.361925" long="18.277396">Blechhammer</span>, it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way.</sentence><sentence id="949">Ifa hundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of time, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> immediately, which wasn't very far away.</sentence><sentence id="950">So they could work people to death and then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or not or whether they were taken care of locally.</sentence><sentence id="951">I really don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="952">But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a couple hundred more.</sentence><sentence id="953">And this was true also in the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">Uh, exactly the same method of replenishment.</sentence><sentence id="955">Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know exactly but uh, November or so of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="956">My father became very weak.</sentence><sentence id="957">Uh, was also like a skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50.</sentence><sentence id="958">He was going to have, and uh, at that time there was unwritten rule, and I've checked it out after the war, this, there was someplace there was something in writing, and someplace there was nothing, I don't know the sit was__, but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker, non- Jewish, who worked in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good enough for the war effort of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="959">Therefore, he was disposed of.</sentence><sentence id="960">Disposal meant <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> if they have one.</sentence><sentence id="961">In our case <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was nearby.</sentence><sentence id="962">So what they did ever once in a while, they picked up the people.</sentence><sentence id="963">Some people said I can't, I'm weak.</sentence><sentence id="964">Well the SS picked them out or they picked out older people.</sentence><sentence id="965">But there was always a group of people that was sent back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.361925" long="18.277396">Blechhammer</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="966">But whoever reached the age of was automatically put in that group, to be disposed of.</sentence><sentence id="967">Well, what they said just for fun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard.</sentence><sentence id="968">They needed to rest.</sentence><sentence id="969">But what it really meant and we knew that not officially but the rumors were they was being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="970">And that is exactly what happened to my father.</sentence><sentence id="971">I came back from <span class="BUILDING">work</span> one day.</sentence><sentence id="972">My father wasn't there and didn't come back, and I was, where is my father, trying to find out frantically.</sentence><sentence id="973">Well, he was ina special <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, a <span class="DLF">barbed wire enclosure</span> with one <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they assembled those people.</sentence><sentence id="974">They referred to it as the <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> but it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> - it was just a gob of people and sent them away in a couple of days or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="975">Well, I saw my father one more time through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and it was nothing I could do and nothing he could do.</sentence><sentence id="976">And I could only hope for the best, not wanting to be true it is the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> at the other end, but it was.</sentence><sentence id="977">And so I know the exact fate of my father.</sentence><sentence id="978">Uh, he was taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.361925" long="18.277396">Blechhammer</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and gassed and disposed of.</sentence><sentence id="979">And, which also happened to be the fate of my father, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already.</sentence><sentence id="980">And uh, so when I was alone, I still had by friend Mike Swab, which was something great to have, to have uh somebody to lean on and he can lean on you.</sentence><sentence id="981">And we decided from then more than ever that the first chance we get we're going to escape.</sentence><sentence id="982">And we worked together, but</sentence><sentence id="984">8 it was almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="985">The, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> had very high <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">They were made from concrete slabs, and on top of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was electrically loaded barbed wire.</sentence><sentence id="987">There was no way to get out.</sentence><sentence id="988">And it was well controlled with <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="989">And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no way to escape either.</sentence><sentence id="990">There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">The only place where it would have been possible to escape was at the <span class="DLF">work site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="992">If you worked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="993">But when I worked in a separate group, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group.</sentence><sentence id="994">And our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, plan was that if we can escape it should be in a group.</sentence><sentence id="995">Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is found out, but some of us might get through.</sentence><sentence id="996">So it always better in a group, then split up once you're <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="997">O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what do you do when you escape.</sentence><sentence id="998">You're in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or some <span class="NPIP">place</span> or <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="999">My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by the name of Sonnon (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), whose parents were friends of my parents, to get to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then to survive the war in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1000">And I am sure they would have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Joasenchat</span> (ph) in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="1001">And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me.</sentence><sentence id="1002">Either that or we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1003">But he wasn't sure where he would go to in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1004">I was sure where I would go to in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so we decided it would be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1005">But then the question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn.</sentence><sentence id="1006">In other words, you looked like a prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1007">And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could throw away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and looking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go.</sentence><sentence id="1008">So even if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of work, in, in the <span class="BUILDING">synthetic gasoline factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1009">There were many chances.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And some people did escape, but they were all caught.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And when they were caught, they were brought back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and hung whether they were dead or not dead.</sentence><sentence id="1012">They were hung or put on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> for all the prisoners to see.</sentence><sentence id="1013">Here's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Some of them were shot and the bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before uh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it.</sentence><sentence id="1015">They were left out all day, all night, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes.</sentence><sentence id="1016">And that was standard procedure - to bring them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and let all the prisoners see what happens to an escapee.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Well, uh, I have one other incident at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Uh, I got hit by machine gun fire.</sentence><sentence id="1019">There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war effort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but occassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the German war effort.</sentence><sentence id="1020">In other cases, where three people were hung at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span>; they were accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1021">But what they had done, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners had taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we didn't have any belts.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the wire and they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> being assembled.</sentence><sentence id="1023">In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an example, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution.</sentence><sentence id="1024">And one of our plans that Mike and I had was also which we had learned from other people, the thing to do to get</sentence><sentence id="1026">9 out of something, if there is not a planned execution where they just make sure everybody is dead, , to drop the moment they start firing, to drop down, and let a body fall over you.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And then be covered up.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And maybe be left for dead.</sentence><sentence id="1029">And that is exactly what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1030">But, uh in this particular case, the SS came, apparently they had no intention of maybe having a mass execution but just fire into some prisoners because somebody got angry, or was upset about something, not performing enough work that they, uh whatever the reason was which could be many reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1031">They just started firing.</sentence><sentence id="1032">The reason as far as I know was that we didn't perform at work.</sentence><sentence id="1033">And so I was hit.</sentence><sentence id="1034">Now, my luck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for that to go into that.</sentence><sentence id="1035">I got out of this alive by getting up later on, going back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and being treated by a prisoner doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1036">Now there was no place that I could go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1037">I was scrapped (ph) several times, three or four times on my head, and right here, and here, and the hair never grew back and there was a piece of bone missing, but luckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and although I did have puss in it I was healed by this doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1038">And uh with normal thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me up and, and like I said there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> I could go to.</sentence><sentence id="1039">Well, next day I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1040">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rest up or after loss of blood and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Uh, and I was asked since I was bloody and had a bandage around my head, not regular bandage but some old clothing, what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1042">And I said I got hit during the air raid.</sentence><sentence id="1043">And many prisoners were either killed or hurt pretty badly at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> during the air raids, the bombings of the <span class="BUILDING">synthetic gasoline factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1044">And then prisoners were walked back.</sentence><sentence id="1045">Some days they were lucky - they got some bandage from the local German workers.</sentence><sentence id="1046">From the SS we got nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1047">From the local German workers, which were also hit sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="1048">So, and when you walked down in the morning people would say, hey you, you fit to work.</sentence><sentence id="1049">You say yes, I'm fit to work.</sentence><sentence id="1050">I looked very strong even though you had lost some blood you would be really weak, but that was always the thing during the selection process that went through several times.</sentence><sentence id="1051">So even if you were, don't come walking up there like you weak, almost falling over, which was the case in most cases and in my case sometimes too but I never let anybody see that I was weak and just looked straight and strong when you went through <span class="DLF">selection line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1052">Well, when I walked out that morning, it wasn't a <span class="DLF">selection line</span>, it was just the guys going out, the guy pointed me out and I said I was hit during the bombardment and he passed me.</sentence><sentence id="1053">So that's how I was able to survive that.</sentence><sentence id="1054">Uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span> after my father, did exist and I don't have my exact dates.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Till December of 1944 when the Russians advanced.</sentence><sentence id="1056">At that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1057">We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns, artillery, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or whatever, bombings.</sentence><sentence id="1058">And the word we got and we were always a little bit in the dark since officially we got no word at all what was going in the outside world, but occassionally somebody would get a newspaper which was sometimes in some cases punishable by death, depending on how the SS felt.</sentence><sentence id="1059">You know, somebody could bring a paper back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had, but uh, we were able to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away and so we were sort of informed.</sentence><sentence id="1060">But that was the <span class="REGION">German side</span> that we were reading.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Uh, in this particular case, I uh, we heard the guns and the rumor came we going to be evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="1062">Uh, where to nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Away from the front.</sentence><sentence id="1065">That wasn't to do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1066">And they had to get it from somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1067">And I think, I'm not sure, that</sentence><sentence id="1069">0 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was already captured at that time or not.</sentence><sentence id="1070">I have no knowledge of that.</sentence><sentence id="1071">But they were getting close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> too, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I don't think made any death marches.</sentence><sentence id="1072">People were just left in there or killed or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1073">But in this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> that we were in, or subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we were evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="1074">This was the plan I assume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night time put in a <span class="DLF">field</span> with lights away from the front towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1075">And we finally arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1076">When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days, we went for days without food.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Water we got once in a while.</sentence><sentence id="1078">And I assume, I don't have any specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four thousand prisoners that were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1079">Some people remained behind, and there were other people in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that I read up after the war, that came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1080">They had to put them somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1081">People who had been marched into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> when we were out already.</sentence><sentence id="1082">They didn't know what do to with them, the Russians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures.</sentence><sentence id="1083">It was very confusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blesheimer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen which was another large, larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And in the group that I was in, we were standing in mud being counted, and I was standing in the front row being able to understand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior.</sentence><sentence id="1086">He was delivering 276 prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1087">Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four thousand.</sentence><sentence id="1088">I don't know how many got there.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I don't know how many were killed every day.</sentence><sentence id="1090">But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE.....barnes from farmers.</sentence><sentence id="1091">Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred prisoners to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1092">They would lock them up in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1093">This was for proper control so nobody could run away during the night.</sentence><sentence id="1094">If they had you out in the <span class="DLF">open</span>, that meant they have lights on and they couldn't go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1095">But if they could lock you up in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, they just have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1096">And the prisoners were locked up.</sentence><sentence id="1097">Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning before mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can, I can, but they were just dragging themselves on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1098">They would shoot them by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">They would just pile them up and fire into the group.</sentence><sentence id="1100">The regular mass executions.</sentence><sentence id="1101">They make sure nobody is left behind.</sentence><sentence id="1102">They even went so far to make it easy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked cemeteries to execute people, next to cemeteries.</sentence><sentence id="1103">Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1104">I don't know why but it is very odd.</sentence><sentence id="1105">But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span>, next to <span class="BUILDING">cemeteries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1106">Uh, so from <span class="BUILDING">Gross Rosen</span>, the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at <span class="BUILDING">Gross Rosen</span>, were transported in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1107">This was a few days later.</sentence><sentence id="1108"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> was of course well inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was on the <span class="REGION">western front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Here we're coming from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> to the <span class="REGION">western front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1110">And we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, we didn't arrive, we arrived near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>, which is rather large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, on the <span class="DLF">track</span> leading through the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> to the other side of, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And uh we were very unfortunate.</sentence><sentence id="1112">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> must have been spotted by <span class="DLF">air</span>, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, and I don't know whether they were British or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American airplanes</span>, uh, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was bombed.</sentence><sentence id="1113">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stationary at that time, the engine was stopped.</sentence><sentence id="1114">But it was just outside the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> before getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, and when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was bombed, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was hit</sentence><sentence id="1116">1 and split open.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Some people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1118">But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably covered by others, and we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and this was near some <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Now, we knew we were hungry, we were starved because we hadn't gotten any food from the time we left Gross Rosen in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Uh, we went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it was the nearest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1121">It was near the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and helped ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1122">The inhabitants of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, because the bombing was still going on.</sentence><sentence id="1123">And the clear wasn't given.</sentence><sentence id="1124">The moment the all clear was given we had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parkas</span> full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing ourselves, or loading up with food.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And many prisoners did that.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Those that were caught were shot by the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1127">We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going into <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span> and grabbing food.</sentence><sentence id="1128">But again there was no way to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1129">At that time it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Where to go?</sentence><sentence id="1131">Hair shorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1132">No <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="1133">No.</sentence><sentence id="1134">And it was so easy to escape at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this bombing but the rest of us finally arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">Being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, we thought this was going to be the end now.</sentence><sentence id="1137">They're not going to take us anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1138">Apparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to the east.</sentence><sentence id="1139">The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection processes at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went through several selection processes.</sentence><sentence id="1141">Some of them were more formal than others, and others were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind.</sentence><sentence id="1142">You were not strong enough anymore or you go.</sentence><sentence id="1143">But this was a regular selection process, where to we didn't know at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1144">Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span>, looking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak German?</sentence><sentence id="1145">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we were given shots at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1147">I am coming back to that in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="1148">What worried me long after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1149">Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization.</sentence><sentence id="1150">In many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people were sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other placces it was just for experimentation.</sentence><sentence id="1151">And I had thought that at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> before going to the next camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenstein-Zwieberge</span> (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized.</sentence><sentence id="1152">I didn't know what sterilization involved.</sentence><sentence id="1153">It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year after the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been sterilized.</sentence><sentence id="1154">But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I was safe on that point.</sentence><sentence id="1155">But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I could find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was prevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be, at least not have a disease that kills everyone in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1156">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> then we uh, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> we were transported to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenstein- Zwieberge</span> (ph) which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And it was hidden in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1158">But we didn't know at the time that it was a secret project of the SS where they were building <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1159">Their was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> (ph) which is a more famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the other end of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span> and we were at the lower end of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Harz Mountains</span>, building <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> to construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like we have seen in the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian Museum</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Uh, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V-2</span> was the secret weapon of Hitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the</sentence><sentence id="1162">2 bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1163">So they had picked the <span class="DLF">Harz Mountains</span> to construct a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> underneath.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Now at the end where we were, there was no <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1165">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was operating up north, but we were constructing the second project, and the job consisted of being marched from work everyday from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was also about four thousand people, and which was a very mixed camp.</sentence><sentence id="1166">The Jews were a minority in there.</sentence><sentence id="1167">The camp was practically led by communist prisoners, German communists, who had been there, the first ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="1168">Another group, there was a replenishment group and they were pretty well organized.</sentence><sentence id="1169">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">temporary camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1170">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had existed, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1171">Uh, the march to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> was very tedious every day, and almost no food.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And again the replenishment method was five hundred people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1173">Uh, each time five hundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1174">There was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>, I was detailed to that for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And today there are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount of prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to replenish.</sentence><sentence id="1176">So then all of them in <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1177">There is a site - I never went back there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to come back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the <span class="REGION">western world</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And uh so the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is still in existence, a national monument, and young soldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="1179">But it is one of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that existed.</sentence><sentence id="1180">So the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> are there.</sentence><sentence id="1181">They have a very nice <span class="NPIP">site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1182">They send me pictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the story is not complete.</sentence><sentence id="1183">It is probably worse than if you actually read this.</sentence><sentence id="1184">It is not the same thing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1185">You cannot picture this.</sentence><sentence id="1186">You cannot picture going hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Sometimes | think if you tell someone what hungry is like.</sentence><sentence id="1188">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenstein</span>, the work was the killing method of people.</sentence><sentence id="1189">By that I mean working in <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> without the proper protection.</sentence><sentence id="1190">You had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> out or carry them out.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And then the blasting.</sentence><sentence id="1192">They never had the prisoners far enough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they would carry the rocks off.</sentence><sentence id="1193">So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough away so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be safe from the blasting, so many people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1194">And those people had to be carried back at night and put into the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1195">You know, thrown in.</sentence><sentence id="1196">And I also must mention one horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="1197">At the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leichenstein</span>, they buried many people who were alive.</sentence><sentence id="1198">People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get up, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a pile with the dead people and buried.</sentence><sentence id="1199">At one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown in, a few live people were still moving.</sentence><sentence id="1200">He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw earth on him and the man was shot at the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1201">That happened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leichenstein</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And uh, there are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I existed in, and was the least known <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because it was a secret project.</sentence><sentence id="1203">Now, when I mentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there was something known about it, something special about this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">It was like a lot of rumors were circulating all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1205">It was a common rumor which turned out to be true</sentence><sentence id="1207">3 after I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of, there wouldn't be no evacuation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in case the Americans come.</sentence><sentence id="1208">All prisoners have to be killed, no survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1209">Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1210">Now, uh, while we were working in the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, there were German engineers in there.</sentence><sentence id="1211">I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1212">Every once in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some of them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold.</sentence><sentence id="1213">First of all, it was freezing in there.</sentence><sentence id="1214">Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we started there.</sentence><sentence id="1215">And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring in that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he would.</sentence><sentence id="1216">And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1217">So he was one of the good guys.</sentence><sentence id="1218">And we were able to pick up this clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1219">He left it ina certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we picked it up.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm.</sentence><sentence id="1221">That too, but the main reason was to be able to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1222">We figured this is one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we will never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or February how long the war was going to last.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And we say if we did well so far, we are not going to do well here because no way.</sentence><sentence id="1224">And there was killing by working people to death.</sentence><sentence id="1225">That was all, and beating to death.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1586">Q: I just want to ask you......</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1588">A: Yes, this was one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where Mike was working in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but at night time we were together in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1589">Uh, the specific story that I can tell, there are really too many, but is how we were put in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, just lined up like sardines.</sentence><sentence id="1590">There was not enough <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, for everybody to stretch out.</sentence><sentence id="1591">There were no double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1592">It was just the plain <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> I was in.</sentence><sentence id="1593">But apparently the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was created for a lot less people and then there are four thousand people and maybe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was created for a thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="1594">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1595">I would say so.</sentence><sentence id="1596">But then the people just stretch out on all these <span class="INT_SPACE">barrack floors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1597">And uh, at night time when people would come back from work in the dark, there would be no light on.</sentence><sentence id="1598">People would fight and actually strangle each other, become like animals, just to get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1599">And we were attacked many times, but Mike and I, we always stood together and we defended ourselves, just for having a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1600">It was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1601">People were just like animals and there were people who went to the <span class="NPIP">pile up place</span> where there were bodies and thought they could cut out a piece of meat.</sentence><sentence id="1602">And they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="1603">And some would be severely punished for doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1604">These peoples were considered inhuman, but they were crazed from hunger, some of these people.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And particularly when somebody was left in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of a couple of days, too weak to go to work, and it would be the end after a few days anyway and people would die.</sentence><sentence id="1606">And like I said, they grabbed some of these people and buried them alive.</sentence><sentence id="1607">They didn't even pile them up anymore <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, just took them directly to the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And each <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leigenberg-Zwieberge</span> (ph) has five hundred people and I believe there were six of them.</sentence><sentence id="1609">Uh, now, the story in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, this is one of my most vivid memories of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, is that overhead, these were just one floor <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and we sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1610">There were rafters overhead holding the <span class="DLF">roof</span> together, and every morning as we got up there would be people hanging.</sentence><sentence id="1611">Every morning, in every <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1612">Because people knew they were not going to survive and any</sentence><sentence id="1614">4 day, and might as well die now instead of living a few more days, a few more weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1615">Well, lucky for Mike and me, we didn't feel that way.</sentence><sentence id="1616">We figure it's got to be the end.</sentence><sentence id="1617">We're going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1618">We have to.</sentence><sentence id="1619">And, uh, maybe they're going to evacuate us you know.</sentence><sentence id="1620">We also hear that the Allies are coming closer, but we were just .. And we teamed with four other guys at that time who also had the same ideas.</sentence><sentence id="1621">They were all about our age and they were all making it sort of, like we did, being able to stand up on their own two legs.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And we said, we shall escape together.</sentence><sentence id="1623">And they also had gotten civilian clothes like we did from some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> they were working, they were wearing underneath their blue/white stripped uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And, uh, so we said, well we'll try and escape and then we go in different directions, maybe two one way, two another way, maybe one SS guard is firing, maybe he'll hit some of us, maybe he won't hit anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1625">But some of us will get out.</sentence><sentence id="1626">But we always noticed that if one person would escape they would always hit him, by submachine gun fire.</sentence><sentence id="1627">Automatic fire.</sentence><sentence id="1628">So we had that in mind.</sentence><sentence id="1629">We always stuck together.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And said if it comes to an evacuation we won't be on a death march like the one from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> that we will never survive, because we know what happened there.</sentence><sentence id="1631">And we should escape then from the march because that would be towards the end anyway from .</sentence><sentence id="1632">Uh, coming back to the people that were hanging themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1633">It was our job every morning before going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for report period, people would be counted - how many are still alive, how many are still there - that we had to take those bodies down from the <span class="DLF">rafters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1634">And pile them outside the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and then another group would come and pick them up and take them to the <span class="DLF">mass graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1635">Uh, my, if I, for years, and I still do occasionally, there wasn't a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have a large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life.</sentence><sentence id="1636">I have had after the war, or soon after I get married it was more normal than ever.</sentence><sentence id="1637">Uh, for years, when I had <span class="NPIP">dreams</span> it was about escaping, escaping.</sentence><sentence id="1638">Because it was always on our minds, escaping.</sentence><sentence id="1639">Whenever I had a <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, even today when I am sometimes, probably tonight I'll have one, I will dream about escaping.</sentence><sentence id="1640">It was a standard thing.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And that is what kept me alive.</sentence><sentence id="1642">That's what kept Michael Schwab (ph) alive, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And, but the other dream that is more frequent than any dream about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, is about the people hanging themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1644">There is nothing more vivid in my mind than seeing those people taking their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="1645">It was bad enough, somebody else taking your life, or mass execution, but people just giving up, just plain giving up.</sentence><sentence id="1646">And I have had occasions, and I don't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> one day at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and my pants were very wet, and I hung up the pants in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, and the pants were just hanging there, and I got up during the night and that's nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1647">When I have a bad dream, and I walked into where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> is and I saw these pants hanging and immediately I thought somebody was hanging there.</sentence><sentence id="1648">And, uh, like suicides are, is one of the worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1649">Not just by <span class="DLF">rafters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1650">We had people, and my thoughts have been divided on that - whether it was a courageous act or a coward's act, I'm not judging people when they commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1651">I would never do it.</sentence><sentence id="1652">Uh, I would feel, I get through things.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And uh, although, given thought, yes, I must admit I've given it thought.</sentence><sentence id="1654">I think everyone who has been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> has given thought to suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1655">But uh, I have seen a man commit suicide why I thought it was a courageous act.</sentence><sentence id="1656">When he stood in front, when we were repairing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span>, and the <span class="DLF">second line</span> (ph) a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">speed train</span> came by and he just went in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he stood there facing it and he got run over by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1657">It killed</sentence><sentence id="1659">5 him.</sentence><sentence id="1660">And I, you know, there were many other ways.</sentence><sentence id="1661">We tried to prevent suicides, but that is a shameful thing in my opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1662">On my own part, the only thing I would help somebody that wants to die, let them die if they want to die.</sentence><sentence id="1663">That's an old man that I saw had cut his wrists, and I shouted because there was blood spurting from his wrists, and we made a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he was taken back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he was beated up savagely and he was killed that night for trying to deprive the German state of labor.</sentence><sentence id="1664">And that was the sentence on this guy.</sentence><sentence id="1665">You couldn't even commit suicide - that was against the law to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1666">And that man would have been much better off dying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where I found him, at work.</sentence><sentence id="1667">And uh, so, from then on my idea was about suicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it.</sentence><sentence id="1668">Now, if it would have been somebody close to me it would have been a different story.</sentence><sentence id="1669">Like if my friend Mike Schwab would have done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it.</sentence><sentence id="1670">But I knew that he, that just a momentary thing, it is not something he believes in.</sentence><sentence id="1671">I think a lot of people think about it for a long time before they do it.</sentence><sentence id="1672">Or they do it on short notice.</sentence><sentence id="1673">They say all of a sudden, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1674">Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lagenstein</span> was probably the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the worst memories I have.</sentence><sentence id="1675">Everything goes into the background when I think about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langenstein</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this was also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or they just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings.</sentence><sentence id="1677">Officially, not just being hit, but being laid over what they called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bok</span> (ph), which is like a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> for beatings, and they would lash you.</sentence><sentence id="1678">Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to get out of some work, and we got special beating.</sentence><sentence id="1679">But we were strong and we were able to survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by other prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but my guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1680">And so the prisoner didn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating.</sentence><sentence id="1682">It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got fifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time.</sentence><sentence id="1683">There was nothing to treat him with.</sentence><sentence id="1684">So this was common <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1685">Not only at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langenstein</span> but in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="1686">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lagenstein</span> was the worst.</sentence><sentence id="1687">So I am coming to the next and the last story I think.</sentence><sentence id="1688">My escape.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: I just want to come back to the story of your escape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: O.K. We knew the Allies were approaching.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And in this case the American Army.</sentence><sentence id="1853">That was more or less known.</sentence><sentence id="1854">Uh, some people overheard the SS - they were talking the Americans are coming.</sentence><sentence id="1855">O.K. What's the next thing.</sentence><sentence id="1856">The order was to evacuate the prisoners, but noboby knew where.</sentence><sentence id="1857">So Mike and I made up our mind, the other four guys, we're going to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1858">The first march that we make, the first night or the second or third or whenever we can, we're not going to last for fourteen days.</sentence><sentence id="1859">But, as they transported us, we went out in groups of five hundred people, and the SS did that for a purpose.</sentence><sentence id="1860">I didn't know that at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1861">We thought it was for better control.</sentence><sentence id="1862">Instead of having a large group of four thousand prisoners, or three thousand five hundred together in one group, if there is a mass escape, they cannot kill everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1863">So they took groups of five hundred people each.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And we thought that was for better control.</sentence><sentence id="1865">Have the guards around, and some of them with dogs.</sentence><sentence id="1866">I think each group had about one or two police dogs, German Shepherds, and they were pretty vicious.</sentence><sentence id="1867">And I didn't even tell any story about the dogs.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Cough.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Uh, when we were marched out in groups of five hundred, we thought it was for control purpose and the order was to march prisoners at night so the population wouldn't see us, and to sleep them and rest during the day, because the SS had to rest to.</sentence><sentence id="1870">But we walked out and we were walking towards the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, and then we were redirected.</sentence><sentence id="1871">Now this I found later.</sentence><sentence id="1872">I didn't know all this at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1873">Because from the publication that the East Germans sent me, what actually happened.</sentence><sentence id="1874">The order, and this I found out after the war, I didn't know this at the time, the order was to take the groups of prisoners, in group of five hundred, in different <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and dynamite the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and bury the prisoners alive in there, so there would be no survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1875">Because the order was no survivors from that particular secret project.</sentence><sentence id="1876">If they shoot them, yes, they could have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1877">But easier to drive them to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, which was just a few miles away, and dynamite the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> alive.</sentence><sentence id="1878">But as it turned out, they were in radio contact with their former observers, or troops, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1879">Uh, there was American tank column cited coming around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And they were looking for the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1881">They knew there was something secret</sentence><sentence id="1883">7 going on because they are trying to find the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span> one time because we were there and there was air alarm, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">torpedo plane</span> and tried to put a torpedo into the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1884">It was not successful.</sentence><sentence id="1885">It was all camouflaged.</sentence><sentence id="1886">Uh, they redirected us because they thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tank column</span> was going to cut us off before they get to the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1887">So we marched back.</sentence><sentence id="1888">We marched to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and then we marched, to make a long story short, we marched three nights till we actually escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1889">And what happened, every night, they parked us, let us rest in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, just like in the first march.</sentence><sentence id="1890">During the day, they took, they requisitioned a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> from a farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1891">Since we were only five hundred people and they could put five hundred people in almost any <span class="BUILDING">barns</span>, squeeze them in if it's a small <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and then, bring us out at night.</sentence><sentence id="1892">Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had some potatoes and food for the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Even for five hundred because he's feeding cows and other animals.</sentence><sentence id="1894">So in the first and second night we got some food from the farmer, it was the only thing, and water.</sentence><sentence id="1895">In the night time, they put the prisoners, of course, into these <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and they posted guards <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1896">The next morning, march again.</sentence><sentence id="1897">Whoever couldn't march was shot by the SS - the same system like the other.</sentence><sentence id="1898">So, again, we were prepared at that time - we were wearing our civilian clothes underneath and we said we've got to go the first chance we get.</sentence><sentence id="1899">So on the third night, we had just, we had decided if we had crossed several small <span class="DLF">bridges</span> or small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span> or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>, we have to get across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because, we could all swim, we knew that.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And we had decided after crossing a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> would be the most opportune moment to escape and then go towards, or swim across because a dog would pursue you on <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1901">But a dog would not swim across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> unless he is trained to do so.</sentence><sentence id="1902">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>" dogs I don't think were trained to go into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1903">They were trained to pursue prisoners on <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1904">So we decided that ours, and then he would not, he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> but they can smell across <span class="REGION">land</span>, so they can follow you.</sentence><sentence id="1905">If they turn the dog loose.</sentence><sentence id="1906">Well what happened then, on the third night we had just come across a small <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1907">We didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1908">We were getting away from the <span class="REGION">American front</span>, that's all we knew.</sentence><sentence id="1909">Where to nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="1910">And I don't think, the SS were just trying to get us away because they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention among them whether to kill or not to kill the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1911">And I think one case I heard that a SS tried to make contact with the prisoners, that he was a good guy, that they should say so in case the Americans come.</sentence><sentence id="1912">So maybe some of them were O.K. and some of them were not, and some were just scared and maybe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop transports</span> on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and they were particularly following <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And that's where all the transportation.</sentence><sentence id="1914">As we came across a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were walking in ranks of four, with the SS on the side on a small <span class="DLF">country road</span>, a body seen from the <span class="DLF">air</span>, and by that I mean at night time, signled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> who would be the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">observation plane</span> ... TAPE ENDS . ..</sentence><sentence id="1915">and prisoners escaped and this happened and they got shot.</sentence><sentence id="1916">When <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were not around, they put the searchlights on and sent the dog after them, or they would shoot the prisoner and they couldn't run so fast, you know, and __.So there were several, there were, a matter of fact, quite a few escapes but everyone of them would get caught, so we thought that the time to escape was near a small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> if we were lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhead, just above where we were going to go.</sentence><sentence id="1917">So we were lying down and we knew that were going to be no searchlight on and we took off.</sentence><sentence id="1918">All six of us said go, and we went.</sentence><sentence id="1919">And we must have been just a couple of hundred yards away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and one dog that decided the last moment's enough for us.</sentence><sentence id="1920">I got</sentence><sentence id="1922">8 bitten by the dog in my leg, and I didn't even feel it.</sentence><sentence id="1923">I didn't even know I was bitten.</sentence><sentence id="1924">I thought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went after the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but only Mike and I made it.</sentence><sentence id="1925">The others went in different directions, like I said.</sentence><sentence id="1926">That was our plan, to go in different directions and some of us get through.</sentence><sentence id="1927">Either some of these people are killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later on after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1928">They knew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1929">So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them.</sentence><sentence id="1930">But Mike and I got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and we swam across, and then we were safe from the SS, from the dog, and the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk.</sentence><sentence id="1931">They maybe come with a local police dog and sniff us out.</sentence><sentence id="1932">And we didn't smell so good and uh, we were full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the white lice were just running around on the suit.</sentence><sentence id="1933">And anybody would have recognized somebody coming from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">But anyway, the first thing we did we went to some, there were some <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> nearby, and like I said it was at night and I don't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three in the morning and people would be asleep.</sentence><sentence id="1935">So we decided we have to get off the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, off the <span class="REGION">land</span> where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it is safe, but not out in the open.</sentence><sentence id="1936">So we got to a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and we found a <span class="DLF">window</span> next to the, where the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="1937">Underneath the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> there is, this was a solid build, brick stable.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And underneath the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and this was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> for the foods for the animals, and also the <span class="INT_SPACE">potatoe cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1939">They store hugh amount of potatoes in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and we decided to get in through the <span class="DLF">cellar hole</span> which was from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, not going through the front.</sentence><sentence id="1940">When we lifted it up, I let myself down.</sentence><sentence id="1941">We didn't know what we would hit in the dark, whether it would be some water or something.</sentence><sentence id="1942">We were scared.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And Michael was holding on to my arms, and I said there must be something below me.</sentence><sentence id="1944">It smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know.</sentence><sentence id="1945">And I guess right, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1946">I figured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below my feet I hit potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1947">But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop or whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on.</sentence><sentence id="1948">So anyway, Michael came in and then we dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might open up the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">potatoe cellar</span>, we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping or something.</sentence><sentence id="1949">So we dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there was enough <span class="DLF">air</span> to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day where we were and what we could do.</sentence><sentence id="1950">So we got out the next day when everything was quiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of course were not found.</sentence><sentence id="1951">And then we went into, we got some milk to drink.</sentence><sentence id="1952">We went into the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1953">We found some milk.</sentence><sentence id="1954">I think it was put there for the cats.</sentence><sentence id="1955">They had a lot of cats.</sentence><sentence id="1956">We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took and filled out pocket up with potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1957">We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were worried about diarrhea, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1958">Anything raw.</sentence><sentence id="1959">But we got our first real food, and then we went our way.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span>, but get away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the artillery fire that was coming closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="1961">We didn't know which <span class="NPIP">direction</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1962">We didn't know which uh way should we get away.</sentence><sentence id="1963">Where we would go?</sentence><sentence id="1964">Would be another</sentence><sentence id="1966">9 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in front of us or not.</sentence><sentence id="1967">But we wanted to get away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, uh, because that's where most people were and we would be recognized possibly.</sentence><sentence id="1968">Uh, what we did then is sleep in bushes during the day near some <span class="DLF">field</span> or someplace and then march at night toward the sound of fire.</sentence><sentence id="1969">And that took us seven days.</sentence><sentence id="1970">And there is another little story but I think it is so long, un incidents along the way, but anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1971">We came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2100">Q: We have plenty of time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

no more <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2142">But I cannot let you go.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2143">So I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do.</sentence><sentence id="2144">I said, kill him?</sentence><sentence id="2145">You know, we had a little sign.</sentence><sentence id="2146">But we couldn't say anything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2147">We could just look at each other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see this guy wasn't really all there.</sentence><sentence id="2148">He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2152">0 say an old man.</sentence><sentence id="2153">He was my age or older.</sentence><sentence id="2154">And, uh, so I said well, let's try it.</sentence><sentence id="2155">Maybe we're lucky.</sentence><sentence id="2156">And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the open anyway.</sentence><sentence id="2157">If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2158">So he took us to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2159">The <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job for the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning papers.</sentence><sentence id="2160">We came in there and he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> burning papers.</sentence><sentence id="2161">And he said in German, or course, we couldn't understand everything, he said I pick up some Dutch workers here.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2162">When he said that I felt pretty secure you know.</sentence><sentence id="2163">And he said they lost there papers in a bombing raid.</sentence><sentence id="2164">Uh, can we give them some papers?</sentence><sentence id="2165">Ah, he said, 5 what's the use, the war is finished.</sentence><sentence id="2166">He said who cares about papers the mayor said you know.</sentence><sentence id="2167">And he didn't want to have anything to do with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2168">And he looked at us and he said to us, and the guy, the policeman went in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to make a phone call or to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2169">I didn't know what he was doing, but he left for a second.</sentence><sentence id="2170">He said to us, the mayor, we have some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> escapees in here, so we are being careful you know.</sentence><sentence id="2171">He looked at us like he knew we were.</sentence><sentence id="2172">And we figured he's not going to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2173">So we said, well, the policeman came back in, and he said, get rid of them.</sentence><sentence id="2174">I don't want to have anything to do with them.</sentence><sentence id="2175">And he said, well, I said, we have to get some, and then we started getting frantic (ph), and said give us some paper please.</sentence><sentence id="2176">I said that you know we lost our papers in a <span class="BUILDING">bombing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2177">Well I said, I can't give you any paper.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2178">There is nothing you can prove, nothing I can prove.</sentence><sentence id="2179">So anyway, there was a big discussion and finally said, well, we're not going to insist because this guy might change his mind.</sentence><sentence id="2180">And so he, the mayor said to the policeman, why don't you take them and get them out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2181">Well, he got us out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2182">By the time we got to the next <span class="BUILDING">guest house</span>, <span class="BUILDING">beer house</span>, he smelled beer again, and he said well, you go this way and then you go to next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2183">Maybe they will give you some paper.</sentence><sentence id="2184">And he went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">beer hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2185">And we were free.</sentence><sentence id="2186">I said, Michael, I said, we got out of something that could have turned out bad.</sentence><sentence id="2187">The only thing it would have made us is killers.</sentence><sentence id="2188">We trying to save our lives and it would have gone wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2189">So we were lucky again.</sentence><sentence id="2190">And somehow it was always a sense that we're going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="2191">I mean the sense never left us, Michael and myself.</sentence><sentence id="2192">And then, somehow, through luck or through our own thinking, or, or doing things the right way and uh, mostly luck, that we're going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="2193">The one thing that never left me is the sense that if anybody's going to make it, I'm going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="2194">And never give up hope.</sentence><sentence id="2195">And Michael was the same way.</sentence><sentence id="2196">And O.K. Now our actual liberation.</sentence><sentence id="2197">So we went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2198">And we noticed that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> when we got <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, on the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> that some people had next to their <span class="DLF">farms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2199">We said we cannot be out in the open <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2200">There wasn't that much other vegetation there.</sentence><sentence id="2201">Let's get close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there are some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> or something and sit down or lay down and go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2202">The Americans got to be here anytime.</sentence><sentence id="2203">So, we laid out there, and in the night we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling.</sentence><sentence id="2204">And then we heard German voices, and we didn't know this, when we got there, they had placed that same evening what they called faukstorma (ph), which is the German national guard if you call it.</sentence><sentence id="2205">They are old guys and young fellows.</sentence><sentence id="2206">Last minute they put them into uniform and make soldiers out of them.</sentence><sentence id="2207">And they had placed these guys with ponce so founst (ph) in little <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the ground to be a defense against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2208">And ponce so foust (ph) is a, I'm not sure what, we call it a anti-tank weapon.</sentence><sentence id="2209">It's a shoulder held weapon that one man can fire.</sentence><sentence id="2210">It's not a gun and they can sit in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and usually one loads the gun and one fires the gun.</sentence><sentence id="2211">And there</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2215">1 was one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we would hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> coming across the <span class="DLF">field</span>, go towards the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, put our arms up.</sentence><sentence id="2216">But we figure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2217">And we didn't want to get shot by the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> either you know, by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="2218">So as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were coming across in the morning, it must have been about five o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that time - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we decided we're going to move on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> towards them.</sentence><sentence id="2219">Well, somebody noticed something moving in that one <span class="DLF">hole</span>, and they had in the meantime had <span class="DLF">holes</span> on the right, probably on both sides of where we were __.</sentence><sentence id="2220">But we were far enough away not to be seen, maybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from each <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2221">I don't know, but we must have been right in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="2222">And uh, one guy called over in German, what is that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> (ph) - is this a patrol, because they didn't know from their own people that - they just thought it was a German army patrol.</sentence><sentence id="2223">And I said to the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut, shut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know.</sentence><sentence id="2224">And he probably was believing that we were German patrols since he could only see us crawling.</sentence><sentence id="2225">And then it takes the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, one company of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> for seventeen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, all of a sudden came across the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2226">And as soon as we saw the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> coming we put up our hands and we were just hoping that they wouldn't start firing, because prisoners get shot sometimes too, even if you give up.</sentence><sentence id="2227">Well, the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, the guy jumped down, and he spoke German, he was a German-American that they used as an interpreter, and he made all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> stop and he brought the officers up, the commanding officer, and they radioed back to the battalion that they had some guys who were escaped prisoners, and to make a long story short, they used us.</sentence><sentence id="2228">In other words, we knew what was in front of them.</sentence><sentence id="2229">Which was the right thing to do and we were glad to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2230">And they said you're prisoners, you look like prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2231">can you prove it?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2232">We showed the number on the arm and apparently some of them knew already.</sentence><sentence id="2233">They had crossed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, another one someplace.</sentence><sentence id="2234">This was the Third Armored Division, D Company of the 32nd Armored Regiment of the Third Armored Division.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2235">One of Patton's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">divisions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2236">And uh, so we had a small conference there, and they if we say any German army units, or they were particularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns, and I said all we know the German ponce de foust (ph), the anti-tank weapon, and they are all old or young guys as far as we can determine from their voices but we don't know for sure.</sentence><sentence id="2237">We just crawled through.</sentence><sentence id="2238">So they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> with the P.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2239">A: system and the guy in this German said there are no German army troops around, there are only the army helpers, the national guard or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young guys and old people - that it would be silly to fire one shot because the moment the first shot is fired, they are going to destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2240">And they hoisted white flags and they gave up and there was not one shot fired.</sentence><sentence id="2241">And uh, so, then, it came to us, and we were taken back to <span class="BUILDING">battalion headquarters</span> where the battalion surgeon examined us right away.</sentence><sentence id="2242">We were then put on scales and uh, it was a small, like a small, not <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, a batallion aid station.</sentence><sentence id="2243">And they had all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">medical equipment</span> to take care of, and that was basically our liberation.</sentence><sentence id="2244">And then the regimental commander came looking at us, congratulating us and then the company commander said if they want to stay with us, the boys they can stay with us.</sentence><sentence id="2245">Then when they went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, they requisitioned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the two of us, and told the women to make a hot bath for us.</sentence><sentence id="2246">That we were going to be bathed by</sentence><sentence id="2248">2 medics, and cleaned up completely, because they have to go on, and we can't go with lice with them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2249">That we have to be , and they came with Lysol and whatever you have as a disinfectant, and we were completely taken care of medically.</sentence><sentence id="2250">And examined by a medical doctor or military doctor and found to be healthy, not have any communicable diseases.</sentence><sentence id="2251">But it actually wasn't exact the first day, we went through a couple of days of check-ups.</sentence><sentence id="2252">But in the meantime, we were then, the first thing to do was get rid of the lice.</sentence><sentence id="2253">And that we did.</sentence><sentence id="2254">And our hair shorn off again for last time.</sentence><sentence id="2255">And uh, then, we stayed, to make a long story short, we stayed with D Company of this tank battalion for six months.</sentence><sentence id="2256">The war was over in another few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2257">And they were taken out of combat immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2258">After that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, that was their last combat session.</sentence><sentence id="2259">And we stayed with them, and with an O.K. by the higher ups, that we can stay as long as we want to until we find our families, "til we are certain we are finding anybody family.</sentence><sentence id="2260">In the meantime, we are changed from these old prisoner garments to GI uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="2261">We were just like soldiers without rank of course and we were treated in the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> like kings, and we had access to the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span>, not during dinner hours but anytime we wanted to walk in eat.</sentence><sentence id="2262">We picked up 50 pounds in three months.</sentence><sentence id="2263">Which was really a dangerous thing to do because I heard a lot of prisoners overate, and we did too, and killed themselves overeating.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And that basically is the story.</sentence><sentence id="2265">And uh, so, then to finish up, after our escape, my first thought was to find the family, but I didn't know where to start.</sentence><sentence id="2266">And first we had to get back on track, get normal again.</sentence><sentence id="2267">So Michael and I stayed and like I said for six months.</sentence><sentence id="2268">And then we were taken back, they were moved back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schofenborg</span> (ph) which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, into their regular <span class="REGION">area</span> where they were going to settle down.</sentence><sentence id="2269">This little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Viny Koomstad</span> (ph) near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And this company was then settled down and we settled down with them.</sentence><sentence id="2271">We given a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> they requisitioned.</sentence><sentence id="2272">So the first thing, we still didn't have any papers, the question of papers, what to do about papers.</sentence><sentence id="2273">So they inquired with the police and say, they have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2274">When we heard <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, just the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, no way we're going to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2275">We didn't know at the time about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2276">To us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> was another, a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2277">You know, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2278">But it wasn't true of course.</sentence><sentence id="2279">But we just heard the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we said no.</sentence><sentence id="2280">And uh, the batallion commander said the boys don't have to go to any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> if they don't want to.</sentence><sentence id="2281">They just go to get papers.</sentence><sentence id="2282">So they commander officer sent an officer with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2283">This was right in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> where there was a compound where all the Jewish refugees moved in.</sentence><sentence id="2284">Ah, not just Jewish refugees, there were other refugees, but they were mostly Jews that had been liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or were picked up in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, forced laborers from other <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2285">They were in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> and there was a guard at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> but you could walk in and out once you had your papers.</sentence><sentence id="2286">But people were taken care of medically and furnished papers after they were identified.</sentence><sentence id="2287">So he took us in there and the uh, official said they have to stay here, they can't go back with you because they don't have any papers.</sentence><sentence id="2288">It will take maybe, take weeks before we get any confirmation on them.</sentence><sentence id="2289">And we have such a overload here anyway, and the lieutenant looked at us, and he said, well, what you decide boys.</sentence><sentence id="2290">And the thing was up to us, not to this guy, official there.</sentence><sentence id="2291">And I said we're not staying.</sentence><sentence id="2292"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Papers</span> or no papers, we're not going to stay in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2293">And we stay with you.</sentence><sentence id="2294">So he took us back and then there was an agreement reached that we can stay until we get papers, until we also, even after we get papers, we can stay with them while we decide where our families are, go back to, Michael to</sentence><sentence id="2296">3 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and my case go both to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2297">Because either <span class="NPIP">place</span> our family could have been.</sentence><sentence id="2298">But we had decided in the case of my immediate family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2299">My parents that we would meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2300">Or meet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span> (ph) with a Catholic family that we know.</sentence><sentence id="2301">So I went to both <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Didn't find of course anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2303">And I did find some distant cousins and I did make some contact with the Joint Distribution Committee, which was of course a Jewish organization.</sentence><sentence id="2304">And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, and then the thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost 19.</sentence><sentence id="2305">No, by the time I came back I was 19 already.</sentence><sentence id="2306">Uh, they said that I am too old for an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2307">But the man that ran the Joint Distribution Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had been one of my father's friends in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> in the French camps of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Cyprien</span>, and he said, well, 18 is the limit for <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>, but you're past limit, but we'll let you have a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in here, and you find a job.</sentence><sentence id="2308">We'll put you through <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2309">We'll do something for you.</sentence><sentence id="2310">So I got a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> there and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and tried to learn a trade at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="2311">And Michael went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="2312">He wasn't as lucky as I was.</sentence><sentence id="2313">He didn't find, well I didn't find anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2314">He didn't find anyone from his family.</sentence><sentence id="2315">Everybody was killed.</sentence><sentence id="2316">And uh, he didn't have the offer to go into an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or anything up there.</sentence><sentence id="2317">So he went back to the Third Armored Division.</sentence><sentence id="2318">They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use official transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2319">We were fully covered.</sentence><sentence id="2320">So Michael took advantage of that and uh, make his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish soldier, to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2321">And he stayed with him until he actually left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2322">I remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and I also came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but I came in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="2323">I came by asking for visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I had to wait until December "47 to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2324">I did get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2325">And the draft was still going on here.</sentence><sentence id="2326">I was going to be drafted.</sentence><sentence id="2327">In Europe, if you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of course, but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> didn't have an army, but other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, they were still drafting too after the war for a while.</sentence><sentence id="2328">I would have been subject to the draft.</sentence><sentence id="2329">Well, it would have been a bad thing after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> of course.</sentence><sentence id="2330">You know, you want to lead a regular life.</sentence><sentence id="2331">But here the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had nothing to do with me, that my past was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2332">I would have been subject to the draft.</sentence><sentence id="2333">So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they had at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career.</sentence><sentence id="2334">What I was after getting an education from the military.</sentence><sentence id="2335">I did exactly that.</sentence><sentence id="2336">I came in as an enlisted man, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able to go to Officer's Candidate School and became an officer and make the Army a career for twenty years.</sentence><sentence id="2337">And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation and I was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="2338">And then I joined the civil service after my military career.</sentence><sentence id="2339">And I was another twenty years in the civil service.</sentence><sentence id="2340">But I probably missed the story that is very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife.</sentence><sentence id="2341">And I married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in remembrance of my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2342">And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I wanted them to have something.</sentence><sentence id="2343">Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a</sentence><sentence id="2345">4 belief, believe in something.</sentence><sentence id="2346">And the closest thing to me was being Jewish, and closer than that, that my parents had to die because they were Jews, the sole reason, because they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2347">And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here.</sentence><sentence id="2348">Uh, about two months ago, I made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And I visited my, the old folks are not alive anymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who by the way were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lasenstadt</span> (ph), the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also perished, including an 80 year old grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="2350">My father, before he died, sat down with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at night, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2351">And that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2352">Uh, he had a very good memory, and he counted out all the people, naming names, and I must have known personally maybe two-thirds of the people that he mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="2353">The others were not known to me.</sentence><sentence id="2354">But they were all the Willner family - it was a close, closely-knit family who all lived in the Rhineland of Germany, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne-Dusseldorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2355">So the distances weren't very great, they even weren't spread out over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">| think one lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, but the rest of them lived in the <span class="REGION">Rhineland</span> and had been living there for the past four hundred years.</sentence><sentence id="2357">I even have some documentation that I got in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, with the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors who first had the name of Willner and he had a Hebrew name of course too.</sentence><sentence id="2358">And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a German after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the families that he did his dissertation on.</sentence><sentence id="2359">And so when I visited recently, uh, I knew this before I went that in months of August and September, they inviting Jews back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as guests of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muchenglablak</span>, which have done some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2360">My name wasn't on the list to be there, but since I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on to some city officials to tell me someone visiting early and they made a joke of it.</sentence><sentence id="2361">They got their dates wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2362">And, uh I didn't get the dates wrong because this was a personal visit I was making to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and some other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2363">And uh, I agreed that I would see some city officials who wanted some advance information on what a person like me who comes back to his former <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> would feel like.</sentence><sentence id="2364">They had a lot of apprehension that for instance, one person in "85, an old lady, wrote them a letter and said, what is this good for, why reopen old wounds.</sentence><sentence id="2365">Why are you inviting us back here?</sentence><sentence id="2366">Well, to make a long story short, out of the people they invited, probably about 90% of the people are coming.</sentence><sentence id="2367">As the guests of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, for one week.</sentence><sentence id="2368">Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really wanted to know, particularly from one who got the worst.</sentence><sentence id="2369">In other words, they are inviting people back who escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2370">They are Holocaust survivors, but they were either in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span>, in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2371">But they didn't know how many had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2372">Since I had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and uh, also probably am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I was told, in the group that was coming back.</sentence><sentence id="2373">They wanted to know how I would feel about this, how I would feel about collective guilt, which by the way, I don't believe in collective guilt.</sentence><sentence id="2374">There are also good Germans just as well as there are bad Germans, and I am sorry to say that I've seen people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ... END OF TAPE but then he said I'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you are interested in this, that you're into what happened to your family, that you went in search of your family after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2375">I have a book that recently came out that the German government put out that has about 150,000 names, 125 or 150 thousand I don't remember exactly of German Jews that perished.</sentence><sentence id="2376">Conclusion of Interview.</sentence></p></dialogue>
