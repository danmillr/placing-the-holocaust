<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, September 4, 1925.</sentence><sentence id="12">My mother's name was Else Citroen Citon, which means lemon, and it is a Dutch name because her father was from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had come from -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and married my grandmother, Ellen Citreon Sileppe.</sentence><sentence id="13">Her name was Sileppe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">And so that is how the Dutch family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> because that's where they married.</sentence><sentence id="15">They were three children, the old-- four children actually, the oldest died very -- at 18.</sentence><sentence id="16">She was a poet and a wonderfully, well loved child, and she had a brain tumor and died.</sentence><sentence id="17">It took a while year and my youngest uncle tells that he has never seen his mother in anything but black ever after.</sentence><sentence id="18">So I saw her in other clothes, but he never saw her in anything but black as he grew up.</sentence><sentence id="19">At least that's how he sees it.</sentence><sentence id="20">People sees things in different ways.</sentence><sentence id="21">My mother, I remember as a childhood, as being relatively happy and her oldest brother was Paul, and he was lively and he was a painter.</sentence><sentence id="22">Didn't pay attention to anything but painting and art.</sentence><sentence id="23">And then she -- then it was she, and then it was a brother, Hans who also survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="24">The -- they all -- the brothers survived the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="25">Each of them had their own story, but they all survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="26">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and I had a sister, named Susannah who was three years younger than I was.</sentence><sentence id="27">And we -- my father was a lawyer, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hisberg</span>, Silesian, over Silesian, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verslomberland</span>, later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> for his Ph.D. in law.</sentence><sentence id="28">And he had a good practice.</sentence><sentence id="29">And he was quite old really.</sentence><sentence id="30">He was 35 when he married my mother.</sentence><sentence id="31">My mother was 20.</sentence><sentence id="32">That was done that way, that way, in those days.</sentence><sentence id="33">Anyway, I was born a year later and I remember my childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> as being wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="34">It was -- my father loved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and we went all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> as soon as I could walk.</sentence><sentence id="35">And he showed me absolutely everything.</sentence><sentence id="36">Every little <span class="NPIP">corner</span>, and he liked history and music and we went to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and I still remember where the Rembrandt hung in this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in Ber-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> because he loved it so.</sentence><sentence id="37">And I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Casovillan trains</span>, and the stories he told me about how Casovillan used to have big dinners in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and he was a very faster easter, Casovillan was.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">Nobody ever got anything to eat because he was always finished before the last person was served and everybody had to leave very hungry.</sentence><sentence id="39">This was one of my father's story, stories.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="40">And my sister was born three years later, and we were very happy.</sentence><sentence id="41">We always went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on vacation.</sentence><sentence id="42">And in 1933, when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on vacation, one of my many cousins of my father's, Uncle Biet Pierson who was a journalist, a editor of a paper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> said to my mother he felt that she should not go back.</sentence><sentence id="43">This was 1933.</sentence><sentence id="44">And Uncle Biet had, when he was very young -- when he was 19 and, and just learning to be a journalist, he had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to cover a trial.</sentence><sentence id="45">And nobody in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> paid in attention to this trial.</sentence><sentence id="46">And when he came back and he wrote up his paper, they said to him, "Why are you making such a fuss?"</sentence><sentence id="47">And he said, "You pay attention to this trial.</sentence><sentence id="48">This is going to end up being something quite awful and better everybody pay attention."</sentence><sentence id="49">It was Hitler's trial in 1923.</sentence><sentence id="50">And he was, you know, he was the only of them paid any attention to it.</sentence><sentence id="51">Took 10 years til things really heated up.</sentence><sentence id="52">So my mother, who always listened to my father because my father was the older one and, you know, he was the leader in our family said to my father, "I think we shouldn't go back."</sentence><sentence id="53">And my father said, "What does a lawyer do in a <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="54">That's not a very good idea, and what am I going to do?"</sentence><sentence id="55">And she said, "Well, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="56">You'll find something to do.</sentence><sentence id="57">It's -- I really think we should not go back."</sentence><sentence id="58">And so father said, "Well, I'm going to go back and see what I can do."</sentence><sentence id="59">I mean he had -- I think he graduated he'd already been a lawyer for 25 years.</sentence><sentence id="60">I mean it was -- it was practically impossible for him to start over.</sentence><sentence id="61">He spoke a few words of Dutch, but not very much.</sentence><sentence id="62">He got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and he went into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and there were his secretaries and his assistants and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="63">There was also a big letter from the government, which said that from now on, he could only have Jewish clients.</sentence><sentence id="64">My father had no -- had very few, I should say, Jewish clients.</sentence><sentence id="65">I didn't know any Jewish clients that he had.</sentence><sentence id="66">But he had things like the Mid- European Watch Industry, a___, Swiss Watch industry.</sentence><sentence id="67">He had big <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> that were his clients, and now he could not represent them anymore.</sentence><sentence id="68">He packed up.</sentence><sentence id="69">And we could still -- [mean he could ship as much as he wanted to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">And we had two grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span>, and he sold them because he didn't think that we could -- would have the money to have enough <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> big enough to hold grand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> so there was a big change in our standard of living.</sentence><sentence id="71">I mean I was raised with nurses and governesses and with English and French and you have Dutch and all those various things, with horse back riding and good <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, of course, we had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">My father had to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">He worked for a Dutch .</sentence><sentence id="75">He worked for a Dutch lawyer, but he had to learn Dutch, of course.</sentence><sentence id="76">He handled the clients who were very much like him who had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and, you know, he couldn't practice along because he didn't have the Dutch degree.</sentence><sentence id="77">So he went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and I think he was now -- how old was he in "34, 35?</sentence><sentence id="78">He graduated in three years in a foreign language.</sentence><sentence id="79">I was -- we were very proud of him.</sentence><sentence id="80">It was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="81">He also worked at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="82">There was a big party and everybody came and then a few years later the Germans walked in, and it was all over.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="83">We are now getting to the point where my -- Let me go back and say that when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I got to my first <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, in my class was a girl named Margo Frank.</sentence><sentence id="84">And they lived right behind us on the .</sentence><sentence id="85">We lived at the which was the back of the same kind of development that they lived in.</sentence><sentence id="86">And we -- we always played at____.</sentence><sentence id="87">That's how we met.</sentence><sentence id="88">And then our parents, of course, met, having coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the same year and having a lot of common and the Frank's and my parents socialized a lot and, of course, the kids played.</sentence><sentence id="89">As a matter of fact, Margo dragged me through <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Without her, I would have never made anything done anything because I was full of play and I was -- wanted to become a dancer and I worked very, very hard at that, but not at much else.</sentence><sentence id="91">So without her saying, "Today, we study," I wouldn't have been able to get through.</sentence><sentence id="92">So here we are in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and working hard and my sister's doing very, very well.</sentence><sentence id="93">She was very smart.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="94">And my father had great hopes she'd become a lawyer like he was.</sentence><sentence id="95">He would've like me to become a lawyer, but I think he gave up on me long -- very early because that was not my thing.</sentence><sentence id="96">I was more the way my mother's family was.</sentence><sentence id="97">More playful and -- and liked imaginary games and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="98">Let's see, where shall we go now?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Let's -- let's talk a little more about your friends and your childhood.</sentence><sentence id="100">Did you meet Ann Frank too?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Well, of course, we all played together, you know.</sentence><sentence id="102">And Ann came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a lot and we went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a lot.</sentence><sentence id="103">When my kids grew up, I -- I could see that, you know, the same kind of thing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="104">You -- you go around to the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and you work together for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and you do various things and My sister was a lot more serious than Ann was.</sentence><sentence id="105">Anne liked games the way I did.</sentence><sentence id="106">And she liked to play and have imagina -- imaginary games, and she was very high strung -- very easily

child.</sentence><sentence id="109">And not just for her family, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she went to a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I think or Dalton in one of those two kinds of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">And she did very well there.</sentence><sentence id="111">Not as well as Margaret, who was an absolute genius, if you ask me.</sentence><sentence id="112">But who -- Margaret also was very calm, and at

she was very anxious to be very close to me which was amazing, you know, for a young girl.</sentence><sentence id="120">She wanted to see what I was doing and later on, as I got older, she was very interested in my friends and she always had very -- a lot of good advice for me.</sentence><sentence id="121">This is no good, and this is very good, and you know, she was just -- and she was so sensible.</sentence><sentence id="122">It was amazing!</sentence><sentence id="123">One of the letters I gave you is from her, and there you will see all that.</sentence><sentence id="124">It's a very good letter.</sentence><sentence id="125">Very, very young girl!</sentence><sentence id="126">Anyway, we had a normal, very happy kind of childhood with a lot of music and my Uncle Paul was a painter

--</sentence><sentence id="194">at that point I realize it was all German.</sentence><sentence id="195">It wasn't really my family that created that kind of atmosphere, but it was more when we were on our own, without family, you know, that it suddenly appeared that I really was in a German Jewish circle.</sentence><sentence id="196">This was when we were trying to save ourselves, you understand?</sentence><sentence id="197">As -- as children we played altogether -- everybody played together and was very good relationships between everybody.</sentence><sentence id="198">I've never heard my parents or Otto Frank, who by the way was an absolute angel, ever, you know, say anything nasty or have -- had any kind of problem with Dutch with the Dutch people.</sentence><sentence id="199">And, of course, I was half Dutch anyway.</sentence><sentence id="200">And the first time I realized I really wasn't Dutch was when the Germans came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and there was five days where -- before -- before the Queen left <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, while the Germans were there -- while the Dutch were fighting the Germans we were not allowed -- we had a great curfew.</sentence><sentence id="201">We were not allowed in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">And my grandparents and my neighbors had to bring -- my grandmother and my neighbor had to bring us food and everything because they wouldn't allow Germans -- we were then taken as Germans, not -- not as German Jews, but as Germans, and we weren't allowed to go out and to buy food except very limited periods of time during the day.</sentence><sentence id="203">It was the first time that I realized that "Hey.</sentence><sentence id="204">Hey.</sentence><sentence id="205">I'm really German.</sentence><sentence id="206">I'm not really Dutch."</sentence><sentence id="207">I never, you know, it -- I wasn't even aware of it, except when I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">I was in the -- I was in the 3rd Grade.</sentence><sentence id="209">I was put into the 3rd Grade.</sentence><sentence id="210">I was eight years old.</sentence><sentence id="211">And I had to write what they called in which write, you know, somebody reads something to you and you write it down.</sentence><sentence id="212">I had 40 mistakes I think in -- in 30 words, or something like that because I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="213">I think even Margo had 25 mistakes, but still it was a lot less than I had.</sentence><sentence id="214">That was -- you know, there I realized, you know, that it..that it was hard.</sentence><sentence id="215">And my clothes were all wrong.</sentence><sentence id="216">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was very -- we were very elegant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="217">I had fur coats and a hat -- you know, ridiculous really if you think about it now, it's -- but that's how it was in those days.</sentence><sentence id="218">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, the kids were pretty much more still more ____, more plain, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">And the clothes I had were absolutely inappropriate.</sentence><sentence id="220">So at some point there, I said to my mother, "This is it.</sentence><sentence id="221">That coat goes."</sentence><sentence id="222">I had a Russian -- I had Russian coat which was embroidered with a Russian hat, you know, with the embroidery around and stuff and I said, "Never am I going to wear this thing again."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: The <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="804">Well, the -- the headmaster called assembly and made a large, big speech about the fact that, you know, about the Germans and that we were a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we shall remain free and we all sang the song, you know, the national anthem, and.</sentence><sentence id="805">Anyway, he got picked up very early, and he died very early because that was -- somebody, of course, told on him.</sentence><sentence id="806">They were fascists in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">And then one started to hear about fascists right and left.</sentence><sentence id="808">And one started to hear about our neighbors downstairs who turned out to be not too good, and then we suddenly started to hear things like our neighbors on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> -- well, he was Jewish, but she was not.</sentence><sentence id="809">Boy, they're lucky.</sentence><sentence id="810">I mean things like that, you know, which you'd

id="812">As far as the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was concermed, I think we could go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a little while, but then, again, there was an assembly and we were told that the Jewish kids now had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and go to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, and have be separated from the others.</sentence><sentence id="813">And I went to my parents and -- and I said, "I don't want to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">I'm not going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="815">I will not go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="816">And I can just see my children

class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">My sister did.</sentence><sentence id="822">She went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="823">And it was very frightening because what the Germans started to do is to isolate the Jews into various groups.</sentence><sentence id="824">I mean they -- at a later date, not right then in the beginning, but at a later date, they would go and pick up the kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and then make the parents come to get the kids and, of course, keep the parents and that was the end of that you know.</sentence><sentence id="825">Some people were then sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again if their parents had good papers, you know some kind of exceptional papers.</sentence><sentence id="826">But I was -- every time I heard that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- the Germans or -- or green police or the Dutch cooperators -- the Nazis, the Dutch Nazi, and anaspears.</sentence><sentence id="827">They were called then anaspears marching toward the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you know, I would run to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and finally after I had Monfred as a friend, he said to me, "The one thing you do when the Germans go somewhere is not go there."</sentence><sentence id="828">You know, I 1 mean I was so stupid, but we all -- most of us were because what did we know, you know, about how to save yourself and that you had to save yourself.</sentence><sentence id="829">You had to be careful.</sentence><sentence id="830">You have to learn to be scared.</sentence><sentence id="831">And I was not that scared.</sentence><sentence id="832">You know, I was dumb.</sentence><sentence id="833">I was plain old dumb.</sentence><sentence id="834">But it was very frightening to have my sister in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> separated in the eastern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="835">We lived in the south and they had to go to_Oster, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> -- <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: Let's get back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="935">So anyway, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was -- I went to Alice Kayser, and I went there for -- as long as my parents were there and could pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="936">I went to Alice Kayser.</sentence><sentence id="937">In the end she was also taken away.</sentence><sentence id="938">And

had to make -- to earn money and and this is what she did.</sentence><sentence id="947">She had help, of course.</sentence><sentence id="948">And one day they came and took everybody including her.</sentence><sentence id="949">They had just emptied out the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="950">The Germans they had came.</sentence><sentence id="951">And my mother was beside herself -- beside herself.</sentence><sentence id="952">What to do?</sentence><sentence id="953">We had to get her back.</sentence><sentence id="954">Now the youngest brother, my mother's

class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="956">The older brother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span>, near The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gosmer</span> and had no funds, you know, whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="957">So my mother went and took our jewelry to a <span

free.</sentence><sentence id="959">And he said to her that she had to give industrial -- the Germans would take industrial diamonds for my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="960">Well, my mother went and gave to Nave who was a jeweler, her jewelry and said, "I need industrial diamonds.</sentence><sentence id="961">Just see what you can do."</sentence><sentence id="962">And Nave came back and said there are no more industrial -- you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was closed up and -- there were other people besides us that were looking for that -- industrial diamonds and -- and he didn't have any more.</sentence><sentence id="963">So Putcomer told the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="964">The Germans came back and said we will take gold bullion -- gold bars, thick gold bars.</sentence><sentence id="965">So my mother said to Nave, "It's gold bars.</sentence><sentence id="966">Get us gold bars."</sentence><sentence id="967">And then Nave managed to make or get or somehow gold bars, using my mother's jewelry as payment.</sentence><sentence id="968">And I remember that one day after my class at -- was it after class -- I think -- well, whenever I was told to go on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and pick up a package from Nave.</sentence><sentence id="969">And I had -- I had two bags, you know, these -- these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch

<span class="NPIP">side</span> was -- was -- the gold bouillon.</sentence><sentence id="971">And Nave just handled them to me.</sentence><sentence id="972">I think he wrapped him.</sentence><sentence id="973">Not very much.</sentence><sentence id="974">I saw them.</sentence><sentence id="975">And I brought them to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="976">And my mother gave them to Mr.Putcomer and Mr. Putcomer gave them to the Germans and my grandmother got out.</sentence><sentence id="977">And she then, of course, she couldn't live in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because that was -- they closed the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="978">So she came and lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="979">And it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="980">I mean, for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="981">It was extremely hard to have another mouth to feed.</sentence><sentence id="982">It was very -- it started -- you had to start buying on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="983">It was starting to be very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="984">I don't know if we already had ration coupons at this time or not but any case and my mother was so worried about my grandmother -- that she would be sick.</sentence><sentence id="985">She was in pretty good shape, but she was a tyrannical old lady.</sentence><sentence id="986">And I can just see my poor mother between my father, who was so scared he was starting to get heart trouble and a little ulcer and -- and trying to keep us kids calm and trying to run the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and trying to get the food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we -- it must have been -- and she started to get very, very thin.</sentence><sentence id="987">1 mean my mother got very thin.</sentence><sentence id="988">And I -- I was very busy with myself.</sentence><sentence id="989">I was discovering boys and I was 16 and, you know, I..and but I even noticed she was getting very, very thin.</sentence><sentence id="990">And I -- I loved her to distraction.</sentence><sentence id="991">I mean she was my one solid --

id="1337">And they would -- at that point they did not just pick up everybody, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1338">They -- they came with lists and they picked up people by name and they took -- I know I remember it as today, they picked up old Mrs. Triman Mr. Triman was married to a Gentile lady and he was okay.</sentence><sentence id="1339">But they picked up his mother.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And she could hardly walk.</sentence><sentence id="1341">She was a very old lady, and I -- my stomach -- they were good friends of ours.</sentence><sentence id="1342">My stomach just turned.</sentence><sentence id="1343">They picked up all the people I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1344">And they stopped about two <span class="DLF">stoops</span> before ours -- two -- you know, two <span class="DLF">platforms</span> before ours.</sentence><sentence id="1345">And, however, Monfred always knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1346">And he knew -- he lived in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1347">And he knew that they were doing our <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1348">And he sent this Leo

id="1351">He had -- wore a long leather coat and he was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor bike</span> and had hood on.</sentence><sentence id="1352">I mean you can imagine he looked like.</sentence><sentence id="1353">And right in the middle of all this going on, the <span class="DLF">door</span> bell rang and, of course, we -- my parents thought they were gonna -- I mean I thought I was gonna die and we thought how come.</sentence><sentence id="1354">You know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> aren't this far away.</sentence><sentence id="1355">They aren't at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="1356">How come?</sentence><sentence id="1357">What's going on?And it was Leo Vial, and he came to get me.</sentence><sentence

id="1361">Right?</sentence><sentence id="1362">So I put my false papers in my pocket and I said to my, of course, the J was not on my clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1363">I took it off.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And I said to my father, "Goodbye."</sentence><sentence id="1365">He grabbed me, and he kicked Leo down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and Leo drove off and

there and they didn't trust me because I was blabber mouth and everything, but they said -- they said to Monfred, "Hide her if you can."</sentence><sentence id="1372">And that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1373">Monfred's father had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they made cosmetics, I think, and soap bottles and all this little stuff, and the first night

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2135">Monfred's sister, Marga, whose picture you have was a very inventive and a very intelligent, very bright young

id="2138">But she had always sort of helped support with sewing.</sentence><sentence id="2139">She was a genius in -- in clothing design and manufacturing.</sentence><sentence id="2140">And she always was much more practical.</sentence><sentence id="2141">She wasn't at all a girl who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or anything, but she always had her hand in things.</sentence><sentence id="2142">And she know how to get acquainted with people that were important.</sentence><sentence id="2143">for her!</sentence><sentence id="2144">For what she wanted!</sentence><sentence id="2145">She saw an ad in a paper for the upstairs of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the Valarstraat with a family of Anespairs -- actually Dutch fascists.</sentence><sentence id="2146">And she went there.</sentence><sentence id="2147">And she said, "We would like that.</sentence><sentence id="2148">We would very much like that and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and there will be various number of people because all of us travel.</sentence><sentence id="2149">We work for the German for the Wehrmacht and we do this and we do that -- you know, speaking German very well.</sentence><sentence id="2150">And this was a Dutch woman who could not speak German very well.</sentence><sentence id="2151">Her husband was an Anespair and -- and she and her son were living down <span class="DLF">stairs</span> while the guy worked for the Germans somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2152">And that's how they got that first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2153">So it was a pretty safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work -- live if you didn't give it away.</sentence><sentence id="2154">If not something, you know, you couldn't have <span class="BUILDING">assemblies</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="2155">You couldn't -- you know, you had to take into account what kind of <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was, but all of us, nearly all of us -- of this particular group were not hidden away like Ann Frank was where you couldn't move.</sentence><sentence id="2156">I mean we all were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2157">It was dangerous, very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="2158">I mean I was well known in <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2163">And I wasn't in the exact same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2164">I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> south, but it was the old south, rather than the new south.</sentence><sentence id="2165">And I was not as well known there, except by a few people.</sentence><sentence id="2166">So the way they made your papers, your false papers -- they gave you the same first name that you really had.</sentence><sentence id="2167">So if somebody would suddenly see you and yell, "Hey, Barbara," it would be okay.</sentence><sentence id="2168">You don't call each by the last name so you know -- so-- That's my paper -- my name always was Barbara, which was very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2169">So that was why I went to see Monfred that night when we after -- or that morning after my parents were taken.</sentence><sentence id="2170">Anyway, I heard that they were all taken away, and they -- again, they tried to get free with these papers, but the papers were now null and void.</sentence><sentence id="2171">It was pass the period that these papers would do anything for anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2172">And they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span>, which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2173">In the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">assembly camp</span> was already my cousin Heinz.</sentence><sentence id="2174">I've told you about him and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2175">My cousin Heintz was hidden through the Dutch underground -- some kind of <span class="DLF">channel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2176">The way -- the way it seemed to have happened was all through individuals.</sentence><sentence id="2177">You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2178">There wasn't a great big organization where people all knew each other.</sentence><sentence id="2179">It was one person knew another knew another knew another.</sentence><sentence id="2180">The less you knew the better, because if you get caught you can give away maybe one person.</sentence><sentence id="2181">Maybe!</sentence><sentence id="2182">If you were not tough as nails.</sentence><sentence id="2183">And this is what happened with my aunt and uncle.</sentence><sentence id="2184">They -- rather my cousin.</sentence><sentence id="2185">They were hidden by a -- a Dutch family, and it so happened that the son of that Dutch family also did other things.</sentence><sentence id="2186">Most people who hid people were not allowed to do anything else, but they, of course, didn't 3 know about their son who was receiving weapons which were dropped by the British in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the resistance -- to be used by the resistance in the middle of the night -- .planes that flew low, you know, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And he he was given away by somebody and they came to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took -- they took the men.</sentence><sentence id="2188">Just the men.</sentence><sentence id="2189">Not my cousin, my cousin Ava.</sentence><sentence id="2190">They didn't take her or the wife.</sentence><sentence id="2191">And Ava was immediately put somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2192">But Heinz was caught and he was then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span> as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2193">The -- This other person -- the Gentile survived the war which was a miracle, but he had somebody who got him out in somewhere.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2258">A: To me.</sentence><sentence id="2259">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2260">Well, my Uncle Heintz -- my cousin Heintz was already in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span>, and he, of course, he saw his mother.</sentence><sentence id="2261">He saw my mother.</sentence><sentence id="2262">He saw my father.</sentence><sentence id="2263">He saw my sister.</sentence><sentence id="2264">He saw my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="2265">All going through there!</sentence><sentence id="2266">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heintz</span> did survive the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2267">There were very, very few people who did.</sentence><sentence id="2268">There were -- I think there were 300 at the end.</sentence><sentence id="2269">And he was one of them who survived.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And they actually kept him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a little while just to make sure he didn't happen to be -- because of his German, again, his German business.</sentence><sentence id="2271">But he wasn't a German who was trying to hide as a Jew -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span>, which happened a heck ofa lot.</sentence><sentence id="2272">I mean, any -- later on, it was the Germans who were trying to save their lives and -- and hide and -- and try to stay alive.</sentence><sentence id="2273">What about me?</sentence><sentence id="2274">During the war, I must say that most of the war really spent standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food.</sentence><sentence id="2275">Because of the way I looked I could do that.</sentence><sentence id="2276">And we had -- we hid a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="2277">And that really was -- after reading the book, I realize that it was true, that what the little groups did was try to help themselves and each other staying alive.</sentence><sentence id="2278">It was less a big picture, you know, that you -- that the underground would attack something or somebody, although I guess that happened, but not with us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2300">Q: Tell us about you!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2302">A: About me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2304">Q: I'm not interested in the book right now.</sentence><sentence id="2305">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="2306">I want to know about you and what you did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2310">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2311">I stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food.</sentence><sentence id="2312">I also did a few other things.</sentence><sentence id="2313">I was -- as -- as I say, they had to be careful with me because I was pretty stupid.</sentence><sentence id="2314">And I -- they put me to work -- they put me -- I was a dancer.</sentence><sentence id="2315">Right?</sentence><sentence id="2316">And there was a ballet company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdan</span> run by Evan Geeorgi, -- Evan Geeorgi who was a great dancer from somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> -- something like that, and she was put by the Germans in into the Dutch large state theater to run the ballet company.</sentence><sentence id="2317">I went into her <span class="BUILDING">ballet school</span> and took classes and I was then asked to join the company.</sentence><sentence id="2318">And I asked if -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, "Was it alright?" "</sentence><sentence id="2319">Oh, Yes!"</sentence><sentence id="2320">Because you got fantastic papers when you went there -- into this <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2321">Because the company traveled, you got papers to be out after curfew.</sentence><sentence id="2322">And that way I could help shift people from one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> to another or like American soldiers -- shot down people other people who were underground -- .</sentence><sentence id="2323">And let me tell you how this was 4 done.</sentence><sentence id="2324">There were no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2325">And there were very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, because there was no gasoline for them to use.</sentence><sentence id="2326">So what they had was people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> pulling, you know, like in <span class="REGION">third world countries</span>, they would pull little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> behind them.</sentence><sentence id="2327">Some of them were covered so that when it rained, which it does a lot in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, you know, people wouldn't get wet.</sentence><sentence id="2328">And others were open.</sentence><sentence id="2329">All sorts of various ways of transportation.</sentence><sentence id="2330">And the few people that I moved were moved in the middle of the night, you know, I mean after curfew.</sentence><sentence id="2331">With them being the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and me sitting, you know, sitting like this bent over and me sitting on top on -- on sitting on their backs with a rather short skirt and my very good papers, with make-up on still from the ballet and when the Germans stuck their -- when the Dutch police stuck their head in there and saying, "What is this?"</sentence><sentence id="2332">you know.</sentence><sentence id="2333">Curfew is on -- you could -- I would have a smile and papers.</sentence><sentence id="2334">And I shifted a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="2335">That way!</sentence><sentence id="2336">You know, from one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> that had gotten dangerous to another one which is new, hopefully better.</sentence><sentence id="2337">And I did little things like that.</sentence><sentence id="2338">Also, Monfred would distribute the ____ which was the communist newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2339">Marga was distributing the __ which was the regular -- the -- the other <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2340">And I would be sent carrying bags of those with lettuce and tomatoes and carrots on top.</sentence><sentence id="2341">And, again, you know I would be -- I would be told, "You bring this to a certain little <span class="DLF">portal</span> with and just somebody will come and get it."</sentence><sentence id="2342">I didn't know who was going to get it.</sentence><sentence id="2343">I didn't know when they were there.</sentence><sentence id="2344">If they were there before me or after me.</sentence><sentence id="2345">I -- you know, I would go.</sentence><sentence id="2346">I would watch the <span class="DLF">portal</span> and if I saw somebody go into a specific corner of it, and not ring the bell or -- or, you know, whatever it was that I thought these were the right people, I would walk up with the bag.</sentence><sentence id="2347">And if they took it, they were the right people.</sentence><sentence id="2348">If they didn't, I would walk on.</sentence><sentence id="2349">Little things like that.</sentence><sentence id="2350">I also Marga's fiance -- we were constantly short of money of course.</sentence><sentence id="2351">That was a big problem.</sentence><sentence id="2352">And Monfred in his letter to me just now said that some money we had because some more jewelry of my -- they had a lot of jewelry that was being sold and I had little pieces left that I could sell.</sentence><sentence id="2353">It was sold to Dutch people who, you know, wanted it as an investment.</sentence><sentence id="2354">And the money was used for us to eat and -- and live, rent and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="2355">Later on Leo Vial would transport Dutch workers to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">We tried to mix-up people, because the Germans were taking all the young people to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work in those <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, not particularly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, just in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> while their own people went to the various fronts.</sentence><sentence id="2357">And we would mix-up these.</sentence><sentence id="2358">We would have Frenchmen in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and Dutchman -- and when the Germans would find them, the French would say, "We were sent here to work in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and for the Dutch -- for the German industry," And the Dutchman in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would say, "But we were shipped here by the Germans to work for the for the French industry."</sentence><sentence id="2359">I mean it was a total mix-up.</sentence><sentence id="2360">Some people also would be sent, if we were lucky, would be sent through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and would then join the Dutch Free Forces on the British 8th Brigade in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> if one would be able to get there.</sentence><sentence id="2361">But our Leo only took them to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Well, on his way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he would often bring suitcases full of lipsticks and , you know, all these wonderful French things that you couldn't get.</sentence><sentence id="2363">And perfumes and other things that the French and that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And then me, I would be sent to sell them.</sentence><sentence id="2365">And I would go to -- he even wrote the addresses down where I would go to sell them downtown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2366">And people would buy them like crazy.</sentence><sentence id="2367">I mean I didn't -- I sold them <span class="BUILDING">wholesale</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2368">I sold the whole suitcase full all at once, and we would eat.</sentence><sentence id="2369">And one time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I saw the Dutch police all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, watching -- in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2370">Well, I knew enough, 5 Thank God, not to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2371">So I stood on the corner watching til they came back out and -- and they had made a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="2372">Of course, they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2373">I don't know what Monfred did, but he got rid of them.</sentence><sentence id="2374">And -- I mean there -- there were always -- always these horrible moments, you know, where you think, "Now, this is it.</sentence><sentence id="2375">This is it."</sentence><sentence id="2376">And also one time I drove -- rode my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> up a one-way street the wrong way.</sentence><sentence id="2377">I..I was really confused.</sentence><sentence id="2378">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> and there was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2379">And I got stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2380">And, of course, they looked at my papers.</sentence><sentence id="2381">By that time, I had much better papers.</sentence><sentence id="2382">Now, with the dancing, that ended because somebody told Evan that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2383">Now she was supposedly pro-Hitler and pro this and pro that, but she knew that I was Jewish and she never did anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="2384">Never!</sentence><sentence id="2385">She called -- did call me in and she said, "It would be better if you had a little more training before you go on further trips."</sentence><sentence id="2386">She put that very well.</sentence><sentence id="2387">She never said, you know, "I put you into this company because you were so good and what the Hell have you done to me?"</sentence><sentence id="2388">She said exactly what I told you.</sentence><sentence id="2389">She said, "A little more training would be good for you, so just go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2390">So that she -- you know, wouldn't be endangered and I would be must less endangered.</sentence><sentence id="2391">And the strange thing was that she had been told by people who were actually watching out for me.</sentence><sentence id="2392">Was a different group of people.</sentence><sentence id="2393">It was Maria Austria and her friend, , who are all in the book who thought it was much too dangerous for me to do what I did, and who didn't want me to do it.</sentence><sentence id="2394">And I wouldn't listen.</sentence><sentence id="2395">And so that's how they did it.</sentence><sentence id="2396">They went and they told Yvonne Geoorgi_ about that.</sentence><sentence id="2397">So I have -- I have a picture of Yvonne Geeorgi which she had signed for me and -- and, you know, and I gave her her book and we -- we left.</sentence><sentence id="2398">I never did believe that was really a fascist.</sentence><sentence id="2399">She was a artist who -- who maybe didn't have as much character as one was supposed to have, but she was a German and she was -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2400">I -- who's going to throw the first stone.</sentence><sentence id="2401">She didn't kill me.</sentence><sentence id="2402">She was good to me.</sentence><sentence id="2403">Really.</sentence><sentence id="2404">And after the war, when all the artists marched -- you know in the -- in the -- what's the big festival after we were liberated -- liberated?</sentence><sentence id="2405">I was not allowed to march because I had worked for the German, you know, in the ballet, during -- Nobody ever said -- nobody ever said: But she did it because of the papers.</sentence><sentence id="2406">The underground didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2407">Monfred didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2408">Nobody -- I mean, Monfred probably didn't think it was very important.</sentence><sentence id="2409">I thought it was terrible!</sentence><sentence id="2410">I should have been able to march with the others and, anyway, this is after war stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2411">That's German -- Dutch bureaucracy kicked in and -- and everything was -- was, you know, back to the way they thought life should be run.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2514">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2515">We need to pause here and change tapes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2518">6 Tape #3</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2520">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2521">Now we go.</sentence><sentence id="2522">You were going to tell us a little more about your underground activities, particularly in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">smuggling packages</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2526">A: I didn't smuggle.</sentence><sentence id="2527">I sent them by mail.</sentence><sentence id="2528">The Germans would let you send packages to people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerborg</span>, and I managed during the nine months that my parents were there -- I managed to send a lot of packages.</sentence><sentence id="2529">And I was always collecting things, you know, as I went along.</sentence><sentence id="2530">And, of course, we had ration coupons so it was hard, and I always got letters back.</sentence><sentence id="2531">Actually, we had mail from there.</sentence><sentence id="2532">Regular mail -- .regular mail from my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2533">And the mail I guess was read, but it was sent on.</sentence><sentence id="2534">And they received everything I sent.</sentence><sentence id="2535">Nothing was dis -- had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="2536">I also want to say that, you know, when they were taken away that I never knew that they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2537">I didn't know where they had gone.</sentence><sentence id="2538">I heard they had been sent on, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2539">And it now appears that it was in January of "44.</sentence><sentence id="2540">And it was -- it was a terrible shock.</sentence><sentence id="2541">It was just really incredible shock.</sentence><sentence id="2542">And I also want to say that I think I survived because I was 17 or you know, by that time 19.</sentence><sentence id="2543">It's the sort and it was exciting, you know, this living alone and not knowing -- everyday it was something else, and not knowing what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="2544">The drudgery, you know, of trying to get food and of survival and -- Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2545">At 19 they felt I was getting old enough to do some other things also.</sentence><sentence id="2546">You know, since I couldn't be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ballet</span> anymore, I had to be good for something.</sentence><sentence id="2547">And besides standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for food, which was hard in the winter in the rain and in the cold I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="2548">We took care of a lot of other people who were underground who could not be out.</sentence><sentence id="2549">I mean from the point of view of -- I didn't particularly see these people, but I had to supply food, you know, get food for them.</sentence><sentence id="2550">Somebody made me or helped me -- I forgot how, but I rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2551">Was the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with the same <span class="DLF">street</span>, the 91, you know, where we had been before.</sentence><sentence id="2552">This was now an 86.</sentence><sentence id="2553">was on the second floor of 80 -- number 86 in the <span class="BUILDING">Valarastratt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2554">We might have just heard that it was coming free, you know, because we were right there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2555">Anyway, it was rented under my name my false name, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2556">And then a very difficult time started.</sentence><sentence id="2557">Very difficult!</sentence><sentence id="2558">First of all, we went into the hunger winter.</sentence><sentence id="2559">You know the time that the south was liberated, south being <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Braba</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">north Braba</span>, and all those.</sentence><sentence id="2560">And that only did <span class="REGION">provinces</span> around _____ were still occupied and was coming up along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and we were stuck in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2561">Not only us, but also the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2562">They couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="2563">And this was the first time that they also had less food.</sentence><sentence id="2564">They started to be hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2565">And we started -- they started to be scared of the underground who had all the weapons -- had so many weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And they had weapons, but they were mostly old men and kids, you know, and it was just a very, very scary situation.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And during that time I had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had big <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2568">And I met the neighbors from across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and they were telling me that the people downstairs would go upstairs to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when we were out and steal the food out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2569">Well, that was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2570">But we also were hiding people there.</sentence><sentence id="2571">And that was another thing!</sentence><sentence id="2572">Right?</sentence><sentence id="2573">And the -- imagine them running into these people.</sentence><sentence id="2574">So we had <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2575">You know, we had <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> -- what used to be <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span>, was now papered over and there was an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> via the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and there was a rug that went up to it.</sentence><sentence id="2576">And, of course, the people we hid knew how to get into these <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2577">Of course, the Germans weren't stupid either and if something was going in -- 7 on, you know, if they did have a rautsea_, if they did have a check into various <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, they would stick their bayonets into the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and into the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and, you know, looking for people.</sentence><sentence id="2578">And There was one guy which was assigned to our -- to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I lived with Monfred and with various other people of the group whoever was around at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2579">And this man was, I think, a Czech -- Czechish communist.</sentence><sentence id="2580">And he would give lectures in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we weren't allowed to have more than three or four people, so this very scary, and I started to be very scared.</sentence><sentence id="2581">And, first of all, I didn't like what he said and I said to Mon, "You know, I do not want this anymore.</sentence><sentence id="2582">This is my apart -- you know, I hired under my name and I would -- I'm responsible and it's dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And these people, they will tell on us.</sentence><sentence id="2584">And Monfred said, It's nothing to be done.</sentence><sentence id="2585">We have to have him."</sentence><sentence id="2586">He also had to have his wife on weekends.</sentence><sentence id="2587">So she was hidden somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2588">RIght?</sentence><sentence id="2589">But on weekends, she came to our <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2590">And one day this -- this one woman and I who took care of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> were told that the Germans were going to check into <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and in several in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2591">So we had to move him.</sentence><sentence id="2592">We had to move him.</sentence><sentence id="2593">And we moved him at night some -- to another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2594">And then we had to clean up to see that they didn't see that there had been a man anywhere, because there was supposed to be two women living in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2595">So we started -- we went into his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he had left everything.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Cigars!</sentence><sentence id="2597">First of all, how did he have cigars?</sentence><sentence id="2598">Nobody had cigars.</sentence><sentence id="2599">Apples!Foods!</sentence><sentence id="2600">Cheese!</sentence><sentence id="2601">We didn't give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="2602">How did he get it?</sentence><sentence id="2603">And when -- finally when all this was over, you know, the Germans never did come to visit -- to us to check up, but when it was all over, I said to my friend, "I do not want this guy."</sentence><sentence id="2604">It's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="2605">1 mean he was a hoarder, somebody who hoarded things.</sentence><sentence id="2606">We were supposed to share everything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2607">This was very important.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And he was a communist.</sentence><sentence id="2609">He should know how to share.</sentence><sentence id="2610">Anyway, he -- I told Monfred, "he has to go."</sentence><sentence id="2611">And Monfred got very, very angry.</sentence><sentence id="2612">They beat up on me because they were so angry that I would, you know, and I -- and they said, "Well, what can you do to us.</sentence><sentence id="2613">You can't do anything anything to us."</sentence><sentence id="2614">I said -- and I stupid -- my old stupid, I said, "Yes, I can go to the police."</sentence><sentence id="2615">Can you believe it?</sentence><sentence id="2616">I was just impossibly stupid.</sentence><sentence id="2617">I mean I was so desperate.</sentence><sentence id="2618">You know I thought we're all going to be caught.</sentence><sentence id="2619">You know, we're all -- and -- and I'll never forget that guy.</sentence><sentence id="2620">It was awful, and his red headed wife.</sentence><sentence id="2621">Impossible!</sentence><sentence id="2622">So anyway, those are -- were some of the adventures, you know, during the -- and, of course, the Americans -- New Year's Eve -- American soldiers, who had to be hidden, you know, from -- they would be shot down by the Germans over -- the -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would come flying.</sentence><sentence id="2623">They were full of bombs, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2624">And on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he might have a bomb left.</sentence><sentence id="2625">And they would drop a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="2626">They would just drop the bomb -- the -- the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="2627">So sometimes the Germans got one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, and we got somebody to hide -- English, American, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2628">New Year's Eve, the American went on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and shot off his gun.</sentence><sentence id="2629">I mean I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2630">Ohhhh!</sentence><sentence id="2631">So -- uh -- then the -- the hunger got so great that the -- and we got to the end -- toward the end, you know, the Germans knew -- toward the end.</sentence><sentence id="2632">And they let the Red Cross drop food in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> -- in and around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2633">And the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> -- we had <span class="DLF">flat roofs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2634">You know, the roofs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> behind the decorations are flat.</sentence><sentence id="2635">So they dropped cases of food on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> or in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> or in open <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, and the Germans were so scared by that time they didn't dare to pick them up.</sentence><sentence id="2636">And the underground and -- I -- the food was distributed evenly, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2637">You had to give whatever -- if you found one on your <span class="DLF">roof</span>, you know, you better take it.</sentence><sentence id="2638">And we were all starving.</sentence><sentence id="2639">We were really -- the bread was 8 -- had gone sour.</sentence><sentence id="2640">We ate everything, you know, that -- that they dropped.</sentence><sentence id="2641">And then the -- we heard that the Canadians were coming to liberate us.</sentence><sentence id="2642">I haven't told you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akmier</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2762">Q: I'd like you to go back and tell us about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akmier</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2764">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2765">Well, toward the end of the war, I kept hearing about a man man Almier who was a German, and who did fantastic things for the underground, the Dutch underground.</sentence><sentence id="2766">And Monfred said one day that Akmier's place of hiding was not very good and Akmier should, perhaps, if it was alright -- it was my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- right? --</sentence><sentence id="2767">Akmier should come to us.</sentence><sentence id="2768">Well, Akmier came to visit -- to see if that was alright.</sentence><sentence id="2769">Well we also arranged a girl for him to come that he might like.</sentence><sentence id="2770">We wanted him to come because it was dangerous for him.</sentence><sentence id="2771">We didn't want him to get into trouble.</sentence><sentence id="2772">Now it turned out that -- that he was -- he really had to stay where he was he felt for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="2773">And the underground came to him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monfred</span> and said you have to get him out of there because if he is -- when we get liberated, if he is where he is now, we might have to send him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or anyway he'll be in deep trouble.</sentence><sentence id="2774">And so they sent me to get him.</sentence><sentence id="2775">And I went over there I said you have to come and stay us and you have to come.</sentence><sentence id="2776">You have to come.</sentence><sentence id="2777">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akmier</span> came.</sentence><sentence id="2778">And then I heard his whole story.</sentence><sentence id="2779">He -- he was a German -- was involved in a Munich story where the six people were hanged.</sentence><sentence id="2780">Six students -- they turned over a whole suitcase full of pamphlets on -- on an assembly in -- of <span class="BUILDING">Munich University</span> full of anti-Hitler propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="2781">And in one -- of course, they all got caught.</sentence><sentence id="2782">I mean it was very early on and nobody knew what to do.</sentence><sentence id="2783">So -- so in one of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">books</span> was his name? --</sentence><sentence id="2784">in one of his -- the notebooks, address books was his name, and somehow they managed to get him out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2785">He had just finished his medical studies and he was sent to <span class="BUILDING">Villemina Hot Towers</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, which is a <span class="BUILDING">mental institution</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, and he was supposed to study further psychiatry.</sentence><sentence id="2786">He wanted to go into <span class="BUILDING">psychiatry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2787">So he studied there and worked there, and he started working with the underground.</sentence><sentence id="2788">And he -- he's the one -- one of the people who supplied us with all the serums -- of in..inoculations, of all the diseases you caught during the war.</sentence><sentence id="2789">He got us a piece of soap once in awhile.</sentence><sentence id="2790">He he helped people.</sentence><sentence id="2791">He moved people from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to -- he did a whole lot probably that I don't even know about.</sentence><sentence id="2792">And then the Germans shifted him to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because there were big battles going on in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and they needed psychiatrists -- some people to help.</sentence><sentence id="2793">And in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and once -- once he got there, the situation was so disastrous that he was supposed to tell the soldiers it was worthwhile fighting for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2794">It was worthwhile fighting.</sentence><sentence id="2795">And he saw -- he couldn't do that It was idiotic.</sentence><sentence id="2796">It was ridiculous to fight.</sentence><sentence id="2797">And one of the lucky things, then -- more or less, lucky -- was terrible for him -- was that they needed surgeons worse than they needed psychiatrists in the end you know.</sentence><sentence id="2798">And he was made to work sewing up these left over pieces of flesh and he absolutely lost his mind.</sentence><sentence id="2799">He just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2800">That was not his nature.</sentence><sentence id="2801">He couldn't stand -- stand it.</sentence><sentence id="2802">And so toward V-J day, he had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat</span> -- little thing, you know, that they had the one -- for one person like bug, they used to call little bug, and he got in it and he -- he rode.</sentence><sentence id="2803">He got to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and there were Germans there and they painted big white zeros, circles on -- on all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that went through.</sentence><sentence id="2804">So Akmier said to himself that doesn't look too good, you know, why should I have a mark like that on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2805">And he went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he washed off the zero -- the -- the -- and he drove on and he heard shooting and he saw a whole 9 lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with big white zeros and there were men and women standing up against the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> being shot, one after the other.</sentence><sentence id="2806">Deserters.</sentence><sentence id="2807">Shooting the deserters!</sentence><sentence id="2808">He didn't have a zero on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and he made to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2809">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, he called the underground and the underground -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> had broken down so he had to walk a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2810">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> the -- the underground brought him a suit, took his and buried it -- his uniform and buried it, and took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and hid him.</sentence><sentence id="2811">And Akmier did a little bit of work, but not too much then because he could -- what could he do, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2812">He was, himself, endangered.</sentence><sentence id="2813">And -- and then after the wa, Akmier stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2814">He got this -- you know, the Queen said he was a guy and he could stay -- a good German, and he was -- he was really very marvelous.</sentence><sentence id="2815">But he had a lot of damage done to his physic during the war, and he never, you know, he just -- he was a psychiatrist and just -- just by himself you know.</sentence><sentence id="2816">He didn't -- he worked as a psychiatrist, but not -- he doesn't share.</sentence><sentence id="2817">He doesn't -- I often I always asked him, you know, "Don't you share with others?</sentence><sentence id="2818">Don't you discuss your cases with others, don't you?" "</sentence><sentence id="2819">Uh- huh."</sentence><sentence id="2820">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2821">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2822">Just sit.</sentence><sentence id="2823">And</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2884">Q: You and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Akmier</span> became involved.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2886">A: We became very involved, but in the end I decided to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> anyway.</sentence><sentence id="2887">No, I -- I wanted children and Akmier did not want children.</sentence><sentence id="2888">He said, "This is not a world" -- this is one of the things that was done to him.</sentence><sentence id="2889">I mean, what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="2890">He couldn't get passed it, shall we say.</sentence><sentence id="2891">He said this is not a world for -- for any children.</sentence><sentence id="2892">And he ended up marrying a woman who already had a child and couldn't have anymore.</sentence><sentence id="2893">I mean he really looked for somebody like that and he found somebody who was divorced and had the kind of blood disease that she couldn't have any more children then.</sentence><sentence id="2894">He -- he -- it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="2895">It really was so sad.</sentence><sentence id="2896">And he -- he had such talent.</sentence><sentence id="2897">You know, he played the violin, and he was very well educated.</sentence><sentence id="2898">His father was an incredible person.</sentence><sentence id="2899">His father -- there were three sons.</sentence><sentence id="2900">Now let me just say that because you have to hear something good about Germans. ____</sentence><sentence id="2901">His father was the headmaster of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and when this all came about and Hitler came up -- his father called his three sons and he said, "There's only one God."</sentence><sentence id="2902">They were all Catholic. "</sentence><sentence id="2903">There's only one God and he is not on this <span class="NPIP">earth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2904">And there is only one law, and it's God's law."</sentence><sentence id="2905">That's what his father said.</sentence><sentence id="2906">And all the boys were terrific.</sentence><sentence id="2907">I mean two of them did go to the front, but they all survived.</sentence><sentence id="2908">But I mean there are people like that.</sentence><sentence id="2909">And he lost his job.</sentence><sentence id="2910">The father was thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="2911">Right?</sentence><sentence id="2912">But they needed teachers so bad, he ended up teaching, just plain old teaching then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2940">Q: Come back to you.</sentence><sentence id="2941">The war's end is approaching.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2944">A: The war's ending.</sentence><sentence id="2945">The war's ending, and people are showing up.</sentence><sentence id="2946">People come popping out of the <span class="DLF">woodwork</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2947">My cousin, Ava comes back.</sentence><sentence id="2948">She says, "Here I am."</sentence><sentence id="2949">And she told me they were all -- my cousins -- you know, I started learning who was alive and who was dead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2956">Q: Tell us -- tell us about the day of liberation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2958">A: Well, you know that was a day -- we knew -- there was a terrible thing that happened at the 0 last.</sentence><sentence id="2959">You might have already have heard about that where the underground had been able to absolutely -- and was not able to do anything because it -- you know -- it -- and they were so frustrated.</sentence><sentence id="2960">I mean they did do things like shoot a soldier -- shoot -- shoot somebody, you know, or -- or blow up some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2961">I -- I guess they did some things like that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2962">But they had all these weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2963">And they hadn't been able to get their hands on the Germans, and they really wanted that.</sentence><sentence id="2964">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, you know, we knew the -- the Canadians were coming and -- and everybody went <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> to the Dom, which is the big place in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2965">And on the <span class="DLF">Dam</span> also was the German officer's Club, right -- I mean the Palace of the Queen is, shall we say, to the north and officer's club just a little <span class="DLF">street</span> apart, maybe 10 feet, 12 feet.</sentence><sentence id="2966">There was the German Officers Club.</sentence><sentence id="2967">And who was in this <span class="BUILDING">club</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2968">Old guys and boys of 15!</sentence><sentence id="2969">I mean really the Germans had nobody left that, so the -- some how somebody had a big shotgun in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Palace</span> -- the underground had a big shotgun and shot into the club.</sentence><sentence id="2970">And, of course, the Germans then had to fight and I think since there were so many people standing right there in the Dom, I think 147 people died -- and -- and I -- many Germans died.</sentence><sentence id="2971">I mean it was totally useless.</sentence><sentence id="2972">It was one of those things that happened in total confusion and fear on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>, fear and loathing on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>, and just a horrible, stupid, awful thing.</sentence><sentence id="2973">Well, during that period we were getting sort of ready.</sentence><sentence id="2974">You knew you could already go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2975">You knew you didn't have to be as afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2976">And they were coming.</sentence><sentence id="2977">And they did come.</sentence><sentence id="2978">They came.</sentence><sentence id="2979">And I remember looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> coming and full of these healthy pink and blond and blue and black-eyed guys.</sentence><sentence id="2980">I -- I thought our -- our guys were great looking, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2981">I'd never seen so much flesh.</sentence><sentence id="2982">I mean it was incredible.</sentence><sentence id="2983">And, of course, we went out there and screamed.</sentence><sentence id="2984">We just screamed.</sentence><sentence id="2985">And all my dance buddies, you know, my ballet -- my friends, they all -- I heard all of them -- they all had boyfriends.</sentence><sentence id="2986">They all got boyfriends, and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="2987">I, of course, had a friend and I did not.</sentence><sentence id="2988">I had always been scared to death of any kind of soldiers, so I never had anything to do with any kind of soldier.</sentence><sentence id="2989">Anyway, gun carrying, uniformed person.</sentence><sentence id="2990">It was awful.</sentence><sentence id="2991">It was -- I mean it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2992">It was <span class="NPIP">heavenly</span>, and it was scary.</sentence><sentence id="2993">Very, very scary!</sentence><sentence id="2994">Because I didn't really know where I belonged then, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2995">I knew I had -- I had immediately withdrawn because I got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ballet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2996">The ballet 1945 was started right then.</sentence><sentence id="2997">It had already been started for a whole month before that, and we had rehearsed to get ready for -- for the ballet.</sentence><sentence id="2998">But then it really started and I started to work nearly immediately after the war was over in the Ballet 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2999">Then later we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, Ballet Company, grew out of that.</sentence><sentence id="3000">And then they had a festival, a wonderful festival.</sentence><sentence id="3001">And, of course, there were no lights.</sentence><sentence id="3002">There was not yet any electricity.</sentence><sentence id="3003">By that time we had to go down and get water to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> in buckets between three and five, you get -- got assigned periods where you get water in buckets and we were pretty starved.</sentence><sentence id="3004">I mean during that we ate from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fox kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3005">We ate bulbs flower bulbs, soup made out of flower bulbs and we ate -- well, whatever the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> came up with, that's what we ate.</sentence><sentence id="3006">You know, you had three little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pots</span> and one of you had to go and get it.</sentence><sentence id="3007">And the amazing thing was that the formerly poor people complained much more than the people who formerly had money.</sentence><sentence id="3008">It was very, very funny.</sentence><sentence id="3009">And the articles in the paper were a riot.</sentence><sentence id="3010">But hunger was not funny.</sentence><sentence id="3011">And we would go up and get up in the morning and have -- have a ship's cracker, you know, one of these hard tack things, and we haven't -- hadn't had any butter or fat for so long that we were freezing to death.</sentence><sentence id="3012">I was always cold.</sentence><sentence id="3013">I was -- and this is still one of my greatest fear.</sentence><sentence id="3014">I can stand hunger better 1 than cold.</sentence><sentence id="3015">It was terribly cold.</sentence><sentence id="3016">We would take -- there was six of us or seven of us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- we would go all in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and put everybody's blankets and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on top of us and we still were cold, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3017">And eat a hard tack before getting up, and then only cold water to wash with.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And, of course, after -- right after -- oh, we had no coal to heat -- heat the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, which by the way was the only thing to cook on.</sentence><sentence id="3019">Remember gas wasn't there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3020">So we got -- Monfred had a big __ he got a lot of peach from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and -- and we brought -- we had a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> full of peat.</sentence><sentence id="3021">And we used the peat to -- to cook on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> which was just a little heating, which also heated the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3022">And that peat was full of fleas and we had a flea plague on top of the cold and the hunger.</sentence><sentence id="3023">And one night I caught 84 fleas.</sentence><sentence id="3024">I killed 84 fleas.</sentence><sentence id="3025">1 mean we were covered, and actually we didn't get rid of it til the Americans gave us some DDT, which was brand new then.</sentence><sentence id="3026">I mean I don't think there even.</sentence><sentence id="3027">I mean it was just in total disaster.</sentence><sentence id="3028">We were hungry, cold, and full of fleas by the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3029">It was outrageous.</sentence><sentence id="3030">And then there was this wonderful festival where they made fires everywhere and they had -- I don't know where they got lights, but at night we had lights and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> were laid across the <span class="DLF">canals</span> and you could walk from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> from one __ to the other just over -- over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3031">I was in love.</sentence><sentence id="3032">And it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="3033">It was the most wonderful -- wonderful day in my -- I can ever remember.</sentence><sentence id="3034">And I didn't think -- I didn't let myself think about my parents and my -- for that one day.</sentence><sentence id="3035">And then afterwards, I said, "Now what?</sentence><sentence id="3036">Now what?"</sentence><sentence id="3037">And then we started hearing that -- oh, they are lists.</sentence><sentence id="3038">They are lists of people who were coming back, and your mother is on one of the lists.</sentence><sentence id="3039">Well, Monfred said to me then, "Don't believe it."</sentence><sentence id="3040">And I -- I already hated him with a passion.</sentence><sentence id="3041">Right?</sentence><sentence id="3042">Because he had done all these horrible things.</sentence><sentence id="3043">And he said, "Don't believe it."</sentence><sentence id="3044">And I said, "I'm going to believe it."</sentence><sentence id="3045">We then knew -- we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3046">In "45.So I started going to the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3047">And, of course, I stood there.</sentence><sentence id="3048">When I had the time, I stood there and I stood there and I stood there.</sentence><sentence id="3049">I asked -- and when I see these films, you know, they are films made by the French.</sentence><sentence id="3050">They were wonderful French films, but and -- and they're these people going to -- other people coming out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, you know, and they have their shaved and they looked awful and there are these people coming back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and you ask -- that's how it was -- and you asked, did you know so and so?</sentence><sentence id="3051">Did you know so and son?</sentence><sentence id="3052">No.</sentence><sentence id="3053">No.</sentence><sentence id="3054">No.</sentence><sentence id="3055">Now I think that one of those people was somebody took my mother's name to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3056">I'm sure of it.</sentence><sentence id="3057">And recently somebody showed up with my sister's name.</sentence><sentence id="3058">And, of course, when I started looking, she was gone.</sentence><sentence id="3059">I mean there was nobody to find.</sentence><sentence id="3060">And it's the same sort of thing and then I started waving goodbye to people.</sentence><sentence id="3061">I had girlfriends who met Americans and who married them.</sentence><sentence id="3062">And I started seeing people who were not good and women who were not good in the war.</sentence><sentence id="3063">And I was waving goodbye to them because they were marrying American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="3064">What do the American soldiers know?They know nothing!</sentence><sentence id="3065">And if they had known, what would it have mattered?</sentence><sentence id="3066">They were in love.</sentence><sentence id="3067">You know, such
