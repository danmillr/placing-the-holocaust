<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">Q. Dr. Riegner, would you tell us your full name, and where and when you were born?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2">A. My name is Gerhart Riegner.</sentence><sentence id="3">Second name is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moritz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was named after my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="5">I am born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I am a real Berliner, as Kennedy would have said.</sentence><sentence id="7">And I am born on the 12th of September, 1911.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="8">Q. And could you tell us a little bit about what your life was like when you were growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> with your family, friends, the climate, so forth?\ A. Well, I come from a typical German Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="9">And I would say that we belonged already -- as Kurt Blumenfeld would have said -- to the post-assimilationist era.</sentence><sentence id="10">It is typical that I am born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and that my two parents were also already born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">My grandparents came from very typical German middle-sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">One grandfather was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="13">The other -- my grandmother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">The second grandmother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.5219" long="13.2918">Neubrandenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">And the other grandfather -- here we come already to the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederschlesien</span>, which is <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>, the more German part of it.</sentence><sentence id="16">So 1am coming from a long stock German family.</sentence><sentence id="17">We had in the family two traditions.</sentence><sentence id="18">On the one hand, a very Jewish tradition.</sentence><sentence id="19">My grandmother, my mother's side, was a Lewandovsky.</sentence><sentence id="20">She was a niece of Louis Lewandovsky, who was the creator of the modern synagogue music, and some of the most beautiful modern melodies originate from him.</sentence><sentence id="21">His son-in-law was the famous philosopher, Hermann Cohen, the founder of the Marburgerschule of the school of Neo-Kantianism.</sentence><sentence id="22">He was</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="26">one of the few full professors under the Kaiserreich in the old style.</sentence><sentence id="27">He came from very Jewish origins.</sentence><sentence id="28">He studied the Talmud.</sentence><sentence id="29">He went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theological seminary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> before he became a philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="30">And he is the author not only of great works and the reinterpretation of Kant, but also of religious philosophy, of work in religious philosophy, based on the sources of Judaism, "die Religion der Vernunft."</sentence><sentence id="31">This is a great man in my family, whom I knew as a child.</sentence><sentence id="32">And where -- every Sunday we went for lunch to my grandparents" andfor coffee or tea to Cohen's.</sentence><sentence id="33">And in <span class="BUILDING">Cohen's house</span>, which was very near that of my grandparents", every Sunday there was a great party, sixty, fifty, sixty persons.</sentence><sentence id="34">And the old man was nearly blind, was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rocking chair</span>, like Kennedy, with white, wonderful white hair, and the blue dark glasses, was presiding over -- what should I call it?</sentence><sentence id="35">Holding <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, if you want.</sentence><sentence id="36">He was really nice to us children.</sentence><sentence id="37">He played with us, and -- but before all, I knew that he was an important man.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">I see him still in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on -- Simchas Torah.</sentence><sentence id="39">01:10 In 1917, I was six years old, when he walked directly behind the rabbi with the little Torah, very light because he was not so very strong any more.</sentence><sentence id="40">And he looked like an old Jewish prophet, with his fantastic great face, his white locks, and he gave the impression of a real leader of a religious movement.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="41">Q. But you knew he was also an important man in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in terms of his academic standing?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="42">A. He was fighting anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="43">And he spoke out from 1879, when the famous attacks by Treitschke, the historian, and Stoecke, the priest and the official Dompraediger of the empire, attacked the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="44">And he was himself, by the way, the victim of many anti-Semitic attacks, and was -- had never a call from another <span class="BUILDING">university</span> -- this is also very interesting -- and was fighting</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="48">for his pupils to get appointed as professors, and had one defeat after the other in this respect.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="49">Even a man like Ernst Gerschieler, as great as his name was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- was his most important pupil probably -- couldn't get in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marburg</span>, the Privatdozenten, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="50">Now, this is the one -- and here, the one source of my Jewish background which was perhaps in myself stronger than in the family itself.</sentence><sentence id="51">And this was due to the general climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">My first anti-Semitic experience was on the second day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1917, and somebody called me "ein dreckiger Judenluemmel," dirty Jew boy -- something.</sentence><sentence id="53">And I -- this was my first anti-Semitic experience.</sentence><sentence id="54">And I reacted immediately, not very intelligently.</sentence><sentence id="55">But I couldn't not react.</sentence><sentence id="56">And I replied "dreckiger Christenbengel," which wasn't very intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="57">But I did not accept the attack.</sentence><sentence id="58">My second experience was an experience of social anti-Semitism, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, when a good friend of mine, who was also a son of a lawyer, never succeeded in inviting me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="59">Q. You mean he tried, but his parents wouldn't allow it?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="60">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="61">It was a tragedy with which I fought three years, each time finding another excuse why they didn't invite me, until I finally understood why.</sentence><sentence id="62">Now, all this happened in a <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in which there was a strong anti-Semitic movement.</sentence><sentence id="63">I come to it in a moment when I speak about the political background.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="64">Q. Allright.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="68">A. But I remember, for instance, the day on which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rathenau</span> was assassinated, in 1922.</sentence><sentence id="69">I was not yet eleven years old.</sentence><sentence id="70">And I remember the day my mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and we visited her.</sentence><sentence id="71">She had some operation -- I don't remember what it was -- and it shook us to the foundations.</sentence><sentence id="72">This was the great German Jewish patriot, who, in 1918, at the end of the war, was the only one to suggest that the war was lost "Levee en masse" -- the popular resistance movement -- a Jew who had the courage to do this -- was the organizer of the whole economic administration of raw materials during the four years of the first World War, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">A really great German patriot, no doubt about it, who had immense merit, from the German point of view -- Q. He was a very able man.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="74">A. -- to have organized it.</sentence><sentence id="75">And he was, as a minister of foreign affairs, killed by "voelkische," racist people.</sentence><sentence id="76">I will never forget this.</sentence><sentence id="77">This -- and in this whole -- this whole movement, there were at least three, four, five others -- I am not speaking even of Hitler -- the first revolt in 1924.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">But in every election we had it, and you felt it, and you saw it, and we were very noisy.</sentence><sentence id="79">Now I come to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">My family was very interested in politics.</sentence><sentence id="81">My father was associated since 1910 with a member -- the socialist member, a prominent socialist who became a member of the Reichstag, who was during the revolution in 1918 a member of the provisional Prussian government, minister of justice, and who became one of the great fighters against the death penalty in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="82">Q. Kurt Rosenfeld?</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="86">A. Kurt Rosenfeld, yes.</sentence><sentence id="87">My father was not a socialist.</sentence><sentence id="88">My father was a very socially minded democrat.</sentence><sentence id="89">Perhaps more social than the Socialist Party, deeply -- but didn't believe in Marxism, and so on, but he had a very great social conscienceness.</sentence><sentence id="90">He was a typical product of his time, where the idea of "allgemeine Bildung," universal knowledge, universal education, was the great idea towards which a great part of German Jewry attended.</sentence><sentence id="91">He was very close to Cohen, who considered him as his preferred nephew, who had no children, and, therefore, the close relationship.</sentence><sentence id="92">He was in reality very knowledgeable in German literature.</sentence><sentence id="93">When he died, I heard him -- and the last time I saw him and -- lying on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- declaiming for hours verses from Goethe's Faust, from Heine's "Lieder," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="94">You know, this is human.</sentence><sentence id="95">At the end of the life, the souvenirs of the young years come out very, very strongly -- that remain, years full of German "Bildung."</sentence><sentence id="96">He was a great connoisseur of art.</sentence><sentence id="97">In his old years he even wrote books on art and articles.</sentence><sentence id="98">Where he didn't succeed to write about European art -- to publish it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I gave him the idea to write for a -- European publications about American art, and he published a series of modern American art.</sentence><sentence id="99">It was very appreciated.</sentence><sentence id="100">He was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in many ways in many <span class="DLF">fields</span> of human knowledge and endeavors.</sentence><sentence id="101">As I said, he was a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="102">And he was even very esteemed amongst his colleagues.</sentence><sentence id="103">He was what is called a member -- elected as a member of the "Vorstand der Anwaltskammer," which is the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> of lawyers, where all the lawyers elect their own disciplinary courts and instances.</sentence><sentence id="104">And he got in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> the largest number of votes amongst the lawyers, which -- for a man who was very modest -- and so this was quite remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="105">My mother was also active in politics.</sentence><sentence id="106">She became active in education of women and information of women as citizens of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">She gave lectures and courses to -- in <span class="BUILDING">women's schools</span> about the responsibility, civil responsibility of women.</sentence><sentence id="108">She became a very</sentence></p><p><sentence id="111">active member of the Democratic Party and belonged to the enlarged Bureau of the party, went out taking -- making speeches at all elections, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="112">So you see here, there was a political atmosphere, both from my parents and from associates of my father.</sentence><sentence id="113">This was the other <span class="NPIP">part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">I was deeply interested in politics all my life.</sentence><sentence id="115">And I saw the disappearance, slow disappearance of the democratic republic.</sentence><sentence id="116">I had mentioned today when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rathenau</span> was assassinated.</sentence><sentence id="117">I remember the day when the first president of the <span class="COUNTRY">republic</span> died.</sentence><sentence id="118">I took part in the 1925 -- I think, in the funeral in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lustgarten</span> with the hundreds of thousands of people.</sentence><sentence id="119">And I felt already then somehow instinctive whether we hadn't already buried the republic there.</sentence><sentence id="120">And all the more when Hindenburg, to our great disappointment, was elected president.</sentence><sentence id="121">And -- which was, of course, a terrible regressive step from the point of view of democracy.</sentence><sentence id="122">This all I lived very intensely and followed very intensely.</sentence><sentence id="123">And I saw with growing fear what was happening, and the great uccess of the racist and Nazi movements.</sentence><sentence id="124">I finished my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1929 with a very good examination.</sentence><sentence id="125">I went my first term -- I followed in the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> im Breisgau -- was my first being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and on my own.</sentence><sentence id="126">I continued in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">I went again the next summer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, which was perhaps the greatest experience in my <span class="BUILDING">university</span> life.</sentence><sentence id="128">This was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> of -- where people teaching, like Jaspers and Anschutz and Ratbur and Gundolf, and -- you name it, Tibelius.</sentence><sentence id="129">This was really the summit of German intellectual life, and it marked me very much.</sentence><sentence id="130">Even if I have been forced to separate slowly from the identification with the German people -- and you were, by the rejection which you felt -- always more separating yourselves from this milieu, from this concept of belonging to the German people.</sentence><sentence id="131">This was, in any case, one of the great culminating points of my life, which I will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="132">And I owe very much to this cultural activity, to this expression of German culture, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">I am not speaking of the other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="134"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> at that time, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span></sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="138">Republic, was an enormously cultivated life, <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, opera -- I took part in all this fully, and I belonged to the Volksbuehne subscribers.</sentence><sentence id="139">I saw the most modern <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, plays, and so on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="140">But I was very conscious about -- as I said, about the going-down of the republic.</sentence><sentence id="141">When I was a student, I joined the Association of the Republican Students.</sentence><sentence id="142">And this was not an accident.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="143">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span>, where both the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> were located, there were still student elections.</sentence><sentence id="144">In <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, these elections for the student representation at <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> had already been suppressed because the Nazis had gained large majorities all over.</sentence><sentence id="145">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> it was still allowed.</sentence><sentence id="146">And I took part in the student elections in my first term, in my third term, made speeches, organized, cooperated at that time with people -- very interesting people.</sentence><sentence id="147">Our patron was an old German professor, von <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schuelze-Gevanitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">His son was later a consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> -- very important consul, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="149">Schuelze-Gevenitz was an economist, a sociologist, a very wonderful human being.</sentence><sentence id="150">And one of the students with whom I cooperated then was a man who became very famous, had a very sad life, was Schulze Baeusen.</sentence><sentence id="151">He had just joined the democratic movement, coming from the Jungdeutsche Orden.</sentence><sentence id="152">He ended as a Communist, was one of the founders of the <span class="BUILDING">Rote Kapelle</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">Red Chapel</span>, which he organized from the minister of defense residence.</sentence><sentence id="153">A fantastic fellow, I must say.</sentence><sentence id="154">We worked together in the elections in 1929.</sentence><sentence id="155">I would never have expected that he would go so far to the right and to be so true to his ideals.</sentence><sentence id="156">Anyhow, you see that I was involved in this.</sentence><sentence id="157">I was also involved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">But there -- this was 1930.</sentence><sentence id="159">There I already separated somehow and visited regularly the Zionist groups.</sentence><sentence id="160">I never joined the Zionist student groups, but I had many friends there, and even raveled on some of their excursions, winter excursions in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">I joined them, was skiing with them together.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I was very much attracted by the Zionist --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="165">Q. Let me interrupt for a second.</sentence><sentence id="166">Would it be fair to say that as of roughly this time, near 1930, you are still balancing in your mind the dual loyalty of being German and Jewish and trying to figure out for yourself what are the problems and where does one have to come down?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="167">A. Well, I came certainly -- I started certainly as a conscious German, but deeply offended as a Jew by what happened to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="168">And was struggling first to defend it from <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and then I saw more and more that this didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="169">And so my way of retreating from identification with the German nation became more and more clear.</sentence><sentence id="170">I think this is as far as I can get it, but I think this is the right description.</sentence><sentence id="171">And when I finished my studies -- by the way, I would say that here, also, I am far from being only a jurist, only legacy.</sentence><sentence id="172">I was deeply involved in all kinds of other things.</sentence><sentence id="173">I followed especially the historians, Ongden, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">I followed philosophers, Jaspers, Spengler, was deeply involved in all kinds of other art, history, and so on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="175">The ideal of universal Bildung, which I learned, so to speak, with the milk of my mother -- in the family, it was deeply working on me.</sentence><sentence id="176">And I took it over from my father, from my parents.</sentence><sentence id="177">And I was never one-sided.</sentence><sentence id="178">Even in my whole Jewish career, you will find in my <span class="BUILDING">library</span> sections on philosophy and history and on economy and you name it.</sentence><sentence id="179">And I used my <span class="BUILDING">university</span> years to the full to get involved and educated in many other <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">Now, I finished my studies with the so-called "Referendar" Exam.</sentence><sentence id="181">This is the first great examination after three, three and a half years of study.</sentence><sentence id="182">And I got a very good result, and was then named in the first days of 1933 as "Referendar," which is a kind of assistant to a judge, if you want.</sentence><sentence id="183">It's really the practical years, where you use what you have learned in a practical way.</sentence><sentence id="184">You spend time at different <span class="BUILDING">tribunals</span> at various degrees in the administration, and as a lawyer, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="185">And I was in the first stage of this.</sentence><sentence id="186">I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Amtsgericht</span> Weding.</sentence><sentence id="187">It's the largest tribunal of the first instance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="191">And I wrote the judgments for the judge, which he signed.</sentence><sentence id="192">And active in all kinds of legal assistance, and so on, wrote what was asked for in this position.</sentence><sentence id="193">Then came Hitler to power the 30th of January, 1933.</sentence><sentence id="194">And this, of course, gave us a terrible shock.</sentence><sentence id="195">All the more -- Q. You did not expect it?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">A. Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="197">But here I would say, in the November elections, "32, you know, during that year, we had -- I don't know -- three, four elections.</sentence><sentence id="198">In the November elections the Nazi party for the first time had lost more than a million of votes.</sentence><sentence id="199">And it looked at that moment that it was not absolutely necessary.</sentence><sentence id="200">And the whole thing that he got into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> as chancellor was an intrigue started by the people around the president, Hindenburg, because of some of the scandals in the <span class="REGION">eastern Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And then Papen and the other reactionary politicians combined in order, in a great miscalculation, to bring about the coalition between the Deutsch Nationale Volkspartei and the Nazi parties, believing that they would dominate Hitler, which was, of course, ridiculous from the point of view of political judgment.</sentence><sentence id="202">When Hitler came to power, I was very soon convinced that this was a decisive point in the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I was very soon convinced that they would not give up power, and that this would lead to terrible persecutions for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="203">I was a little -- we come back to this -- a number of these Nazi manifestations, and so on, on the 30th of January, when he took power, and the Ist of April, and the Boycott, and so on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="204">And I decided to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">We were under an illusion.</sentence><sentence id="206">We didn't know the <span class="NPIP">world outside</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="207">We didn't realize how deeply the economic crisis had worked.</sentence><sentence id="208">We thought that first the younger generation should get out and then the older should follow.</sentence><sentence id="209">But the chance to build up a new</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="213">0 existence for the younger generation was practically nil.</sentence><sentence id="214">I would have liked to go then to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">The Zionist ideal, as I already said, worked very strongly on me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">Q. Excuse me a second.</sentence><sentence id="217">Were there any specific events that precipitated your decision to leave, or was this just your general impression after Hitler had taken power -- A. Well, I think it was the general understanding of what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="218">Practically -- I will just give you an example.</sentence><sentence id="219">On the Ist of April, when I was suspended as "Referendar," as the functionary of the tribunal, the same day my father was suspended as a lawyer, the same day my older sister, who was a teacher at the <span class="BUILDING">Lycee</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.1259073567769" long="8.65818761080501">Frankfurt am Main</span>, was suspended as a teacher, my youngest sister, who was still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, was thrown out from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">So out of a family of five -- my mother didn't exercise any profession as she was a good housewife at the time.</sentence><sentence id="221">She was a teacher by profession, and she took on again after my father didn't earn any money any more.</sentence><sentence id="222">She became again a teacher in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and was teaching then.</sentence><sentence id="223">The existence of four of five of our family was completely put upside down.</sentence><sentence id="224">This was -- but this accompanied my reason.</sentence><sentence id="225">Of course, if 1 wouldn't have been thrown out the Ist of April, maybe I would have taken longer to decide.</sentence><sentence id="226">Although I was only suspended, and I could have waited.</sentence><sentence id="227">But I knew this was a definite throwing-out.</sentence><sentence id="228">So I didn't wait.</sentence><sentence id="229">I waited a little bit, because on the same Ist of April, in the evening, there was a -- we had rented a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> because my father was not in good health at the time and the doctors had

tried.</sentence><sentence id="609">And while today, even a young youth doesn't understand it, this opposition, and the denouncing of the people who had the courage to stand up and preach for the

for the <span class="BUILDING">Geneva office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">And very interesting: There was great opposition.</sentence><sentence id="614">All the people with whom I became very friendly later, other Jews -- the opposition was, "But he doesn't speak Yiddish."</sentence><sentence id="615">And Nahum Goldman apparently -- I wasn't at the meeting.</sentence><sentence id="616">I was told later -- he said, "Well, I need him at the League of Nations.</sentence><sentence id="617">There they don't speak Yiddish, either.</sentence><sentence id="618">They speak French.</sentence><sentence id="619">They speak English.</sentence><sentence id="620">And this he does."</sentence><sentence id="621">But this didn't make any -- any -- any impression -- and then the only German Jew who was there in the new, elected executive was Georg Bernhardt.</sentence><sentence id="622">Georg Bernhardt was a former member of the Reichstag, editor-in-chief of the Voelkischer Zeitung, which was one of the great German, liberal newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="623">He was a professor at the <span class="BUILDING">high commercial school</span>, a <span

the uncontested president of the German Jewish immigrant society.</sentence><sentence id="626">And he stood up, and said -- as I was told later -- he said, "But he comes from a very, very, very good Jewish family."</sentence><sentence id="627">Now, that did it.</sentence><sentence id="628">There was no argument.</sentence><sentence id="629">Yiddish you can learn, but a good family, you can't -- you must have, or you don't have.</sentence><sentence id="630">And apparently this convinced the people.</sentence><sentence id="631">Very funny, but so it happened.</sentence><sentence id="632">So I entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the 1st of September, I think, 1936, in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> which didn't exist really, which I had to create.</sentence><sentence id="633">And with no budget, with a lot of debts.</sentence><sentence id="634">And instead</sentence></p><p><sentence id="637">6 the salary which I got was just a hundred francs more than I had as a student -- postgraduate student without having any obligations.</sentence><sentence id="638">And not only this, but all these great problems, financial problems, and -- and came the end of the month, I had sometimes to advance the money for the secretary, and the postage, and so on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="639">And this hasn't changed.</sentence><sentence id="640">It has only grown in figures.</sentence><sentence id="641">They were smaller amounts, and now it's much higher amounts.</sentence><sentence id="642">And so I came in.</sentence><sentence id="643">And -- but in reality, when -- while I was selected because of my legal knowledge, and so on, I was involved in the whole movement immediately, and I took as much part in the anti-German fight as in anything else.</sentence><sentence id="644">And I must say, I said I didn't regret the fifty-five years.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="645">But there is, of course, tne factor, also, which I should mention.</sentence><sentence id="646">Nahum Goldman was a fantastic chief, generous and -- as I said, he saw the essential.</sentence><sentence id="647">He did leave you enormous freedom.</sentence><sentence id="648">He discussed with you the <span class="DLF">line</span>, but not every comma and point.</sentence><sentence id="649">He would discuss with you the general ideas.</sentence><sentence id="650">He would agree with you.</sentence><sentence id="651">He would make here and there a comment, "Perhaps this is too strong," "Perhaps this is too weak."</sentence><sentence id="652">And he would leave it to you.</sentence><sentence id="653">And he would leave you an enormous amount of freedom in the execution of your function and give you the feeling of participation.</sentence><sentence id="654">He never considered me as an employee.</sentence><sentence id="655">There was always the feeling of equality.</sentence><sentence id="656">He gave in the -- and I was what? --</sentence><sentence id="657">about twenty-five years secretary general, first coordinator, and secretary general of the Congress.</sentence><sentence id="658">I gave the staff, the higher staff a position of codecision in the Congress.</sentence><sentence id="659">And because they knew, because they were underpaid, because they had something to contribute, and they shouldn't take the layman's opinion.</sentence><sentence id="660">They should contribute to it, and there should be codecision.</sentence><sentence id="661">And Nahum Goldman understood this very well.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="662">And this, of course, facilitated enormously my work.</sentence><sentence id="663">I really felt that I have contributed.</sentence><sentence id="664">Many things which have gone under the name of Goldman came in fact from me.</sentence><sentence id="665">I never resented that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="666">We were working on a joint project, a joint work.</sentence><sentence id="667">And, therefore, this fact.</sentence><sentence id="668">I am not saying that</sentence></p><p><sentence id="671">7 I hadn't a complaint.</sentence><sentence id="672">A complaint was, on the one hand, we were all very badly paid.</sentence><sentence id="673">We are really idealistic workers, but we didn't -- I often said -- once Israel Sieff, the great philanthropist, the Zionist in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, said to me, "You could become any moment administrator director of one of my 122 <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>."</sentence><sentence id="674">I said to him, "This is very nice, the nicest thing."</sentence><sentence id="675">These <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, each of them, had more than a million pounds -- how do you say?</sentence><sentence id="676">--Umsatz -- turnover, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="677">So there -- at the time, I think 132 million pounds, which was not bad.</sentence><sentence id="678">And I said, "<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, it's very nice what you said to me.</sentence><sentence id="679">It's perhaps the nicest thing.</sentence><sentence id="680">But if I wanted to make money, I would have become a banker, not a secretary of the World Jewish Congress."</sentence><sentence id="681">And this is it.</sentence><sentence id="682">This was real idealism.</sentence><sentence id="683">And I include practically all my colleagues in this.</sentence><sentence id="684">We all worked for the cause, not for the money.</sentence><sentence id="685">And we were deeply involved in the cause.</sentence><sentence id="686">We lived it and we developed it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="687">It didn't exist as a scheme.</sentence><sentence id="688">And this was, of course, very attractive, and, therefore, I stayed.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="689">Q. Things must have changed rather radically for you when the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="690">I mean, here you were -- you were hired partly because of your legal expertise, your international legal problems.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="691">A. Yeah.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="692">Q. Now there was no legality.</sentence><sentence id="693">There was no effective League of Nations.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="694">A.

id="830">And he said, "And you can look at it."</sentence><sentence id="831">And he stops before a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, takes out the mail from one of the boites postales, the boxes, and puts it in his pocket and takes out of his pocket another from the day before.</sentence><sentence id="832">And so he did that two or three <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="833">These were German officials, I think, journalists and officials at the <span class="BUILDING">international labor office</span>, who were controlled by the French secret

you.</sentence><sentence id="839">And became always less gemuetlich.</sentence><sentence id="840">Now, so we moved in this <span class="DLF">field</span> slowly from one to the -- then, of course, when terrible things happened, we organized ourselves to be involved and to be able to report.</sentence><sentence id="841">There were no direct communications of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="842">So we kept the relations, the correspondence with the Jewish community as long as we could.</sentence><sentence id="843">We subscribed to all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish newspapers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="844">I subscribed to all the official gazettes.</sentence><sentence id="845">I had I think twenty-three official gazettes, which regularly -- you can see them I think now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">I gave it to Yad Vashem, or the <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> gave it to Yad Vashem.</sentence><sentence id="847">I did this for the Institute of Jewish Affairs, which since "40 was here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="848">And we translated those into one of the languages that the Jews would understand, German, or French, English.</sentence><sentence id="849">I established a whole mechanism how to get information.</sentence><sentence id="850">And I was helped by, for instance, the League of Nations library.</sentence><sentence id="851">There was a man whom I knew very well, and so on, and he helped us.</sentence><sentence id="852">He knew what we were doing and was a friend.</sentence><sentence id="853">So I could take photocopies of some of these official gazettes, and we examined them each time and we found these -- all these anti-Jewish legislations and decrees.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="857">3 And I made the files -- I don't know whether you have ever seen them -- at least of -- for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and for General Gouvernement, for Boehmen und Maehren, for <span

the League of Nations officials then with the help of the <span class="BUILDING">book shop</span>, they -- I subscribed, and I was "Monsieur Mondial," who got these -- all kinds of -- we really organized ourselves in order to be able to.</sentence><sentence id="859">And you know, you can obtain a lot of information on this.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="860">Especially -- there were -- under Slovakian file, I think there were at least 150 official decrees and communications which I had sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">They got it all.</sentence><sentence id="862">So we organized ourselves in order to be able to inform.</sentence><sentence id="863">This was certainly the most important thing.</sentence><sentence id="864">I felt -- we felt -- and I include <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span>, for instance.</sentence><sentence id="865">We felt that we were encircled, and political decisions would have to be made <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">Our judgment was not sufficiently independent.</sentence><sentence id="867">This, we accepted from that.</sentence><sentence id="868">That doesn't mean we shouldn't make proposals.</sentence><sentence id="869">We made a lot of proposals.</sentence><sentence id="870">And our judgment was often better than that of the people who were <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="871">I am not contesting that.</sentence><sentence id="872">But we never felt in these three years or four from -- Iam speaking the years from "40 on -- that the decisions had to be made in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="873">And, therefore, my most important function was to report.</sentence><sentence id="874">This was

You can't make decisions unless you have good information?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="876">A. Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="877">Yeah, sure.</sentence><sentence id="878">Now, I said, of course, we had reports from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>, and then we had reports from individuals.</sentence><sentence id="879">Some people appeared, disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="880">You know, some wonderful</sentence></p><p><sentence id="883">4 figures.</sentence><sentence id="884">There was a -- a Dutchman, he was shot later -- Nijkeirk, wonderful man.</sentence><sentence id="885">He was a young Dutch who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and organized the Jewish youth and tried to -- you may have heard the name.</sentence><sentence id="886">Maybe it's not on there.</sentence><sentence id="887">He was later arrested and put before a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and shot.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="888">Q.

On the contrary.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="893">Q. We can talk about some of the people then, but that will have to be on the next tape.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="894">A. Yeah.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="895">Q. Maybe they will give us some lunch now.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="896">A.

Ifyou don't remember exactly when you started to get it, that's fine, but let's talk about the people who -- from whom you got information.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="902">A. Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="903">No.</sentence><sentence id="904">I spoke about this -- this Dutch Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="905">Q. Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="906">A. Which -- this is the type of persons -- I mean -- there came, of course, others, but he was one of the finest I -- remember.</sentence><sentence id="907">And he came by himself.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="908">Q. Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="909">A. Of course, he knew that we -- there was the center, and we did things.</sentence><sentence id="910">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtheim</span>, and he came to me, and -- there were all kinds of these -- there was a -- I had mentioned already Uhlmann, I think, with whom I went on vacation to save -- Q. Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="911">A. -- to save the -- the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I saved them -- you know, the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">And we came back.</sentence><sentence id="913">It was quiet and functioned.</sentence><sentence id="914">And nobody wanted to run away anymore.</sentence><sentence id="915">Now, it was a terrible morale breakdown, of course.</sentence><sentence id="916">And one couldn't blame them.</sentence><sentence id="917">This was really a world which was</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="921">6 falling to pieces.</sentence><sentence id="922">But you had to have the strength of character that -- okay, this is a volcanic eruption.</sentence><sentence id="923">We have to wait until it's over.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="924">Q. There was, after all, a real chance that <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> could have been invaded.</sentence><sentence id="925">They had considered it?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="926">A. Sure.</sentence><sentence id="927">I told you, I had the packed Rucksack.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="928">Q. Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="929">A. And [had the Bolivian passport, which I probably never could use, but anyhow -- whatever.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="930">Q. Do you want to tell us when -- (Discussion with someone off-camera.)</sentence><sentence id="931">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="932">I didn't realize.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="933">A. Now we can start.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="934">Q. We're on.</sentence><sentence id="935">Dr. Riegner, tell us more about some of the people who came in to you with information that you proceeded then to send out in your reports.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="936">A. Now, I had spoke about this Dutchman.</sentence><sentence id="937">I will give you another example.</sentence><sentence id="938">All are not so -- it's quite some time ago.</sentence><sentence id="939">And my memory is not bad, but it has also lacunae.</sentence><sentence id="940">There is another</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="944">7 one, the Dutchman -- a Danishman.</sentence><sentence id="945">You may know his name because there was recently -- a book was published about him which is -- Q. Rottenberg?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="946">A. Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rottenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="947"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rottenberg</span> -- you know, in -- extraordinary times produce extraordinary people.</sentence><sentence id="948">This I have seen time and again.</sentence><sentence id="949">Rottenberg was a Danish Jew, who suddenly appeared in our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> -- both Lichtheim and mine.</sentence><sentence id="950">We had on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">You should know the same -- in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="952">We didn't know how he came, why he came.</sentence><sentence id="953">We didn't know where he went.</sentence><sentence id="954">We found out that he had -- first of all, you are very suspicious -- a Jew, a Danish Jew who can travel in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="955">You know that you can trust him?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="956">He is aspy?</sentence><sentence id="957">Who knows?</sentence><sentence id="958">We find out -- we found out that he was somehow protected by the military establishment, defense.</sentence><sentence id="959">I was very suspicious at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="960">But the man came with highly interesting information.</sentence><sentence id="961">I definitely remember that he gave us the first information on the administration of the <span class="DLF">Reichsbahn</span>, of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German railways</span>, sending the bills for the deportation of the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="962">They asked that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> should pay for the transportation of the deportation.</sentence><sentence id="963">For me this was the height of chutzpa which the Germans had.</sentence><sentence id="964">I was absolutely flabbergasted.</sentence><sentence id="965">And I reported this, of course.</sentence><sentence id="966">The story is -- you can read it now in the book by a Danish Jew who heard me mention Rottenberg in one of my lectures at the Nahum Goldman fellowship.</sentence><sentence id="967">And I asked him afterwards, "Do you know Mr. Rottenberg?"</sentence><sentence id="968">And he, of course, never heard of him.</sentence><sentence id="969">And when he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, he inquired.</sentence><sentence id="970">The story which he has now written in the book -- it's very interesting -- that this Rottenberg was a German Jew who established himself -- I think in</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="974">8 1907, in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, became a very successful businessman, had earned a lot of money, had a big <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> and a good business, and at the end of the First World War was approached by the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span>, if he, with the big <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> he had, couldn't house provisionally some German officer who was in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="975">And they agreed to it, and the officer came to live with him, and they became very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="976">And he stayed months, several months with him.</sentence><sentence id="977">And finally, he left, and Rottenberg loaned him still some money.</sentence><sentence id="978">And then he wrote him a letter and the officer wrote him a letter of thanks, and said if ever he could do anything for him, he would do.</sentence><sentence id="979">Signed, "Goering."</sentence><sentence id="980">Now, in 1933, Rottenberg remembered this and wrote a letter to Goering, who in the meantime became Marshal -- Feld Marshall Goering, the second personality of the Reich.</sentence><sentence id="981">And Rottenberg had some family in <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> still, and he asked whether he could help him to -- to bring them out.</sentence><sentence id="982">And Goering invited him immediately to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and gave him all the permits necessary, and the permit he left -- his passports without J stamp, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="983">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rottenburg</span> must have then felt that he had some influence and tried to do certain other things for the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">I haven't been able to read all the book because it's in Danish, so I don't know the details, but I know that he was in contact with a number of Jewish personalities like Sally Meier, like Winfried Israel and Schwarz and -- all this I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="985">But I knew -- and we -- we established -- the author of this book approached me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, "Have you -- what is written in your files about him?"</sentence><sentence id="986">I told him immediately, "You will not find anything.</sentence><sentence id="987">You will not find the name.</sentence><sentence id="988">This is the type which I wouldn't put down in writing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="989">But you may find some of his stories.".</sentence><sentence id="990">And I told him the story, for instance, about this -- the bills from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Reichsbahn</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">He said, "But you have to tell me, what are the dates he visited <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="992">This I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="993">So he produced the passports, the passports of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rottenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="994">And we found the exact dates, and we looked in my files, and what</sentence></p><p><sentence id="997">9 after such dates I wrote in reports to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="998">And the story about the Reichsbahn, about the railway administration is there.</sentence><sentence id="999">Exactly after -- there is no name of "Rottenberg;" "From a very reliable source, I hear this and this and this."</sentence><sentence id="1000">And we found him several such stories.</sentence><sentence id="1001">You see, such things happened, and whether he was able to find any to say -- to help some people to get out, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1002">I cannot read the other chapters of the book.</sentence><sentence id="1003">But I take another incident.</sentence><sentence id="1004">One of the best organized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and quite courageous was the Czech community.</sentence><sentence id="1005">And we were in very good relations with them.</sentence><sentence id="1006">And the -- my colleague, Fritz Uhlmann, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtheim</span>'s <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1007">He was working for the Keren Hayesod and for -- was in fact also a kind of "personne de confiance" for the Czech Jews and looking after their interests.</sentence><sentence id="1008">And he knew all the persons, and I knew through him most of them.</sentence><sentence id="1009">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> sent from time to time -- didn't send -- used employees of the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to commit messages.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And the girl came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uhlmann</span> and had learned by heart a certain number of things which she repeated.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Some extremely important things: about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, about some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> about movement, about <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1012">And this -- this type of initiative coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> existed, too.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And so you have a whole series of types of initiatives.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Later we were in contact

years.</sentence><sentence id="1316">In fact, the family resided in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> since 1914, when the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="1317">And they established themselves in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1318">And Ben Segalovitz is the specialist in the Jewish community on anti-Semitism and fights and is the head of the

true.</sentence><sentence id="1329">We were in constant contact.</sentence><sentence id="1330">We spoke on telephone two, three times a week at least.</sentence><sentence id="1331">What I was doing in the world scene, he was doing in the Swiss.</sentence><sentence id="1332">We were in very close personal relations and great personal respect for each other.</sentence><sentence id="1333">It was a little bit -- there is a certain veil on it that in the later years -- where he had a new girlfriend who was jealous of everything else and tried to disturb this very friendly relationship with which we had.</sentence><sentence id="1334">And one of the reasons was in -- that Moos didn't mention his name in his book, which I was very sorry.</sentence><sentence id="1335">I mentioned his name everywhere and gave the story and the -- it's not only that he deserves to be credited.</sentence><sentence id="1336">He immediately brought this to my knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="1337">But we did everything together from that moment on.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And he is one of the finest human beings which I have been working with in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1339">I really give the highest credit to him and to his integrity and his competence and his dedication to all Zionists and -- okay.</sentence><sentence id="1340">He telephones me.</sentence><sentence id="1341">He doesn't say what it is.</sentence><sentence id="1342">He said, "We have to meet immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1343">When can we meet?"</sentence><sentence id="1344">Two days later in <span

id="1355">Is this imaginable?</sentence><sentence id="1356">Are we a victim of some manipulation?"</sentence><sentence id="1357">And we -- from this moment on we think together.</sentence><sentence id="1358">I mean in the real -- the best way of cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And for hours we turn around the argument.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And I must say, there is another element which -- now, we -- he and I knew more or less the same things.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I shared with him what I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And he helped bring about -- and people like him brought people who informed us.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And I had in my mind something which had deeply impressed me.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I blink</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1368">1 backwards.</sentence><sentence id="1369">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Witzen</span> (Ph), 1939, half a year before the war started, I had to

class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1371">There was a question of principle, not only the five, six thousand Jews, but also this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> under the League of Nations supervision, that if the highest moral authority in the world cannot stop this, we cannot take this without protest.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And, therefore, we fought for -- very, very symbolically, also.</sentence><sentence id="1373">But also really for the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresta</span> (ph), too.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And he was one of the two representatives.</sentence><sentence id="1375">His name was -- I think Walter Gerson, a lawyer, one of the two leaders of the community with whom we had to do -- to deal.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1376">The other was also a lawyer, Rosenzweig, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1377">Was it Rosenberg or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenzweig</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1378">We have to find out -- Bernard (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1379">And he visited me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Witzen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1380">We made a long <span class="DLF">promenade</span> on the first holiday through the campagne (i.e. open spaces surrounding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>) in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva campagne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1381">And, of course, the situation was terribly tense.</sentence><sentence id="1382">And we knew, all of us, that only a war can put an end to this.</sentence><sentence id="1383">And we knew, all of us, that the war was a terrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="1384">And everybody was split in his own feelings.</sentence><sentence id="1385">What should one wish for?</sentence><sentence id="1386">Without the war, Hitler would never end.</sentence><sentence id="1387">With the war, terrible things could happen.</sentence><sentence id="1388">And then, while we had this feeling, all of us, he starts telling me, "You know, when the war will come, what will be our destiny?"</sentence><sentence id="1389">And he paints with an absolutely fantastic imagination the situation of the Jewish people if Hitler starts a war, where millions of the Jews will -- will be killed and disappear.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1390">Now, spelling out something which we all felt somehow but we never dared say it aloud.</sentence><sentence id="1391">It shook me.</sentence><sentence id="1392">I never forgot it.</sentence><sentence id="1393">It was a kind of prophecy which, as I said, we felt it, but we didn't dare say it.</sentence><sentence id="1394">And when people say the Jews wanted the war, it's all nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="1395">The Jews were terribly divided in themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1396">What can we help?</sentence><sentence id="1397">What can we hope?</sentence><sentence id="1398">While we go there along the <span

But this is a terrible story.</sentence><sentence id="1421">It's unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1422">You have to tell me -- you have to remind me, that I say Walter Gerson.</sentence><sentence id="1423">He was killed in the first ---?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1424">TAPE #4 Q. What happened, Dr. Riegner, to this man who gave you a prophecy about the fate of European Jewry?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1425">A. When I remembered this prophecy, I had to remember his very sad end.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And the Germans marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the fall 1939.</sentence><sentence id="1427">There was shortly after a pogrom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bromberg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> -- must have been in October or so -- where five thousand Jews were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1428">And Walter Gerson, who had fled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span> to the <span class="REGION">Polish territories</span>, was one of the first victims of this pogrom.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I had not forgotten this.</sentence><sentence id="1430">Now, let me tell you why I believed -- and I can I believe say also Segalovitz believed the truth of the story.</sentence><sentence id="1431">There were three major reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1432">The first was that Hitler had himself announced a number of times, usually on the anniversary of the day that he took power, the 30th of January, where there were usually a great manifestation.</sentence><sentence id="1433">And already on the 30th of January 39, before the war broke out, he threatened the Jews, whom he accused to want to push for the war, and he threatened them that if -- one thing is certain, he said.</sentence><sentence id="1434">This war, if it breaks out, will not end with the defeat of the German people.</sentence><sentence id="1435">It will end with the extermination of the Jewish people in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1436">He repeated this threat a number of times, usually, as I said, on the 30th of January.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And I remembered this.</sentence><sentence id="1438">I was following this in "36</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1441">4 already in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1442">And I was usually commenting on such speeches to a number of journalists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> who followed together with me these speeches.</sentence><sentence id="1443">And I said to myself, we haven't taken Mein Kampf seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1444">He announced all what he was going to do.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And nobody had taken it seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1446">Here again is a threat.</sentence><sentence id="1447">Nobody is taking it seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1448">But now we cannot ignore it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1449">This was the first reason.</sentence><sentence id="1450">The second reason was -- we are on the last of July, the first of August -- and as I told you before, we knew, of course, many things which happened before.</sentence><sentence id="1451">We knew of the deportations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, from other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1452">But something was new.</sentence><sentence id="1453">On the 14th, 15th of July, 1942, suddenly -- and nobody understood why -- tens of thousands of Jews were arrested, in all great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> of <span class="REGION">western Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1454">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1455">Suddenly, tens of thousands of people were arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And in the week before already the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> of deportations left to the east.</sentence><sentence id="1457">As I said, nobody understood why suddenly this happens.</sentence><sentence id="1458">The report of Schulte gave the explanation.</sentence><sentence id="1459">Behind all this there was a plan.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Behind all what we knew about the starvation, the terrible living conditions, the ghettoization, the deportations, the mass murders -- behind all this was one decisive fact, a decision by the Nazis to exterminate the totality of the Jews of Europe.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1461">And the third reason why I believed it has very much to do with my own origin from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I knew the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I knew their brutality.</sentence><sentence id="1464">I knew their fanaticism.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I knew that, contrary to all other enemies in history which we have encountered, we have here a group which is absolutely fanaticized, which is absolutely determined to live up to its aims and for whom the Jew was a personification of the devil, the personification of everything evil in the world, and that it was one -- not one, but the central aim of the Nazi party program.</sentence><sentence id="1466">It is characteristic that in his first political letter to a comrade written in September 1919, long before he published Mein Kampf -- it's the first document of political character which we know of Hitler until his famous political</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1470">5 last will, the day when he committed suicide, on the 29th of April, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1471">In his first political until his last political document, the fight against world Jewry is considered by him his major aim.</sentence><sentence id="1472">And he preaches this in 1919 as in 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1473">I knew about their brutality.</sentence><sentence id="1474">I have already spoken about my experiences as a student in the student elections.</sentence><sentence id="1475">But I have seen it, also, in my experience, the day when they arrived to power, the demonstrations on the 30th of January, on the 1st of April, the boycotting.</sentence><sentence id="1476">I knew about who had burned the <span class="BUILDING">Reichstag</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1477">When I left in May 19 -- Q. 133?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1478">A. --"33, I knew about the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.748639" long="13.236928">Oranienburg</span>, and in -- other <span class="NPIP">place</span> which escapes me at the moment.</sentence><sentence id="1479">I knew about the torture of his political enemies which took place in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the former Communist newspaper, the Rote Fahne.</sentence><sentence id="1480">And everybody who was a little bit interested in the political affairs knew it.</sentence><sentence id="1481">I knew about the violence with which they fought their political enemies.</sentence><sentence id="1482">There was a famous story about the murder in a Polish -- German Polish frontier city, which -- in which they ruthlessly turned the facts upside down, and we knew that the German Nazis were full of fanaticism and did not know any ethical or moral limits to their exercise of power, that for them, good is what benefits <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, as the Nazis understood it, was the essence of their doctrine.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And in this, the Jewish question was the central point.</sentence><sentence id="1484">Now, I did not limit myself to convincing myself that all these reasons made the report of Schulte very probable and very nearly convinced myself that it is an accurate report.</sentence><sentence id="1485">I told so, also, the American vice-consul, whom I met.</sentence><sentence id="1486">My idea after having met together with Segalovitz -- Koppelmann, who confirmed what Segalovitz had reported to me, who told us a little bit more</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1490">6 about his relations with Schulte, his reports which he had brought before with regard to the development of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1491">Amongst other things, he had rightly informed them of the date of the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And a number of other similar reports turned out to be completely correct, which gave us the conviction that we had to do with a very serious source.</sentence><sentence id="1493">And this -- Q. At this point you still didn't know his name?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1494">A. At this point I didn't still know his name.</sentence><sentence id="1495">I didn't want to see him, and he didn't want to see us.</sentence><sentence id="1496">Don't forget: We are, after all, at war with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and the whole situation was terribly tense, and -- but the reports about his reliability and his antecedence gave us a good measure of conviction that we had to deal with a very serious source.</sentence><sentence id="1497">I decided to keep the whole story to myself, and only to consult Professor Gugenheim, who was our legal advisor.</sentence><sentence id="1498">And when Nahum Goldman left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in 1940, he asked me in very serious problems to consult <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span> as a major person with whom I should be in contact.</sentence><sentence id="1499">I had written the same evening a long letter to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1500">I told him what I found out and told him what I had intention to do and wanted his consent.</sentence><sentence id="1501">And he spoke to me the next day on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1502">He agreed to the plan.</sentence><sentence id="1503">As a very careful, prudent, good, Swiss citizen, he moderated some of my phrases and introduced some cautious words.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1504">Q. These were the phrases that were in the telegram you proposed to send out to the Americans and the British?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1505">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1506">I made a draft of a telegram which I wanted to give the Americans and the British, and he moderated this a little bit, but the basic -- some people later have accused me, "But you didn't</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1510">7 believe yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1511">You have put in some cautious words."</sentence><sentence id="1512">But if you would see what I sent to the American vice-consul -- the consul was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1513">He was on vacation -- and to the British vice-consul, you would see, and -- Mr. Elting, who was the American vice-consul, has written about this, given some information of it -- you will see that I was very strong in my convictions.</sentence><sentence id="1514">And I told them, in spite of these words, that I was convinced that the things were serious, and I gave him all the reasons why I believed in it.</sentence><sentence id="1515">Elting must have consulted his chief, Mr. Squire, a consul, whom I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1516">Elting I had never met.</sentence><sentence id="1517">And they agreed, and he sent the text to Bern legation, and that they should forward everything to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">I said, in fact, three things to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elting</span>: "Inform your government, check the contents, what I tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1519">You have the <span class="BUILDING">Secret Service</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">I don't.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And three, give this telegram to Wise, the president of the World Jewish Congress, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1522">And I said the same to the vice-consul of the British, and asked him to give the -- send the telegram to Mr. Sydney Silverman, who was the chairman of the British section of the World Jewish Congress and a very prominent member of the British Parliament.</sentence><sentence id="1523">In fact, the two telegrams were identical, with one exception, and it's very typical, the exception.</sentence><sentence id="1524">The telegram to Silverman said at the end, "Inform and consult <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1525">Now, as I had sent the other telegram to Wise, it doesn't make much sense, but it shows that I was not convinced that the Americans would deliver the telegram to Wise, and that I was convinced that the British, because of their parliamentary traditions, would not dare not deliver the message to a prominent member of Parliament, and my guess was true.</sentence><sentence id="1526">It happened exactly like this.</sentence><sentence id="1527">The Americans did not deliver the message to Wise and informed me so by letter from Mr. Squire, the American consul, on the date of the 24th of August, in which he writes that (reading) "I am informed that the legation at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> transmitted the substance of this telegram to the Department of State for delivery to Dr. Wise in its discretion, but it is now in receipt of</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1531">8 telegraphic instructions from the department which indicate that it is disinclined to deliver the message in question in view of the apparently unsubstantiated character of the information which forms its main theme."</sentence><sentence id="1532">Now, I don't know what I could have substantiated more.</sentence><sentence id="1533">I know we know from some of the historians who have studied the files in the State Department that some people were afraid of Wise, and if the rabbi finds out, he will make a big scandal.</sentence><sentence id="1534">But this is only the first instance of a very unfriendly attitude of the Department of State in this whole matter.</sentence><sentence id="1535">With regard to the British, they delivered the message to Sydney Silverman, although it took ten days, and I never found out why.</sentence><sentence id="1536">Apparently they looked for him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, but the parliamentary session was finished, and so he was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> and -- but it's not clear why they couldn't find him earlier.</sentence><sentence id="1537">Finally, they found him, but he didn't believe in the thing, either.</sentence><sentence id="1538">And you study today the files which have been published -- after all, this is now public -- to a great extent, at least -- public property, you will see the marks in the file of the State Department: "These are wild rumors borne out of Jewish fears."</sentence><sentence id="1539">For the first ten or fourteen days, or even more, nobody cared for the substance, what I had informed.</sentence><sentence id="1540">They only asked, "Who is Riegner?"</sentence><sentence id="1541">And my name was at that time completely unknown, for several reasons.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1542">One of the reasons, that my family was until the end of 1938 still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I had asked all colleagues in the Congress to keep my name out of circulation and out from documents.</sentence><sentence id="1543">So nobody had seen my name.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And when they asked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish agency</span> and some other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, they didn't know me, either, because I had nothing to do with them.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So this was only -- slowly when other reports came in in the same direction, with the same content, they finally started to give some -- Q. Credence, believability?</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1549">9 A. Yeah -- believability to these reports.</sentence><sentence id="1550">And I am -- some of the historians have shown that my telegram finally has completely changed the attitude of the British government in the case -- on the whole subject of war crimes and war criminals.</sentence><sentence id="1551">Now, when the telegram was received by Silverman, he tried to telephone to Wise in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and was prevented by the War Department to do so.</sentence><sentence id="1552">Finally, the War Department sent a coded telegram to Wise in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, from Silverman -- and it is only when this arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, was fully informed.</sentence><sentence id="1553">Now, the question about how did the Jews react to -- let's say the Congress people?</sentence><sentence id="1554">This is something which I am, of course, interested very much, and I have three or four witnesses on which I can report.</sentence><sentence id="1555">I asked my colleague in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, Morris Bernzweig, who was the head of the International Affairs Department in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- who was British, but during the war he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- and asked him, "How did you react to this?</sentence><sentence id="1556">You were present when the telegram arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1557">Did you believe it, or did you have doubts?</sentence><sentence id="1558">What?"</sentence><sentence id="1559">He said clearly to me, "Nobody put this report into question.</sentence><sentence id="1560">We took it.</sentence><sentence id="1561">We accepted it."</sentence><sentence id="1562">As a matter of fact, Stephen Wise, when he got it, wrote two letters, deeply -- which he is deeply worried, deeply moved, deeply in despair, one to Justice Frankfurter, and he writes in a few lines that he received this message, and that he is in despair.</sentence><sentence id="1563">What could one do?</sentence><sentence id="1564">And he asked Frankfurter to inform the boss, which means Roosevelt, which Frankfurter has certainly done.</sentence><sentence id="1565">They were in very close relations.</sentence><sentence id="1566">And he underlines -- and this is very funny for me -- that the report come from one whom he names "very conservative."</sentence><sentence id="1567">Now, I have never been described by anybody as a very conservative person, but what Wise obviously meant, that I am very careful in my judgment, that I am not a "Schreier", and that I am known for my reliability and for my good judgment.</sentence><sentence id="1568">It's interesting to see such -- such words to appear when you feel you are really not a very conservative person.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1569">But -- in this sense of reliability and not exaggerating, and so on, it is very accurate.</sentence><sentence id="1570">The other</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1574">0 letter is even a much greater expression of despair, to his very close friend, the Pastor John -- James -- Holmes -- Hanes.</sentence><sentence id="1575">What's the name?</sentence><sentence id="1576">The pastor and the minister, the name -- you have to correct that -- the -- it's one of the closest friends -- a Protestant pastor with whom Wise was very close, and they exchanged the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> even, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1577">And there is in the letters which Foss has edited, an outburst of his despair, "What can we do?"</sentence><sentence id="1578">And sees that he is absolutely shaken at his foundations about this report, and sees the catastrophe and takes it for serious, too.</sentence><sentence id="1579">I mean, there is no doubt.</sentence><sentence id="1580">He has known me in "36 at the <span class="BUILDING">Congress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1581">He has known me on one or two other occasions when we met and had obviously great respect for my integrity and my reliability.</sentence><sentence id="1582">And Wise goes to Sumner Welles and -- not knowing, of course, that the telegram is laying in the State Department -- and Sumner Welles forbids the publication.</sentence><sentence id="1583">There are people who criticized Wise that he accepted this.</sentence><sentence id="1584">I don't know whether he was right or he was wrong.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1585">But he agreed that they will make other inquiries about the reliability of the content, the veracity of the content of the cable, and has decided to ask the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> and the International Red Cross for their opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1586">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> -- this I have described in one of my speeches in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> has a very strange attitude.</sentence><sentence id="1587">Titmann, who was the deputy to the official representative of the president to the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span>, insists a number of times to get information of the attitude of the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> on this information.</sentence><sentence id="1588">And finally, he gets a wishy-washy reply: "We know, also, that there are very bad reports coming in about the treatment of the Jews, but we have no onfirmation about the story of the extermination."</sentence><sentence id="1589">And more or less this is the reply.</sentence><sentence id="1590">Very strange.</sentence><sentence id="1591">Because the -- I believe the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> was at least as well informed as we were.</sentence><sentence id="1592">They had hundreds of priests who came -- traveled through Europe and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and informed the Vatican authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1593">A man, historian, former priest himself, Franconi, Carlo Franconi -- writes about the hundreds of reports who came and -- from all over and how much they -- how well they were</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1597">1 informed.</sentence><sentence id="1598">And in the documents which the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> has published themself, there are a number of very important facts, where you see that a number of Nuncios had very clearly reported about what is happening to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1599">There was a special man who was active, I believe, for the Order of Malta, who was pursuing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> some welfare activities, humanitarian activities, who writes a number of times reports already in May, and another in October, "42, where he -- one of the reports he says something like "There are two new things.</sentence><sentence id="1600">On the one hand, the bombardment of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, and the other is the intensification of the extermination of the Jews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1601">More than two million have already been killed."</sentence><sentence id="1602">I mean, this information was there.</sentence><sentence id="1603">Why the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> ignores it and doesn't tell it, 1 don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1604">And the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> didn't give any -- any concrete answer, either, International Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1605">Now, we will come back to the attitude of the Red Cross at a later point, where I will say what I have to say about the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Now, I see that one doesn't believe -- but doesn't believe, and there is now on -- two activities on parallel.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1607">The one activity is my own.</sentence><sentence id="1608">I try by all of the possible means to find corroborating evidence from other <span class="NPIP">sources</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1609">And the other is the activity especially of our British section, which was very active, was a wonderful group, of Lady Reading, of Silverman, of Baru(ph), of Alex Easterman, of -- a marvelous leadership group which was acting in a very fine, coordinated way.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1610">And they approach all the governments in exile, the British governments, and try to work on them.</sentence><sentence id="1611">And an interesting story there is that one of their best friends was President Benes of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, considered it a German provocation and didn't believe in it.</sentence><sentence id="1612">And on the other hand, the only one who believed it, accepted it as fact, was Ivan Maisky, the Russian mbassador, who probably had known by his own experience that the extermination of peoples is possible, even by so-called civilized <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">At the same time, they tried to obtain some kind of a statement of the Pope, through a concerted action of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> represented in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1617">2 taking up an idea which I had already a year earlier suggested in one of my letters to Nahum Goldman -- there is an attempt to obtain a collective statement of the Allied governments on the extermination of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1618">And this text is finally -- this is the real, immediate result of my telegram, is the declaration of the -- all the Allied governments -- which is of the 17th of December, 1942, where all the Allied governments and the French National Committee -- was not yet a government -- had solemnly denounced the extermination of the Jewish people, saying that this has been many times announced, threatened with, and now it is happening, and hundreds of thousands of people have already been killed, and they threatened with the retaliation -- with the punishment of those who are responsible.</sentence><sentence id="1619">This is a great moment.</sentence><sentence id="1620">Now the story is out.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1621">And it is published all over.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And even in the very careful, neutral <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, it makes the first pages in the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="1623">And one hopes now something will happen that something should happen.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And now starts a discussion between the two major Allied governments which goes on for six weeks, and nothing is happening.</sentence><sentence id="1625">You can read the pathetic appeal from the Archbishop of Canterbury in the <span class="BUILDING">House of Lords</span> and this, where he accuses the governments of complete inactivity and of being responsible for their not undertaking any action.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Even if you cannot do anything, you have to try at least.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And finally, after two months practically, it is decided there will be a conference between the British and the Americans, and they decide to hold this conference in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bermudas</span>, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1628">Q. Let me stop you there for a minute and back up for two things.</sentence><sentence id="1629">One, the information that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> were trying to get confirmed, in spite of the fact that the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> did not supply much information, the Americans did ultimately get additional information, including</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1633">3 indirectly some information from Carl Burckhardt, and I wonder if you could talk about how that...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1634">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1635">I will come to this now.</sentence><sentence id="1636">I have skipped one thing, and that the meeting with the American minister in October 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1637">Let me first say, when I saw that nothing was happening and that everybody was skeptical about the reports -- and this you feel, and you see that nothing is happening I was never in my life as desperate as during these weeks, when you know that the world is burning and nothing is happening, and on the contrary, I am sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> on this beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> with my view on the Mont Blanc, and the blue sky, and you know -- Q. Which you could see from your <span class="BUILDING">office</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1638">A. Hmm?</sentence><sentence id="1639">I saw this from my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1640">I was having an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with a beautiful view, and already three, four kilometers around are the Germans and the Italians.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And the whole world is in flames, and you see this beauty of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and the <span class="DLF">sky</span>, and it's a provocation to your existence.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And I am waiting and waiting to any reaction positive, and nothing comes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1643">So I am trying to -- to get information, other information.</sentence><sentence id="1644">But on this I must say I was quite successful.</sentence><sentence id="1645">There were four major confirmations which I obtained, direct or indirect.</sentence><sentence id="1646">The first were some letters which were addressed to the Jewish relief organization of the Aguda in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, addressed by a man who lived outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and which was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucerne</span>, informing them in a certain coded language, with Hebrew words and other words, of the beginning of the deportation of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, which started -- and this we know -- on the 25th of July, the day when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czerniakow</span>, the Judenaelteste, committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1647">And every day</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1651">4 six thousand people were taken and -- from the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1652">And they write in two letters in this kind of coded language that the people are being taken day by day to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And the words are clear -- it is gayROOSH.</sentence><sentence id="1654">It is complete extermination and killing, and so there is for the first time a confirmation even from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that this extermination is happening there.</sentence><sentence id="1655">Number two, at the beginning of September, I believe, comes to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> a young man who saw the extermination of the total Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> in November and December 1941.</sentence><sentence id="1656">That means nine months or ten months before.</sentence><sentence id="1657">A young man, a student of medicine, who escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, worked for several months in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as a non-Jew, and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.4325" long="14.548">Stettin</span>, and finally succeeds to get a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where he has some relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And when he arrives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, I am informed, and I have a meeting with him, and I question him for six or eight hours about what he knew, and he gives a very detailed report of how in two nights the Nazis -- ?,</sentence><sentence id="1659">was military -- killed by machine guns -- I think thirty-six thousand or something Jews in two nights, among whom the very famous Jewish historian, Simon Dubnow, who was, by the way, very near the ideals of the World Jewish Congress and whom we revered very much.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1660">Nobody knew about this.</sentence><sentence id="1661">For nine months the world was completely silent, that you can't kill such -- do such exterminations without anybody knowing.</sentence><sentence id="1662">It showed that -- what was going on was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1663">The third was even more intriguing.</sentence><sentence id="1664">One day I get a telephone call from a doctor in the Jewish -- in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, a Jewish doctor in the hospital of Geneva, very fine lady, good friend of mine, said, "Come here.</sentence><sentence id="1665">I have to show you something very interesting," and it's worth my coming.</sentence><sentence id="1666">And I go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and she receives me -- she's dead also now -- and says, "I have here a very strange patient.</sentence><sentence id="1667">He is under police surveillance, and you are not allowed to see him, and you are not allowed to mention it, but I cannot begrudge.</sentence><sentence id="1668">You know much more the -- go and see him."</sentence><sentence id="1669">And I spent six hours in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and take down what this fellow tells me.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1673">5 And it's -- as I always say, in extraordinary times are extraordinary events.</sentence><sentence id="1674">A young man who is taken in -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> -- this I forgot -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, in one of these mass arrests, and being sent to the camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malines</span>, from where they are deported to the east.</sentence><sentence id="1675">And he gives me the exact description on what happened every day in the process of deportation, from Malines in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span>, up to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, where he finally ends up in -- near -- the front of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, near Rava Ruskaya.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And then he describes every <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, what happened, and so on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1677">Not only he tells me he was in -- put down, put to -- engaged in works for the fortification at the front.</sentence><sentence id="1678">And one day, an officer comes and asks somebody whether -- who could drive?</sentence><sentence id="1679">He needs a driver.</sentence><sentence id="1680">And as he is a mechanic, working in -- was a Polish Jew living in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, working in some mechanic(al) establishment, he offers himself, and he is taken.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And he is -- ten days going with the German officer, accompanying him in his travels in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1682">And he uses this pportunity to ask the German officer, "What happened?</sentence><sentence id="1683">What happened there?</sentence><sentence id="1684">What happened here?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1685">Why?"</sentence><sentence id="1686">And the German officer, who is fed up with the war, lost already two of his brothers, tells him, "It's very simple.</sentence><sentence id="1687">Those who are up to work, they take them to work.</sentence><sentence id="1688">Those who are not up to work, they be exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="1689">Those who are not any more up to work, they have the same fate."</sentence><sentence id="1690">So easy it was.</sentence><sentence id="1691">In three sentences, the whole tragedy of the Jewish people was described by this German officer.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And the German officer, as I said, who was fed up with the war, decides to save this Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1693">In an unbelievable story, he hides him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> full of uniforms of people who fell in the battles around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, and hides him in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and gives him food and gives him occupation mark, and said, "You remain in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> until it stops.</sentence><sentence id="1694">And then you can try to get out."</sentence><sentence id="1695">And he leaves -- I don't know -- four or five days.</sentence><sentence id="1696">He didn't know himself how long it was.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And finally this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops.</sentence><sentence id="1698">Finally, didn't move any more.</sentence><sentence id="1699">And he gets out, and he is near the Gare de I'Est in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1700">Now, you imagine from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> practically, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rava</span></sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1704">6 Ruskaya, to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1705">And he -- he has some occupation marks.</sentence><sentence id="1706">He finds his way, he goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Plaetzl</span>, finds Jewish advice, goes to the <span class="REGION">nonoccupied France</span> and finds the way.</sentence><sentence id="1707">He comes over the mountains of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and is arrested by some of the soldiers, and as he is typical -- as for many people deported -- swollen feet and -- and bones and legs.</sentence><sentence id="1708">They bring him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to be treated.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And there he is.</sentence><sentence id="1710">Unbelievable that such things are possible.</sentence><sentence id="1711">But I questioned him.</sentence><sentence id="1712">You know, I was a kind of a judge once -- inquisition judge in the proceedings which I had in the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1713">And I questioned him for hours and hours.</sentence><sentence id="1714">Very simple person, straightforward, and there was no doubt that what he said was the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1715">And yet he gave the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="1716">From an eyewitness who had seen it.</sentence><sentence id="1717">And then comes the fourth, the most interesting in certain ways.</sentence><sentence id="1718">When we had the idea -- we had the report from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schulte</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1719">I suggested to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span> that we should ask the Red Cross whether they had any reports which confirmed.</sentence><sentence id="1720">And making it not too official, we decided that he should privately ask the vice president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Carl Burckhardt, who is a colleague of his in the <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> which I spoke, the Institute de Hautes Etudes Internationales, and he should ask him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">professors" lounge</span> -- not in a formal way, but in a more private, confidential way.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1721">And he does this, and -- somewhere in the beginning of September.</sentence><sentence id="1722">And Burkhardt confirms to him that his reports are very similar, that he has confirmation from two German diplomats, the one from a member of the staff of the <span class="BUILDING">German foreign office</span>, the other, a representative of the military establishment.</sentence><sentence id="1723">He says "Defense Department."</sentence><sentence id="1724">Q. War Ministry, yeah.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1728">7 A. War Ministry.</sentence><sentence id="1729">It seems that this was not a very correct description, but it's clear that he meant the military establishment.</sentence><sentence id="1730">And very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1731">He uses the words which are the key words in this whole process that means "Judenfrei", make the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> "Judenfrei.".</sentence><sentence id="1732">When you read the reports which Heidrich made to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ribbentrop</span>, the regular reports about the progress of the extermination process in the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, in all of these reports, you see "Judenfrei."</sentence><sentence id="1733">And Burckhardt knows -- says "Judenfrei" as he says, well -- there is no possibility of settlement or of emigration.</sentence><sentence id="1734">It is clear that it means in reality the killing of the people.</sentence><sentence id="1735">Now, this, of course, is extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span> was doubtful whether I should use this information.</sentence><sentence id="1737">In any case -- I will come to it in a moment -- shortly after, we were invited by the American minister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>, Lichtheim and myself, to report to him what we knew about the whole process.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1738">This was suggested by Wise to Sumner Welles, and -- and we were invited by the American minister.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And knowing what it was all about, because Wise informed us, put all what you have on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to let people -- I saw they didn't believe us.</sentence><sentence id="1740">Maybe now is the moment or never.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1741">And we write together a memorandum of about thirty-five pages, with a short introduction.</sentence><sentence id="1742">And then we add all the reports which we have and some general evaluation of the situation in various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, with all the annexes and the documents, including these letters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, including the Sivian (?)</sentence><sentence id="1743">report, including the report from the man who was in Rava Ruskaya and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1744">All together it's about thirty-five pages.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1745">Q. Stop there.</sentence><sentence id="1746">Because they're about to run out of tape.</sentence><sentence id="1747">We'll talk about your meeting you and Lichtheim, meeting with Harrison.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1748">A. Yeah.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1752">8 Q. Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1753">Save that for the next tape.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1754">A. They have to change?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1755">Q. Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1756">Q. Dr. Riegner, you were about to tell us about the information, the memorandum you brought in for the American minister, Leland Harrison, in October.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1757">A. Now, I felt very seriously that this was the decisive date.</sentence><sentence id="1758">Either they will believe us or they will not believe us.</sentence><sentence id="1759">And, therefore, I was decided to tell all I knew, including the name of the person from whom the original report came.</sentence><sentence id="1760">And we agreed that we would not pronounce the name, but we would put it on a piece of paper and give it to the minister in a closed envelope, and this is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1761">On the other hand, I also decided that I had to inform the minister that the -- about the Burckhardt interview of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1762">I felt that this was an extremely important, positive support for our whole story, and I had to tell it.</sentence><sentence id="1763"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span> was not very happy about this.</sentence><sentence id="1764">He felt it was more of personal information, and I disregarded it and told the minister the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="1765">I said to him that I doubt that Gugenheim would confirm it in this way, but without naming the person, he may.</sentence><sentence id="1766">It was -- the meeting with the minister was extremely interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1767">He read -- I never had such a meeting with any diplomat in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1768">When he saw that we had prepared the memorandum, he immediately took it and started reading it.</sentence><sentence id="1769">We were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for probably twenty-five, thirty minutes without any word was spoken.</sentence><sentence id="1770">When he had</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1774">9 finished, he started again and asked questions.</sentence><sentence id="1775">What he thought of it, we couldn't guess.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1776">Lichtheim, with a good sense of humor, said, "Mr. Poker Face."</sentence><sentence id="1777">And he looked like a poker face.</sentence><sentence id="1778">But as a matter of fact, as we know today, we convinced him on that date.</sentence><sentence id="1779">He didn't believe us before.</sentence><sentence id="1780">But the documentation, it convinced him, and he obviously gave a positive recommendation.</sentence><sentence id="1781">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1782">You may have readed -- read what exactly he wrote.</sentence><sentence id="1783">I have never seen it.</sentence><sentence id="1784">But it is clear that from that moment on, he was on our side.</sentence><sentence id="1785">He asked that Gugenheim should make an affidavit about what we told him, and he asked an affidavit from Sivian, and the name of the other fellow was -- whom I met in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I didn't give him.</sentence><sentence id="1786">I didn't want to make trouble for the doctor who let us in.</sentence><sentence id="1787">But I gave it later in a special letter to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> so they knew, also, that the man -- and maybe they have approached him.</sentence><sentence id="1788">I don't know.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1789">Q. Sivian was the Latvian who described the massacres outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1790">A. Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1791">But the -- the other fellow was -- not -- the name escapes me at the moment, but I have it if you want.</sentence><sentence id="1792">And I gave him -- gave them the address, too.</sentence><sentence id="1793">He was in the meantime in some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1794">Well, then -- then something happened which I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1795">He sent the consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, Mr. Squire, to Burckhardt behind our back, and interviewed them, what he knew about the extermination policy and what he knew from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1796">And as a matter of fact, Burckhardt repeated to Squire exactly what he had told us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1797">There are two notes from Squire which Mr. Moos found in the files of the State Department and which he sent to me afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1798">It is exactly the same what he said to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gugenheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1799">That -- the very strange fact remains that Burckhardt has never said these things to his own colleagues</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1802">0 on the International Committee of the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1803">Professor FalVAY, who had access to everything -- all the files in the International Red Cross, who has seen practically everything, confirms that there is no trace whatsoever of this.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And the strange thing is that Burckhardt tells very proudly to Squire that there was a proposal of -- making a protest or appeal to the Germans on the part of the Red Cross, and he -- he doesn't tell him that he was against it and voted against it and stopped it.</sentence><sentence id="1805">He presents it as if this was a great positive fact which he supported.</sentence><sentence id="1806">Now, these are very strange things.</sentence><sentence id="1807">And it's not very clear.</sentence><sentence id="1808">I have my ideas about this, why he did this.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1809">Q. Do you want to tell us what you -- A. I think it should really come somewhere else.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1810">Q. Allright.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1811">A. It doesn't fit in in the story at the moment.</sentence><sentence id="1812">But when we speak about the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>, we can perhaps come back to it.</sentence><sentence id="1813">So when this -- all these documents are arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, in November, then everybody is now convinced that we -- we have a case and we are right.</sentence><sentence id="1814">Three months or more have passed.</sentence><sentence id="1815">Every day, thousands of Jews have been killed.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And nothing has happened in the meantime.</sentence><sentence id="1817">But now Sumner welles allows Wise to go public, and he does.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1818">Some people say it wasn't published in -- sufficient publicity.</sentence><sentence id="1819">Maybe yes, maybe no.</sentence><sentence id="1820">In any case, the matter is public.</sentence><sentence id="1821">And this now leaves -- and here I made a mistake -- I went already to the Declaration of the 17th of December.</sentence><sentence id="1822">Perhaps we can turn this around in the tape.</sentence><sentence id="1823">We -- we</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1826">1 get to this Declaration which was published simultaneously in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> on the 17th of December, and -- denouncing the extermination of the Jewish people and threatening the responsible with punishment after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1827">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, it is done in the form of a question in <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> to the government, and Sydney Silverman asked this question, which Eden replies.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And a very moving gesture: The whole <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span> stands up for two minutes to pay tribute, homage to the victims.</sentence><sentence id="1829">And a man -- Eden himself says he was struck by the emotion which prevailed in the <span class="BUILDING">House</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1830">And a man like Lloyd George, who was the oldest member of the <span class="BUILDING">Parliament</span>, said he had never seen anything alike in the history of the British Parliament.</sentence><sentence id="1831">But this, of course, didn't make the people alive again.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And we wait now for action.</sentence><sentence id="1833">And as I said, there are negotiations, and finally it is decided to meet in the <span class="COUNTRY">Bermudas</span> and to discuss what action is to be taken.</sentence><sentence id="1834">This is the moment where the Jewish organizations in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, everywhere <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the free world, get very active and devise an actions program of what should be done and what can be done.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And this program is being formulated and -- with fifteen points.</sentence><sentence id="1836">We may be coming back on some of the points when we say what happened and what didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="1837">In any case, it's not true that the Jews were not prepared for action, but the governments were not prepared for action.</sentence><sentence id="1838">That is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And <span class="COUNTRY">Bermuda</span> is chosen so that the -- the public cannot follow too much what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="1840">Nobody is allowed access to the <span class="BUILDING">conference</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1841">The whole thing is kept in great secret, and the great secret that only comes out very slowly -- the great secret is that they didn't decide anything.</sentence><sentence id="1842">Now, when this becomes true, when this becomes public, when this gets out, this is the most crucial moment in the whole history of the war for the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="1843">And the people are completely shaken.</sentence><sentence id="1844">Yitzhak Greenberg, one of the very respected members of the Jewish community here, of the labor -- Jewish labor movement, writes a famous article, "Bankrupt," and at this moment, in effect, it was complete</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1847">2 bankruptcy.</sentence><sentence id="1848">Now we come later back to the reason why nothing was undertaken.</sentence><sentence id="1849">But here the most important thing is this: There have been attacks later against the leadership and especially against Stephen Wise and the Zionist leadership that they did not use their influence to push through a program.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And they are accused of having sacrificed the rescue effort to the -- Q. Zionist cause?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1851">A. -- to the importance of the fight for the establishment of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">This is, in my opinion, a very unjust accusation.</sentence><sentence id="1853">They -- one puts the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> before the horse.</sentence><sentence id="1854">In reality, what has happened is that for the first time, the Jewish establishment understands that it cannot in this tragic situation count on our best friends.</sentence><sentence id="1855">It's a bankruptcy of the effort of rescue, which puts everybody into the position that if we cannot count on our best friends in such a tragic situation, then we have to have ourselves some sovereignty so that we can act.</sentence><sentence id="1856">It is not the sacrifice of the rescue effort to the idea of establishment of a state.</sentence><sentence id="1857">But the establishment of the state is the aim -- the first aim in the Jewish war aims.</sentence><sentence id="1858">It is the consequence of the bankruptcy of the rescue effort, of being abandoned by our best friends in whom we counted that they would do something.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And it's very unjust to confuse these issues.</sentence><sentence id="1860">And I think we have to correct this and we have to make this understood.</sentence><sentence id="1861">Wise has always tried still.</sentence><sentence id="1862">He was not the naive person many people want to see in him.</sentence><sentence id="1863">There is a letter which he writes to Nahum Goldman in -- I think it's April 1943, just during the time of the Bermuda conference.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goldman</span> is -- for the Passover holiday somewhere in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And Wise keeps him informed in this letter and writes to him, "The things are as we foresaw, going very bad, and from bad to worse.</sentence><sentence id="1866">Some people say we should publicly denounce the President.</sentence><sentence id="1867">I believe this would be a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="1868">He</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1871">3 can still try.</sentence><sentence id="1872">If we attack him, too, it will deprive us of our last support, and it will only give great satisfaction to the Congress, which is a really anti-Semitic Congress -- in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1873">Such letters -- and it should be shown in your archives here -- show that he was by far not a naive person whom people want him to be, that he was by far not blindly following Roosevelt in these things.</sentence><sentence id="1874">The relationship between Wise and Roosevelt went up and down in various ways, and it's not so simple at all.</sentence><sentence id="1875">But he had great admiration for Roosevelt.</sentence><sentence id="1876">There is no doubt.</sentence><sentence id="1877">And what Roosevelt did and what Roosevelt did not do I think is one of the points which we have to discuss also in the following discussions.</sentence><sentence id="1878">This chapter, therefore, ends with a terrible negative despair.</sentence><sentence id="1879">Nothing is happening, and we are attending, we are assisting at the killing of millions of Jews without any active counteraction.</sentence><sentence id="1880">I did not stop making proposals and reporting.</sentence><sentence id="1881">I was terribly pessimistic.</sentence><sentence id="1882">But my feeling was, you have to try, and if you don't succeed, you have to try again and you have to try again.</sentence><sentence id="1883">And I had enough energy to keep this through.</sentence><sentence id="1884">My good friend Lichtheim was even more pessimistic than I. And he wrote lots of letters, description which are today very valuable because they show the situation as it was.</sentence><sentence id="1885">I wrote much less letters.</sentence><sentence id="1886">I didn't like to write open letters through the mail which I knew would all fall into German hands and through the German censorship.</sentence><sentence id="1887">But I tried -- over again and again to get some ideas through and some rescue proposals.</sentence><sentence id="1888">And there are a number of very important reports, which you will find in the files of the Congress, in January 1943 and later, and one of the most important is the report of the telegram of April 1943, in which I make again a number of very important rescue proposals.</sentence><sentence id="1889">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telegram</span> had also its special fate.</sentence><sentence id="1890">In the meantime, the State Department had instructed the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> not to transmit any more private messages or messages of private organizations.</sentence><sentence id="1891">It is in reality meant against me.</sentence><sentence id="1892">The reason was if we cut off the source, then the Jewish organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> cannot cry and cannot push us and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1896">4 cannot threaten us.</sentence><sentence id="1897">It was a very simple way.</sentence><sentence id="1898">But when -- in April, the consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and the minister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> saw that I had very important proposals to make, they didn't understand why they shouldn't communicate this to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1899">They considered it very important.</sentence><sentence id="1900">So finally -- they didn't tell me that they had these instructions.</sentence><sentence id="1901">But they -- they said there were some problems.</sentence><sentence id="1902">Finally, they came to a very funny conclusion, whether I was ready to pay for the telegram.</sentence><sentence id="1903">So I was puzzled by this proposal.</sentence><sentence id="1904">And I said immediately "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1905">It was the most expensive telegram I ever sent in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1906">It was practically a full salary -- although my salary wasn't very high -- but nearly two hundred dollars it was.</sentence><sentence id="1907">You can imagine for what I worked at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1908">And I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1909">In the long run, it was a very cheap telegram.</sentence><sentence id="1910">It put into action --really, it led to the establishment of the War Refugee Board, of all the actions which were undertaken.</sentence><sentence id="1911">And when you put it in relation to this, it was a very, very cheap, cheap telegram.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1912">In any case, this telegram suggested two great actions.</sentence><sentence id="1913">One was the rescue action in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1914">| had been informed by the Jewish community leaders in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> through the Red Cross that there was a change in attitude of Marshall Antonescu and the Minister of the Interior with regard to the Jews and there may be possibilities of emigration from the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1915">| Now, this was sensational news, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1916">And they asked -- but they needed funds for this.</sentence><sentence id="1917">And the funds -- and there was a very original idea, that the funds would not have to be transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, but could be put in a -- in a blocked account in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1918">Now, this was a very attractive and sensational idea.</sentence><sentence id="1919">The second was the effort -- and this came from the people who were in the Jewish underground in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> -- a concerted effort to evacuate as many youngsters and children from these three <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> or towards <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And that they needed for this money, they needed for this weapons, they needed for this all kinds of material.</sentence><sentence id="1921">They needed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1925">5 falsify papers, identity papers, ration cards, and so on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1926">And this was the second great proposal.</sentence><sentence id="1927">When this telegram arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, they went to the Jewish authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1928">The matter was brought to Roosevelt himself and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morgenthau</span>, and apparently they agreed with the plans.</sentence><sentence id="1929">Although this was really going out of the normal ways.</sentence><sentence id="1930">But April passed, May passed, June passed.</sentence><sentence id="1931">In July, Stephen Wise goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morgenthau</span>, and says, "What happens?</sentence><sentence id="1932">Nothing has happened.</sentence><sentence id="1933">Where are you?"</sentence><sentence id="1934">Mr. Morgenthau says, "I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1935">We have agreed for a long time that this should happen."</sentence><sentence id="1936">And there he charges two of his assistants, Bader (Baylor ?)</sentence><sentence id="1937">and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DuBois</span>, to find out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And there comes the famous report of the two Protestant assistants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morgenthau</span> after having approached some of the people in the State Department, and they find out that the whole -- sabotage which is taking place in the State Department all the time, from the beginning of the suppression of my cable, from the instruction not to send any cables to me, up to the sabotage of this great rescue plan.</sentence><sentence id="1939">And they write a report for Morgenthau, which they -- to which they give.</sentence><sentence id="1940">The report is published.</sentence><sentence id="1941">Everybody can read it today.</sentence><sentence id="1942">It's a terrible indictment against the Department and is -- they give it the title, "On the Acquiescence of This Government in the Mass Murder of the Jews.".</sentence><sentence id="1943">Now, Morgenthau agrees, but the title is, after all, a little bit too strong, and he calls it "Report to the President."</sentence><sentence id="1944">But he is more clever than to give them -- him the report.</sentence><sentence id="1945">He asks his legal advisor, Professor Cox, to prepare a positive proposal of how to deal with these matters.</sentence><sentence id="1946">And he comes with the idea of a refugee -- War Refugee Board composed of representatives of the State Department, the reasury, and the War Department, which should be entrusted with the special task to deal with the problems of the victims of Nazi persecution and the help which can be given to them.</sentence><sentence id="1947">Roosevelt sees that the report of the two assistants is dynamite and sees that something has to be done and accepts quite favorably the idea of the War Refugee Board.</sentence><sentence id="1948">But in the meantime, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morgenthau</span> is</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1951">6 clever enough not to antagonize too much the State Department and -- what's his name?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1952">Secretary of State?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1953">Q. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cordell Hull</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1954">A. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cordell

Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1957"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hull</span> was -- A. Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1958">And he makes some approaches, and Cordell Hull gives in, and suddenly something happens and nobody understands why.</sentence><sentence id="1959">I am called on the day before Christmas, 23rd or "4th of 1943, to the legation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>, and say, "What?</sentence><sentence id="1960">What have you done?</sentence><sentence id="1961">The whole policy and the -- on the <span class="DLF">financial blockade</span> and the <span class="DLF">food blockade</span>, it's all set aside.</sentence><sentence id="1962">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="1963">What?"</sentence><sentence id="1964">And I didn't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1965">This was Wise's and Morgenthau's doing here.</sentence><sentence id="1966">In any case, full of admiration, I get handed out a document, the first license in which the World Jewish Congress is authorized to send to me as the first amount, twenty-five thousand dollars for rescue activity in favor of victims of Nazi persecution.</sentence><sentence id="1967">And one tells me that I can make proposals to change the text, and so on, and that it is only a first gesture, and if it works well, it can be repeated, and so on, and enlarged, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1968">But it is really a breakthrough, complete breakthrough.</sentence><sentence id="1969">And what we know today is that in the last moment, the <span class="BUILDING">British embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> tried on the request of the Ministry of -- Q.

late.</sentence><sentence id="2244">It was much too late.</sentence><sentence id="2245">It was...it came into force in the beginning of uh 1944.</sentence><sentence id="2246">If it would have been established a year earlier or two years earlier, it would have been probably much more efficient, but nevertheless, it was mainly the only decisive action which was taken, and the whole situation

you're perhaps critical on some of the actions he could have done more, but it was a decisive effect.</sentence><sentence id="2251">Number two...during the period during which it was active, that means generally "44 to ," | i May "45...this early the end of the war, uh twenty million dollars have been uced, Jewish money...I come to this later...twenty million dollars have been used in order to alleviate the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecuted victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but the great majority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money.</sentence><sentence id="2252">Now with this money, lots of things have been done but it was not only the money.</sentence><sentence id="2253">It was also the determination to explore all possibilities by which Jews uh people...victims could be helped and and the uh action of the Nazis counter-acted.</sentence><sentence id="2254">Uh my opinion, there were a number of things which were finally uh were obtained.</sentence><sentence id="2255">Uh on the one hand, for instance, there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh agreements.</sentence><sentence id="2256">There was a number of of uh prisoners of war who especially wounded and</sentence><sentence id="2258">8 and

have been much more energetically pursued, in my opinion (coughing) and it should have been.</sentence><sentence id="2264">I believe that <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> could have taken in the double or the triple of of people which they they took in, and w they're they're not so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who can say they took as many as <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> did, but but...and this was the general situation.</sentence><sentence id="2265">But this was important.</sentence><sentence id="2266">Then the what I said referred

a great decision, and I quoted how I was received in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> when the first license came and they were very astonished because the British had blockade and so the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A:Let's let's do this in a more systematic way.</sentence><sentence id="3036">But thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly played a role.</sentence><sentence id="3037">No doubt about it.</sentence><sentence id="3038">Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, but we have left out one, in my opinion, very important aspect, and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3039">I must tell you that from I would say probably October nineteen hundred forty-four on, I was...I had an obsession, a real obsession.</sentence><sentence id="3040">I was dread the fearing that at the end...it was clear that the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="3041">It was clear it dragged on, the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it, but the Germans who used children in the war effort and this was and I personally...maybe it's my education...I was afraid that the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's context it's ..uh when everything is lost, they would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive, they would take</sentence><sentence id="3043">07 them with them.</sentence><sentence id="3044">And I was absolutely obsessed by the idea that in the last moments they will make a slaughter of the three or four hundred thousand Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which were .</sentence><sentence id="3045">And I couldn't sleep and I told myself, what can we do in order to stop this And I had at a .1 133 certain moment the idea, alright let's make a great effort, a joint effort of everybody together, because everybody is in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3046">The French had their inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative to mobilize all the Allied forces in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> in order to organize a joint action to prevent this~ It wasn't too easy.</sentence><sentence id="3047">I was stateless too, without government.</sentence><sentence id="3048">There was no Israeli government.</sentence><sentence id="3049">There was no Jewish government.</sentence><sentence id="3050">There was no supported, and I took the initiative and I...the first question is who is neutral enough or in good relations with everybody that he could uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian government, and I approached the delegate from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at the League of Nations, and invite everybody, the French and the Belgians and the Dutch and the Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meantime...and the Romanians were also and the Greek, and he did.</sentence><sentence id="3051">And we had our first meeting I think was in November "44.</sentence><sentence id="3052">I was in uh in 8ern that day and came a little late to the to the meeting, and I was very pleased to see all the representatives either of real government representatives or the representatives of the Red Cross Society offices, <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>...they were all officials practically.</sentence><sentence id="3053">It was the same.</sentence><sentence id="3054">And uh and when | arrivedt he said the idea comes from Dr. Riegner.</sentence><sentence id="3055">Let him explain to you what what he wants.</sentence><sentence id="3056">And I uh explained to them that we we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and there was a great danger that this would happen, that at the last moments they would really suppress all the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they were capable of doing it, and 34 we should do a last desperate effort to save this and to prevent this.</sentence><sentence id="3057">And we discussed various ways, uh neutral <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and there was very considerable support, but of course they couldn't decide.</sentence><sentence id="3058">They had to ask their government, and uh we had several sessions.</sentence><sentence id="3059">The last session was in in...the decisive session was in I think February.</sentence><sentence id="3060">It went already in the next year because the governments</sentence><sentence id="3062">08 are very slow in replying, and there we all agreed we should ask the International Red Cross for a very special, high-level mission to the political authorities of of of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to prevent it.</sentence><sentence id="3063">And it was agreed and then these governments, they didn't have all relations between themselves and some didn "t recognize them, but they were all in agreement it should be done, and the idea was therefore not to to sign a joint paper but to...that everybody should submit this identical appeal to the President of the Red Cross uh for this purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3064">And I wrote the text, and uh everybody signed it, and at a certain day between ten and eleven, they all submitted the the signed appeal to the Red Cross, and this led to the last great action of in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he saw Carlton Brunner who was really the number two under under Himnler.</sentence><sentence id="3065">Now when called together all these people and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very, very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just take his (laughter) assurances for granted.</sentence><sentence id="3066">It opened up a certain number of activities for the Red Cross but I think much more important, it gave to the German government as a clear understanding that the whole Allied, all the 35 Allied governments together were determined not to let this happen.</sentence><sentence id="3067">And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that all the _ were uh by-passed by new events all the time, so that uh the agreements, the real agreements which were concluded between and the the German Nazis, the moment they were done really already by-passed and the and it's not so important whether they were implemented or not.</sentence><sentence id="3068">The the...it it created a decisive fact, political fact, that the the governments did not allow this to happen, and with few exceptions, it didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="3069">There are a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they tried to kill people, and they killed some of them, but relatively limited.</sentence><sentence id="3070">The action was, on the other hand, supported by the activities of who acted in the same <span class="DLF">line</span> with the on behalf of the Swedish _ and I was in contact, telephone and otherwise, with _ in in in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we tried at least to to coordinate and inform each other what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3071">I believe that strangely the uh people have dealt with the Holocaust and the...and so the people who got saved and were spared, nobody really</sentence><sentence id="3073">09 mentions this.</sentence><sentence id="3074">I think it's one...I think this is...the War Refugee Board was supporting us very much on this.</sentence><sentence id="3075">No doubt about it.</sentence><sentence id="3076">The American government asked us to keep them informed and at later meetings, they were present.</sentence><sentence id="3077">At the first meetings they were, I believe, not there.</sentence><sentence id="3078">In the later meetings, the British government also was present.</sentence><sentence id="3079">I mean, this was really...<span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and...was was a united front of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi question.</sentence><sentence id="3080">And uh I can only say the the the result was that the life of most of the people 36 0 was respected, which I consider was not a matter which was going without .</sentence><sentence id="3081">It was, by the way, not the only activity which this group undertook.</sentence><sentence id="3082">We alao addressed ourselves in the last days of the war to the Allies, and that they should allow uh columns of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with food and other medical and so to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and to see.</sentence><sentence id="3083">They should be not kept out because of military or bureaucratic reasons.</sentence><sentence id="3084">And we had...the the same group intervened with the Allied governments on on on these matters and probably the results were quite positive, the reaction on this.</sentence><sentence id="3085">Now I believe uh that uh Winston's man like Weinman says that the War Refugee Board saved two hundred thousand people or something such a figure, I I believe this

believe that the saving of the people, the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the last moment is is is one of the most things which we reached, saying this was also a

forty years with militarily, politically, which has had great influence on many understand this, and not to compare the situation of today with the situation forty or fifty years

different Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="3425">We have learned from the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="3426">We have learned from our isolationism.</sentence><sentence id="3427">We have learned that we can and decisive moments only count on .</sentence><sentence id="3428">You cannot apply the ways or or position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and 1940.</sentence><sentence id="3429">The great number of these methods were not available.</sentence><sentence id="3430">There were certainly not available during the war.</sentence><sentence id="3431">The police would have

time.</sentence><sentence id="3434">This is .</sentence><sentence id="3435">And the second uh third truth is that what happened was so terrible and so beyond any human understanding that people really couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="3436">And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3437">And concurs in one of his books in a very able way exemplified this point.</sentence><sentence id="3438">To exterminate a whole people including babies and sick people and...is something, and and and to throw babies into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas ovens</span>,
