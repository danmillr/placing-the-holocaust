<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: This -- As you know, a follow up interview, it's looking at really, the kind of post Holocaust years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="20">Q: I was curious, you said that you're going to <span class="BUILDING">Disney World</span> tomorrow.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: What did -- When you were a little kid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, could you have imagined that now, this many years later, this is what you'd be doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: No, I certainly did not.</sentence><sentence id="31">But I think that's probably true of a non-Holocaust person, too, that you don't really think what you're going to do as an adult, or even the fact that you're going to be grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="32">I mean, that's very old people, and it's very hard to think about.</sentence><sentence id="33">But I spent a lot of wonderful years, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> with my father, going to, not Disneyland, but to <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span>, and <span class="DLF">theme parks</span>, in a very small way, that - - with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller coasters</span>, and all that kind of stuff, so I have very fond memories of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: [inaudible] ... Is having a good time important to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Well, i -- when you say important, yes it certainly is, I'd rather have a good time than a bad time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="41">Important, I think at this point, health, and having my family remain healthy, and around me, is more important, but yeah, having a good time certainly is important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: Did the -- the going to the <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> with your family as a child --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: -- how did that stay with you during all of these quite un-amusing times you've had --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: That always stayed with me.</sentence><sentence id="48">It's really strange, because I know we're going to talk about the Hidden Children a little bit later, but the very first meeting I went to after our Hungarian group was formed, we sort of introduced each other, and everybody gave a little blurb of -- of the -- the war years, and I kind of ended up, not meaningly, sounding</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="53">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 4 like a Pollyanna, because everybody was telling not just horror stories, but of how terribly it affected them afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="54">Everybody blamed their misfortune, divorces, and everything else on the Holocaust, and I've -- not a matter of having gotten beyond it, but in many ways I have nice memories of certainly the -- the pre-war years, and my memories of the Holocaust, with all the horror, and being terribly afraid of many things, it was also a nurturing time.</sentence><sentence id="55">I was very conscious of -- of my parents taking care of me, and protecting me.</sentence><sentence id="56">Of providing me with food when there wasn't any to be had.</sentence><sentence id="57">I was a very finicky eater, it was a pain in the neck, you know, providing me with -- with anything I would eat.</sentence><sentence id="58">And during the time that we were hidden, I had a -- a boyfriend who was a year older than I, so we were 10 and 11, and we had a wonderful time.</sentence><sentence id="59">So, I think because my parents protected me, and made up majorly fictional, nonsensical thing in retrospect, but it helped me, I think, come out sort of a healthier person, without any of the post-war trauma that a lot of my friends, who are my contemporaries, still have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: You said they made up a fiction, what do you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Did you see the movie, "Life is Beautiful"?</sentence><sentence id="73">The Italian film that won all the awards?A lot of my friends thought the movie fictionalized, and trivialized the Holocaust, and I think you would have had to see the movie to know what I'm talking about, but it's -- when you see the movie, knowing it's about the Holocaust -- when I first went to the movies, for the first 20 minutes I thought I was in the wrong movie, because there was a comedy.</sentence><sentence id="74">It was silly, it was Marcelle Marceau and Chaplin all put into one, before the Holocaust theme takes place.</sentence><sentence id="75">And it was basically about a father protecting his child.</sentence><sentence id="78">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 5 didn't think it was trivialized at all.</sentence><sentence id="79">I really related to it, because the whole process, in some ways, my parents made up stories that I was able to accept.</sentence><sentence id="80">So I never had their fear, I always had their very positive attitude that my grandmother who had died in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, previous to the war, was a butterfly, and every time there was a butterfly flying around, it was my grandmother up there watching out for us.</sentence><sentence id="81">And to this day, you know, butterflies are kind of a meaningful thing.</sentence><sentence id="82">And there was always a positive thing, that things would be okay.</sentence><sentence id="83">So, I never had the fear that my parents had, but they wanted to be sure that I wouldn't, and I guess I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="84">I don't know if that makes any sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="102">I -- Yo-You had said that you previously had been able -- your -- your mother had instructed you that if she said it was black, it was black, and you were not to question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="106">That's absolutely true.</sentence><sentence id="107">That was probably the -- the only time that she spoke to me in very strong language, because I think somebody stopped us on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and asked us about our religion, and my mother said we were Catholic, and I kind of pulled at her, and disagreed, and aft-after that, my mother said that at any time, that our lives depended on it, and it's very important that I not question anything she says, and if she says it's one thing, it's -- if it's -- yes, that's absolutely -- that's the truth, but -- no, no, I mean that -- that was -- and I think -- you know, I think the European children are sort of brought up that way, so it wasn't quite as difficult for me to deal with.</sentence><sentence id="108">You know, your -- you speak when you're spoken to, and you don't question a lot, and I don't think today's generation would get away with that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="111"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0047 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Were there other instances where your mother -- where you had to comply with your mother when you knew she was not telling the truth?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: I think I -- well, the only other time, and it wasn't a ma -- even a matter of complying, but she -- she stole an egg, and I think I did tell that story in my video, and I remember that very clearly, cause everybody said where did you get the egg, and she said she ran into a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>, and chicken was laying an egg, and she took the egg because she made me a cake, and it needed an egg.</sentence><sentence id="114">A little yellow cake thing, and I -- I asked her about stealing, and I think she sort of -- gee, I don't remember all that well, but I don't think it was a major discussion, but she said that when you're hungry, sometimes -- it was there, she didn't think she was taking it from anybody else, so whatever.</sentence><sentence id="115">I was 10 years old, so I didn't go into it, in major, you know, depth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Was it primarily your mother then, who shaped you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: I think so.</sentence><sentence id="122">My father and I had a wonderful relationship.</sentence><sentence id="123">He was a very quiet and very loving man, very successful in business.</sentence><sentence id="124">My father -- I think the reason for that during the war years, is that by -- my mother did not look Jewish, and I was a little girl, and I -- I don't know what -- what it looks like, but I guess I didn't look obviously Jewish, I had blue eyes, and -- my father definitely looked Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="125">He had a no -- you know, a nose that was more obviously Jewish, and not only that, but what they were doing is -- had men just drop their pants, and that was certainly easy to identify.</sentence><sentence id="126">So, I think my father, during situations where we were questioned, or had to negotiate to stay at someone's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, or were stopped on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, my father always stayed in the background.</sentence><sentence id="127">In -- You know,</sentence><sentence id="129">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 7 during -- during the time of hiding, and also my father had a kidney stone problem, so my mother was very protective of his health.</sentence><sentence id="130">During -- Before the hiding, during the -- 01 -- the bombing, the air raids, my mother was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and we went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and all that kind of stuff, so she had more mobility, and was able to accomplish more, we stayed more in the background.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: When you were growing up, though, before you were 10, before all of this happened,</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="148">was he a strong presence?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Oh yes, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="150">Every Sunday we went to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span>, we went to the <span class="DLF">playground</span>, we went to the <span class="DLF">amusement park</span>, and he would come -- I had this huge world map on the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, or the wall of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and every evening after he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, we would play a game of identifying capitals.</sentence><sentence id="151"><span class="COUNTRY">Countries</span> all over the world, and eventually <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>, and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oceans</span>, and stuff, and it was -- it was a different kind of life than today.</sentence><sentence id="152">The fathers came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the end of the day, mothers kind of took care of all the bathing and getting you to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and all that kind of stuff, but I had a very, very close relationship with my father, and a -- a very loving relationship.</sentence><sentence id="153">In some ways, I think I was probably closer to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Is he still alive?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Excuse me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Is he still alive?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="174">He died when I was pregnant with my daughter, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="175">He was -- Actually, I was the last person that he saw.</sentence><sentence id="176">I went up to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, in 1957, to show him my first batch of</sentence><sentence id="178"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0047 8 maternity clothes, and he died on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">He got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fifth Avenue bus</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, lived on <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span>, my mother's still there, and he got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and he died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: Was he ill?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: He had a heart condition.</sentence><sentence id="192">I was really not even aware of how serious it was, I mean, he was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that day, he wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Are you still close to your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Yes, my mother is having a very hard time right now, actually.</sentence><sentence id="198">My mother is 87, and she has dementia.</sentence><sentence id="199">So, up to two years ago, she was in better health than most of my contemporaries, and actually, she still is, except for the fact that she gets very confused, she's getting depressed.</sentence><sentence id="200">She still goes to the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonic</span>, she still goes to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">She lives at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span>, but she's aware that she's not as well as she was, not physically, but mentally.</sentence><sentence id="202">They say -- I don't know what the difference is, but they say it's not Alzheimer's, it's dementia, she has aortic stenosis, which is a clogging of the main artery.</sentence><sentence id="203">Blood doesn't flow to the brain too well, and she's really scared, and it's -- it's really rough right now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: The cake that you talked about, where she stole the egg.</sentence><sentence id="212">Do you eat cake today?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Yeah, I love cake, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Yellow cake?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Yellow cake, chocolate cake preferably, but when desperate, Ill eat yellow cake.</sentence><sentence id="220">And I love apricot jam, that was -- that went in it, and one of the other things we used to do,</sentence><sentence id="222">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0047 9 since food was scarce, we used to have these -- you know these kielbasa, it's like a hot dog, but it's like a salami texture, and it's very long and skinny, and I don't know how we acquired a piece, and my mother would cut one tiny, tiny little wedge, or circle, and cut it up into many, many, many pay -- many pieces, and pretend that that was a sandwich, or a piece of bread with it on.</sentence><sentence id="223">But instead of like eating the whole thing, it was rationed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: You still eat that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="234">The only thing that I don't eat, which really was sent to us after the war by my grandfather when they would send us care packages, is Spam.</sentence><sentence id="235">And I had -- We had no clue.</sentence><sentence id="236">They would send us Spam, and they sent nail polish, that they -- we would sell, and I don't know what other food product, but I adored ham, and the Spam had that kind of a taste.</sentence><sentence id="237">And we had, you know, never seen canned products before, so that was my very favorite, and I must tell you, when we came here, and I said Spam, everybody looked at me like thi -- and I always meant to buy Spam, and it's sort of like buying the "Enquirer," you're embarrassed to buy it, but you look at -- over somebody's shoulder at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">checkout counter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">But I've never bought it, and I always wondered if I bought it, what it would taste like today, but that was the only thing that I ate then, and I have not eaten since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: So clearly you didn't keep kosher.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="248">No, we were definitely -- I guess by Stateside standards, we would be Reform, but there it was Conservative.</sentence><sentence id="249">We sat separately, but it was -- we were not kosher, we did not</sentence><sentence id="251"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0047 10 speak Yiddish, my grandparents didn't speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="252">We were definitely assimilated upper middle class Hungarian Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Do you think that helped you when you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: You know, it's very hard to say.</sentence><sentence id="263">You -- You know, children fall into a lifestyle that they're in, and they don't say what would it have been like if I had been kosher, or -- or lived in -- I don't know, the <span class="REGION">lower east side</span>, or somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="264">I mean, the very first thing my parents did when we got here, is got tickets to Metropolitan Opera, cause that was their food.</sentence><sentence id="265">You know, we did bring some money, not a great deal, but we certainly weren't poor.</sentence><sentence id="266">But we probably spent more money on the opera than we did on food, because food we ate, but I had a very close friend, and I think I told that story, in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, whose father was a hairdresser, and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson Heights</span>, and every Sunday, they had roast beef, and this really expensive dinner.</sentence><sentence id="267">And we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="268">We had hot dogs, and beans, and I don't know, chicken or whatever, I mean, we didn't starve, but the quantity of food was not a major importance, but cultural activities were.</sentence><sentence id="269">So, you know, I don't know what it would have been like.</sentence><sentence id="270">I think I assimilated very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="271">We got here in the spring of "47, and I went to a very fancy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">girl's camp</span> in <span class="REGION">Maine</span>, that my daughter subsequently went to, that's still there, and if I had granddaughters, they'd be going there.</sentence><sentence id="272">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hunter High School</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">Hunter College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">And I never had any Hungarian friends, except for my parents and their friends.</sentence><sentence id="274">I spoke English, had no reason to speak anything else, and as I grew older, I started speaking English and Hungarian, kind of half and half.</sentence><sentence id="275">I started with one language and finished</sentence><sentence id="277"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0047 11 with the other with my parents.</sentence><sentence id="278">I mean, they spoke English with an accent, but they certainly spoke it well enough.</sentence><sentence id="279">And I married an American, and I had absolutely no reason, so I definitely assimilated, and I think maybe if I had been more religious, I would have assimilated differently, or not as easily.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Do you think of yourself as Jewish now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Absolutely, I always have.</sentence><sentence id="301">We converted for a short time, strictly for acquiring papers that they -- they thought may have saved our lives.</sentence><sentence id="302">It probably wouldn't have, but in those days you did everything that you could to -- just in case.</sentence><sentence id="303">Several of my parents friends, when they came here, remained whatever religion they converted to, and raised their children, whatever they were.</sentence><sentence id="304">I --I'm -- You know, I know them, but I -- they weren't -- I was not friendly with them, so I don't know if they were Catholic, or Protestant, or what they converted to, I really don't know, but one of my mother's friend's son is a minister.</sentence><sentence id="305">So -- And a lot of them intermarried.</sentence><sentence id="306">I married twice, both Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="307">I've always belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, we always observed the holidays -- holy days.</sentence><sentence id="308">My daughter was Confirmed, and married by a rabbi, and they are really quite -- well they're -- they belong to a <span class="BUILDING">Reform synagogue</span> also, but they are a very traditional Jewish family.</sentence></p></dialogue>

sometimes, people have said an awful lot of money is going to all these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, and all of this stuff, you know, isn't there better ways of spending the money, and sometimes I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="2217">But I think the only way to possibly avoid it, or to teach children in this crazy world, when you hear about all these shootings at <span

remember years ago, having meetings, and chairing a meeting, and giving a lecture to the people that are there, about not being late.</sentence><sentence id="2220">But the people that were there, were there.</sentence><sentence id="2221">The people that were that late, didn't hear my complaining, so I'm not sure that the people who are going to do terrible things, are going to go to the <span
