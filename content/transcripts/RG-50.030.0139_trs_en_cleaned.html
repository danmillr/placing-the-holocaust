<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Bill, between "36 when you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and 1940 do you feel that this was -- when you started to say this was the best time of your life up until then, it was a much more normal life for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is a very good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">It was a very good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> even more so then than now.</sentence><sentence id="336">Things have changed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="337">But the Dutch were just wonderful to us.</sentence><sentence id="338">And I felt it very strongly because I came from a very severe system of antisemitism and total separation from my surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span>, my surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> where I was born and where I grew up as a small boy.</sentence><sentence id="339">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I was accepted like an equal.</sentence><sentence id="340">I always remember that.</sentence><sentence id="341">The children in my class, the neighbors, that's like it should have been anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="342">But...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="352">Q: Then what happened in 1940 when the Germans came in, did it change radically?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it didn't change radically.</sentence><sentence id="355">It took about a year in general.</sentence><sentence id="356">Yah, there were, laws were made of course and we had to turn in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and there was a curfew at night for the Jews from 7:00 o'clock on.</sentence><sentence id="357">So not immediately, but very soon.</sentence><sentence id="358">Then of course we also couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any longer, to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> after about maybe eight, nine months to a year.</sentence><sentence id="359">So we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over which was a large community and they had built a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="360">They took one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> I think gave them and they made it into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">And we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> every morning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Were you frightened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Oh, sure.</sentence><sentence id="373">Because on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> we had to wear a star.</sentence><sentence id="374">And when the Germans came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, were public transportation systems, the rails were not running any longer.</sentence><sentence id="375">law.</sentence><sentence id="376">They had a bus system between all the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">And when Germans came in we had to get up and go in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">And if there were too many Germans they threw the Jewish kids out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, anyone with a star, they threw us out and we had to wait for the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">That happened once every other week maybe, sometimes more often.</sentence><sentence id="380">And then when we walked -- for instance when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I remember it was quite a way, it was maybe 45 minutes to an hour walk, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">And our classmates used to come by who lived there and picked us up on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span>, and they picked us up and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">And then they had to turn in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, it was the end of that transportation system.</sentence><sentence id="383">But it was good for me because we could continue our education, and they were good teachers, and that was the end of my education at that point.</sentence><sentence id="384">I had by then maybe six, seven years of elementary education from the first grade to the sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember the details.</sentence><sentence id="385">It's a little different in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> than it is here.</sentence><sentence id="386">Then at one point Jews could not be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> at all any longer.</sentence><sentence id="387">So my father thought, and because he was told that we couldn't sit at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> either that we had to keep busy, and my father called some acquaintances of his and I worked on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">I had to go every morning at 6:00, go to a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">I worked there in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> as a child.</sentence><sentence id="390">My father had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> still, but they were told that if you don't work you will be arrested earlier.</sentence><sentence id="391">So my father arranged that I went to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>

take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but there was a whole prelude of acts from turning in your radios to turning in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and your <span

my parents must have gone through to see number one, their own life destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="497">They had fought for the same <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was doing it to them.</sentence><sentence id="498">My father was very popular, and my mother, in the local community, the <span class="BUILDING">bowling clubs</span> and the veterans organizations.</sentence><sentence id="499">And then when their children their own life and their children, to me it must have been a horrible, horrible part of life for my mother to see what happened to her children.</sentence><sentence id="500">I mean there was no future.</sentence><sentence id="501">And where do you go if it goes downhill orchestrated by a government, not only by

was very nationalistic.</sentence><sentence id="505">He loved what he did because he was a veteran, he was wounded, he had medals from the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="506">And on Veterans

could pick the Jews out because they carried a cane as a substitute for a rifle.</sentence><sentence id="510">In those days we didn't think much about it because that's the way it

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2959">Q: Were the relationships among you as prisoners there, 3,600 you said, not that you had relations with 3,600 people, was it different than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: No comparison.</sentence><sentence id="2964">Much much easier.</sentence><sentence id="2965">It was easier.</sentence><sentence id="2966">But we were under the treat of being killed by selection.</sentence><sentence id="2967">We died because there was typhoid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> by the way, and I had typhoid, but a very mild case, and I wasn't in the Krankenbau, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> so-called.</sentence><sentence id="2968">But I got out not very much before when the Russians broke through and got out.</sentence><sentence id="2969">But I was in there for a while, not long.</sentence><sentence id="2970">And many died because there was typhoid in there.</sentence><sentence id="2971">That's why they kept shin the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2972">There were 3,600 left at that point.</sentence><sentence id="2973">And I think at one time there was probably close to 5,000 there.</sentence><sentence id="2974">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> replenished.</sentence><sentence id="2975">That number is -- but I know it was more than 3,600.</sentence><sentence id="2976">And he was told to kill them all.</sentence><sentence id="2977">And I'm told, and this is all hearsay, that the Polish underground who was watching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> very much so because they used to take, the Polish Resistance --brought them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and shut them in there with us -- on one <span class="DLF">wall</span> there and we had to turn them then.</sentence><sentence id="2978">The Polish underground allegedly told the Germans that if you kall all these people you'll never get out yourself, I'm told, because it was not difficult for them to do.</sentence><sentence id="2979">And we heard the rumblings of the big guns that was here already because the Russians were breaking through.</sentence><sentence id="2980">So one morning they had 300 in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> still, who couldn't get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2981">They shot them.</sentence><sentence id="2982">300, correct.</sentence><sentence id="2983">And 300 were kept there.</sentence><sentence id="2984">And the reason I know is because a fellow I was friendly with because he was my age, was a Berlin Jew, and he was selected to be and he had to stay there, that 300.</sentence><sentence id="2985">And those 300 were kept there to destroy all evidence, and they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="2986">That we were told later on.</sentence><sentence id="2987">I don't know how I know, but I know.</sentence><sentence id="2988">And because they were killed while we were marching out already, they just burned the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or dynamited.</sentence><sentence id="2989">It was done very very fast.</sentence><sentence id="2990">And 3,000 marched out, and we marched and we marched and I remember two things very distinctly.</sentence><sentence id="2991">Number one, that you tried not to be in the back because we heard the machine guns going constantly and we were told that anybody who drops out is going to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="2992">And they left their corpses right on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2993">So they had maybe four or five machine guns in the back of some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army truck</span> and they shot those people.</sentence><sentence id="2994">All men, there were no women there.</sentence><sentence id="2995">They were all men.</sentence><sentence id="2996">And we marched and here is the thing I remember as much as anything else, we came, it was in the summer, it was very hot, no water, and for some reason it rained once and we were going like this with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">soup pan</span> and we tried to catch the raindrops.</sentence><sentence id="2997">We were very very thirsty, almost to the point of sanity.</sentence><sentence id="2998">People were going insane, people were drinking their urine.</sentence><sentence id="2999">And all of a sudden we came over on a <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, and over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we saw a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3000">And they took us over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and there was a huge <span class="DLF">field</span> there, an open <span class="DLF">field</span> and we went in that <span class="DLF">field</span> apparently to stay overnight, but to wait for something.</sentence><sentence id="3001">And we pushed, the masses pushed so hard, and I happened to be in the earlier part of this grouping of 3,000.</sentence><sentence id="3002">Of course it was not 3,000 anymore, but I was in the first, maybe the second hundred or third hundred, very up front.</sentence><sentence id="3003">We got into this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, you could wade into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we drank and we drank and we drank.</sentence><sentence id="3004">But the masses in back of us were so anxious to get to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> they kept on pushing and they pushed us too far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> so we couldn't walk, and they wouldn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="3005">And the Germans didn't know what to do, so they thought that we would go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and escape.</sentence><sentence id="3006">So they start shooting from the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3007">They used machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="3008">They shot.</sentence><sentence id="3009">And I remember, because I wake up often, that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> turned as red as blood.</sentence><sentence id="3010">And the Jews wouldn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="3011">Our people would not stop.</sentence><sentence id="3012">They kept on pushing from the back.</sentence><sentence id="3013">And they couldn't stop the Jew and these people.</sentence><sentence id="3014">On the <span class="REGION">German side</span>, they kept killing with bullets and they brought the dogs 0 in.</sentence><sentence id="3015">And the people in charge made those soldiers, those German SS go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> with the dogs and when the dogs got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> the Jews stopped.</sentence><sentence id="3016">They wouldn't stop for the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="3017">That I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And then they stopped pushing.</sentence><sentence id="3019">I was out by then.</sentence><sentence id="3020">Because, you know, I got out because they pushed and it came up to here in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so I got out.</sentence><sentence id="3021">None of us could swim.</sentence><sentence id="3022">I don't know how many could swim.</sentence><sentence id="3023">I know I couldn't swim.</sentence><sentence id="3024">I told you I couldn't go to the swim because I was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3025">They never taught me how to swim.</sentence><sentence id="3026">So the soil was just bodies and blood, and I could only think about why they called it the Red Sea.</sentence><sentence id="3027">There's no connection there, but it was red as pure blood.</sentence><sentence id="3028">And they killed a lot.</sentence><sentence id="3029">They killed, in my estimation, at least 1,000 people there, maybe more.</sentence><sentence id="3030">No one knows.</sentence><sentence id="3031">But there were very few who got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3032">And I don't remember if we walked much more, but in the end we got in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>.</sentence><sentence
