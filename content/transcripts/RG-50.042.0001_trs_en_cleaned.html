<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Wait, we have to stop, there's a noise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Yeah, I jumped ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: Saw people with flowers and cameras, walking up the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">You know, our <span class="DLF">street</span> was called Shishinska, which means uh, like uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, which was the <span class="DLF">street</span> which led to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span>, and people were walking up that <span class="DLF">street</span>, and my mother said something like, "Oh my God, I hope they are not...," and at this point that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> came down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, was an incredible roar, came down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and was two German military in them, and uh, the thing which I remember most vividly, my brother had his wristwatch in his pocket, and he was just removing it from his pocket, and so, his hand must have trembled because his watch fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and I remember seeing, it, it was 9:10 in the morning, and I was sort of thinking that something that, that was the moment when, when our world was gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: Tell me about the woman who wanted your Polish ---------.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Uh, well, we um, we realized that things were uh, what, what was most astonishing thing is that uh, we heard roars of uh people, our neighbors, and friends and people I've known all my life, you know.</sentence><sentence id="79">My mother was born in the same <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was born, and you know, it's been in the family I don't know for how many generations, and, uh, uh people were shouting you know, "Heil Hitler!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="82">Long live the Fuehrer," and, and, and, and people were waving flags with Swastikas and uh, there was a feeling of complete betrayal, sud-suddenly you were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and, and you were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="83">You know, I mean, uh it was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you know, and we, we love <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was uh, uh at least a young generation, you know because the older generation had grown up, up under <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, but of course, we were born under <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and uh, this is something I couldn't understand and, and probably uh the most, the most vivid example of that was that my friend Trudy, who uh had a ve-a very bitter life and her mother had died, and she had a stepfather, her mother married a, a that man went through, there was very little, he was terribly cruel to her, and he was beating her, and she spent so much time with us, was a, a, you know, and I, I really felt oh so close to her, and I saw her going to our <span class="DLF">garden</span> and picking white roses.</sentence><sentence id="84">My mother was particularly proud of them because they had bloomed out of season and, and she was handing it to a sold--to a German soldier, you know, and people were bringing, and, and, and I think that gesture always sticks in my mind as, as one of complete betrayal, and also I remember her handing the roses to the soldier who is reaching out to her, and at that moment, someone else was handing him a glass of Schnapps, or what, you know, it was some sort of whiskey, and he let the roses fall to, to, to, to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and people were trampling on my roses, and um, uh, I don't know it, it's sort of like it became a symbol for me, that very moment, it's arrested in my mind that uh, what, what was happening there, that everything was sort of upside down, and um...I don't know.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Tell me about the neighbor who wanted -----------.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Then there was a woman, you know people, how people try to be helpful, I, I don't mean to uh, uh to say that um, that it was a direct betrayal of us, at that particular point it was not, but of...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: Stop.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Four is up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Beep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Of course we, we had some very good and very close friends among our neighbors, and uh, one woman, her name was uh Frau Resher, I remember, she came in, and she asked where the Polish Flag was.</sentence><sentence id="99">The Polish flag, of course, is uh, a strip of white and a strip of red, very long strips, and my mother said, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="100">And she said, it's really very easy to make a German flag out of it, you know, all you have to do is um cut out around um thing of the from the white and then pose it on the, on the red, and then with a ribbon, make the swastika, you know, I, and my mother absolutely turned pale, and the woman said, "We we better make that flag and fly from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you know, obviously she wanted to protect us because uh, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which did not fly uh the swastika flag uh were under scrutiny, and uh, they figured that they were you know, anti-German, and they discovered that we were Jewish so uh, she just took the flag, my mother looked for it in all <span class="NPIP">places</span> where she knew she couldn't find it, but finally she did produce it and uh, and she did make, my mother did not, but the neighbor and another one made the flag, and uh, and it was sort of unbelievable to see uh that flag flying from my <span class="BUILDING">childhood home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">I remember I thought of it like a spider, you know the swastika sort of reaching out to, to engulf us, and uh, was a horrible thing, something that was supposed to be for our protection was actually terribly ------------- particularly, you know, to a young girl, and it all came so fast, it was all, within a day.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: The war started in September.</sentence><sentence id="120">By, by Christmas we had to move to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">It was very cold and clammy.</sentence><sentence id="122">We, we had no, no running water, no electricity, and uh, things were really quite bad, but we were still in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">Uh, and spring was very difficult because I always loved my <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">I used to spend a lot of time there as a child, and the sign appeared there, that dogs and Jews were not permitted to enter.</sentence><sentence id="125">Um, when we had orders to move to uh, Shabby??a remote corner of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which became the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, uh, I defied that order.</sentence><sentence id="126">I remember I, I said, "I don't care what they're going to do."</sentence><sentence id="127">I had to see my <span class="DLF">garden</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="128">Was a beautiful, fragrant spring morning, was in April, and uh, I remember I jumped over the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and went to the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and pretended that uh, that I was just, I was picking violets, and I pretended just for a little bit, what it would be like if uh, if the war hadn't happened, if I would be going in, my mother would say L, I need to take my raincoat to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my brother would be hurrying off, my father would be going to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, my mother would be setting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> for breakfast, and urging us to -----------, and uh, I remember it was sort of the most incredible thing that um, uh the reality which I had always taken for granted, now became uh the most remote fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="129">I then, I think it stayed with me you know, in a way, throughout all the years to, to return to that.</sentence><sentence id="130">Later, of course, it took on other forms of um, when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, to imagining evening at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but here I still was looking at my <span class="BUILDING">childhood home</span>, <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my parents were <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, my brother had been taken away, um, maybe six weeks after the war started, he was taken away October 19th, and the war broke out the first of September, but I was with my parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I could, I could see from the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which had been mine, the wallpaper, um, even though we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, I was still there, and, and yet um, I somehow must have been at least subconsciously aware that maybe I'm never come back, so I'd never recognize it, you know, I, I lived throughout with this thing, I'm going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, always, but uh, when I look back now over, over the many years, uh, and I, I still can very vividly recall my feeling, it, uh, it was sort of a farewell to, to my life and to my childhood, and I was sixteen at that point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, tell me about some of things you remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: Well, you know, as much as I dreaded going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, um, actually in some ways, it was a little easier for me because my friends were there, you know, I was not as isolated as I had been at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, when we had curfew and I could see my friends only at a certain time, and it was dangerous to go out anyway, but still we were uh, I was closer to my friends, so um, that somewhat compensated for, for the treatment so, so you know in, in, in every little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> another tragedy played.</sentence><sentence id="147">Um, and then we had to work, um, and uh, in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badovitz</span>, they had the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> there, where they were sewing uniforms for, I guess for the army, and we were</sentence><sentence id="149">marched, my, my mother and I and all, all went.</sentence><sentence id="150">Of course, you know, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were almost no men, there were mostly women and children, older people.</sentence><sentence id="151">My father, uh, was one of the few because he had had that heart attack and he was permitted to stay but he had to work in the, also in the nearby little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to fortify the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suhar</span>, and uh we were terribly worried every morning that might be daybreak, 4 or 5 0 clock that he'd left because he had a heart condition, and we were afraid what that hard labor will, will do to him, and uh, my mother and I and some of my friends who few blessedly are still alive, um had to go to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baravitz</span> to work in, in that uh, <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> sewing.</sentence><sentence id="152">We left in the morning and came back late at night and then the whole thing started again, and actually I uh, I, I think the discipline was, was pretty good, you know you are so tired, you worked so hard that uh you did not get too much time to reflect of, of what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="153">At least for me it was, I'm sure it was much more difficult for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="154">And, and then well, um, -----------------from 1939 uh till the worst day of my life, the 28th of June, 42.</sentence><sentence id="155">Um, that is when I saw my father for the last time, the following day my mother.</sentence><sentence id="156">We were told to assemble.</sentence><sentence id="157">Uh, the day before um, we were, I uh, I heard my parents, of course, you know we all lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I heard my parents talk through that night, and I still cannot comprehend their incredible bravery.</sentence><sentence id="158">They spoke only of, of their lives together, of their love, their good times, their children, their parents, and with that they faced the morning.</sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know, it sort of became uh, perhaps my own defense, I always felt, you know and thinks got-------------and volunteers???that I had to emulate my parents.</sentence><sentence id="160">If they could do it, I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="161">And then I must, you know, never disappoint them, I knew that that if they return and, and I thought, those things are, these, I thought when they return, I will never will say, you know, I will, I will show them that I um, that I'll come back, I'll do everything to come back to them because I remember how, how horrible it was for them when my brother left.</sentence><sentence id="162">Blessedly they never knew that my brother did not return.</sentence><sentence id="163">But, you know, that was the daily conversation, when Arthur comes back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="164">And I felt that, you know, I owed it to them to, to stay alive, no matter what, and not give them the pain of that loss.</sentence><sentence id="165">And however, you know we had, of course I always had a great --------------, so I was not particularly religious, I had a great deal of respect for religion and books, and um, one of the things I wanted to do after I said goodbye to my father, I wanted to I, I knew what would happen in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you see my father was taken away on Sunday the 28th of June, and um, I asked a friend of mine to go with me and collect uh prayer books, you know, I, I was afraid when they'll find it, they'll probably use it for toilet tissue or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="166">And we dragged, was a rainy day, and we dragged those books out to little <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which was adjacent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and an old uh <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, we took the books there, we, we couldn't really bury them, but we sort of stashed them on one of those where they were um, I, I guess were, were some cottons and things where apparently I, I don't remember that too well, but I know that this is how we first tried to bury some of them, and that sort of, you know, if it's a decency of, of, of a burial.</sentence><sentence id="167">I would rather night recall</sentence><sentence id="169">the night the last night which I spent with my mother which was a very bitter, and then in the morning, you know, very, very early in the morning, uh, came the final moment.</sentence><sentence id="170">Uh, when they tushed through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with their whips and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="171">My poor mother, you know, my brother left on a Monday, and he left it 3 years prior to that.</sentence><sentence id="172">And my mother fasted every Monday, sort of atoning, I don't know for what.</sentence><sentence id="173">Uh, probably begging God if she's going to fast that my brother will return, and that was also on a Monday, and I, I remember I begged her to have something to eat and she wouldn't, but she had also uh, saved from before the war, a bit of cocoa, and uh, and some jam, and she decided to make that cocoa for me that morning.</sentence><sentence id="174">I remember it, she was looking at that cocoa with great longing, we didn't have any throughout.</sentence><sentence id="175">But, it didn't taste particularly sweet on that morning.</sentence><sentence id="176">We had to march through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and um, my...I guess it's a sort of a similar journey than a journey to execution when I think of it now because, you know, you saw people looking out from behind <span class="DLF">curtains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">Some waving sort of a mute farewell, uh, seeing uh somebody was painting a new sign on a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">The movie was putting on a new feature on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">marquee</span>, and uh, and we were marching.</sentence><sentence id="179">Ah.</sentence><sentence id="180">Was an SS man there that turned, that was near the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> where the circus used to come, was sort of a an empty <span class="NPIP">place</span>, accommodating all kinds of things as a circus before, and now sort of a tragedy of ------------nature.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="230">I, I was with my mother, and a number of my friends, who were with their mothers, and um, we heard that Marin was there.</sentence><sentence id="231">Um, Marin was um, a man of um, uh, if the stories to be believe of uh, not anyone to, to be greatly admired.</sentence><sentence id="232">Um, a man apparently of a little character, what have you, he was called an opportunist, and uh, this opportunity was presented to him that he uh was, was working with uh, with the government there.</sentence><sentence id="233">The story also had that he uh he had a child, a little daughter whom apparently he adored, and that he would do anything in order to save that child, and um, the Nazis apparently gave him that opportunity that if he would be helpful to interpret or get people to come there, his child would be saved.</sentence><sentence id="234">That was the story, I don't know how, how much truth that was in it.</sentence><sentence id="235">But I saw him, he was a, a very small sort of sour-looking man and it was, it was raining but it was oppressively hot because it was the end of June, and he was</sentence><sentence id="237">wearing a sleek raincoat, and uh, and then of course there were the Germans in uniforms, the Nazis, the SS, he was standing to the side, we had to form a <span class="DLF">line</span>, and an SS man stood there with um, with a little stick and um, I was holding hands with my mother, I came up to him, and he says, "How old?"</sentence><sentence id="238">I said, "18," and he sort of pushed me to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and my mother to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">I, I wasn't aware what was happening at that particular point, but shortly thereafter, when I stood with my other friends who were also separated from their mothers, we realized that we were going to go to separate <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">There was <span class="DLF">enclosure</span>, an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> there, this barbed wire, to, to the right where our mothers were, and we were immediately taken to, to the left.</sentence><sentence id="241">Now again, I, I don't remember the time sequence at all.</sentence><sentence id="242">I just remember a tremendous panic and uh, and shortly thereafter some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived, uh, open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with, with sort of a <span class="DLF">gate</span> behind it, and we were loading in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and uh, I heard my mother's voice and I thought ask, "Where to?"</sentence><sentence id="243">and I shouted back, "I don't know."</sentence><sentence id="244">And, I guess I must have been aware that that I was taken away from my mother so I jumped off, and Marin came, and he was very slight, small man, | didn't expect such strength in him, and he picked me up bodily and he threw me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he says, "You are too young to die."</sentence><sentence id="245">And, uh, I guess, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were set in motion, again, I tried, I don't remember the, the time sequence and uh, I just heard my mother's voice over the entire uh, over crying and everything, and it came like an echo and she was saying, you know, "Be strong," you know, "-------," in German.</sentence><sentence id="246">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> rolled out of there, and, ironically the, the sun came out sort of um, I still see it, the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span> looked wet, illuminated by the sun, and the church bells were ringing, and that was the last view.</sentence><sentence id="247">We were taken to...were taken to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and of course, I was with my friends, and I think we, we all started talking and facing the reality what was probably happening, and I remember rejecting it completely, thinking it cannot be, you know.</sentence><sentence id="248">Uh, they're going to be all right, and frankly, that kept me going all those years.</sentence><sentence id="249">They have to be all right.</sentence><sentence id="250">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnovitch</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Uh, you see our part, it belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> before the first world war.</sentence><sentence id="252">This is why we were German-speaking, this was quite early, this was 1942 and 42, and um, and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span>, your names, your ages, and the places you hail from were registered.</sentence><sentence id="253">I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlitz</span>, which was a well-known textile center, they called it the Manchester of <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span>, and the people would come from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were in need of labor.</sentence><sentence id="254">The men were in the army, the women were given responsible positions, and they needed slave labor, however they needed people who could understand German and speak German.</sentence><sentence id="255">So, we were ina - ---------------position.</sentence><sentence id="256">And a man came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kramstamatnaphronic</span>???,</sentence><sentence id="257">which was a very large textile um center I guess, or maybe many <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he bought us for that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to be slaves, and, but, in that --------------, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span>, I think I came face to face for the first time with the concept of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, to which of course, slave labor concentration, we were because uh, shipments came with girls from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who were either named -------------, and that was um, the last stop before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and I met those girls, and I remember my first contact was</sentence><sentence id="259">probably the first evening when we when we stood, um, in <span class="DLF">line</span> to get some food out of you know -- --------aluminum bowls, you know, we used to feed our dogs out of bowls like that, and I didn't understand when that bowl was given to my hand, what to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="260">And then we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span>, and I got some food, and uh, I remember putting a spoon in and scraping because there was sand in the bottom, you know, and I saw this girl was you know, her hair was uh very short shorn hair, and she had enormous eyes, she was emaciated, and she looked sort of hungry, and I asked if she wanted it, and she looked at me as if I gave her the greatest treasure, and she said, "Yes," she said, "Aren't you hungry," and I said, "No," and she was sort of silhouetted against, uh, this <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and she sort of gave a benediction when, when she get it, and then she handed me an, an empty bowl and I, I didn't understand, and she said, "You know, if I, we found with two bowls, I'll be beaten that I stole it."</sentence><sentence id="261">She gave me that that bowl, and that was sort of the first impact of things to come.</sentence><sentence id="262">I uh was with a very close friend of mine, Ilsa, who was like a sister to me, we had grown up together, and a number of my other friends, and there I met people who became my best friend's family to each other, my friend Liesl, my friend, Susie.</sentence><sentence id="263">One was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and the other one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">We became very close friends, and we were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkoreim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">And um, strangely enough, on, on that ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sosnovitz</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, um, there was a certain lightness which I remember , and uh, I can identify it now as um, the worst has happened, and as, as tragic as it was to be separated from my parents, in a way it was um almost you know, some of my fear left me there.</sentence><sentence id="266">You know, I was always afraid that I would see something, you know, and I once saw an SS man beat my father, and, I mean those were the most horrible things.</sentence><sentence id="267">And to see my parents concern about me and their concern about each other.</sentence><sentence id="268">Now I knew that uh whatever would happen would happen to me, and uh, for some reason, I was really not afraid any longer.</sentence><sentence id="269">When I was with young girls, we went together, and then it was, was almost um something lighthearted that that happened there, and um, and I think that in itself um, I think it, it, it's much easier to bear whatever happens to you alone, not to watch someone you love, to, it's happening to them, and also to see their, their concern and pain when it's inflicted on you.</sentence><sentence id="270">This is why I think perhaps it was so much more difficult for people uh that had to suffer together.</sentence><sentence id="271">And of course, youth, you know, also is uh, you know, is resilient, that, at that point I was 18, and uh, then of course, I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for 3 years.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Oh sure.</sentence><sentence id="411">You know, I mean, look, she demanded certain things, I mean I don't want to give you the impression that you know she was too--we worked very hard, you know we were, we were taught to weave, and uh, the work was very difficult, and uh, you know, you had to be very swift and that because uh, the material which we were weaving, you know, was, was very poor.</sentence><sentence id="412">The threads would break, and everything was interpreted as a sabotage.</sentence><sentence id="413">If you didn't work it like, uh skilled uh weavers would have 2 looms, we had 4 looms to watch.</sentence><sentence id="414">I mean, it was hard uh, uh backbreaking labor, but uh, but we still had some food, I mean uh you know, you, you didn't, you, you would consider it dreadful under normal circumstances, but of what was to follow later, I, I think of that as a transition period you know from uh from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and from, from love and from normalcy to, to the horror which followed, I, I think that uh that she made it bearable, you know.</sentence><sentence id="415">She did not steal any of our food.</sentence><sentence id="416">We, we got the food uh you know.</sentence><sentence id="417">If somebody was ill, as I mentioned, I was at that particular time, she let you stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="418">She, she, she really tried.</sentence><sentence id="419">She was a human being, and uh, and I think it was terribly important to meet a human being under those, those circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="420">You know, to a lot of people, I believe that um a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> seems like a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> where people step on each other for survival, they stole from each other.</sentence><sentence id="421">That wasn't the case at all.</sentence><sentence id="422">And again, I speak only about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in which I was.</sentence><sentence id="423">And um, and I can say that I have seen the finest qualities of

know, and on Sunday we sometimes got margarine on our bread.</sentence><sentence id="425">We would scrape the margarine off on Sunday from several of the pieces to save it for the person who had the birthday, to honor birthday, put some margarine on the bread, and, and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="426">My closest friend, Ilsa of whom I speak so often once found a raspberry in the ----- ----, and she carried it in her pocket all day long, through a hot day, a raspberry, a total possession.</sentence><sentence id="427">And that night she reached out and through the barbed wire, and got a leaf and washed it, and she presented the ra-raspberry on a leaf.</sentence><sentence id="428">It was her total possession, and people did some wonderful things there, and those are the things that I want to remember.</sentence><sentence id="429">You know, and we had very little time, of course, you know, and most, most of the time we were very tired.</sentence><sentence id="430">Whatever free time we had, but that was used if somebody remembered of seeing a, a particular film or ballet or something, it was shared, and you know, and an acted out, and um, oh there, there was an</sentence><sentence id="432">enormous support system there, and um, it, it that really was the, the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to survival, that on one hand we experienced extreme cruelty, and on the other hand, incredible love and friendship, and there was a balance there, and there was hope there, you know.</sentence><sentence id="433">And somehow you um, you know, you saw of, of them, the Nazis like um, you know, I, I would fantasize to, to look like a snake or this and that, I mean you didn't think of them as human, but you could identify the others as human being.</sentence><sentence id="434">| always thought of them as below my contempt, you know, and this is how you could somehow take it.</sentence><sentence id="435">Sometimes, of course, you fell under the spell of it, you know, when they would march you out and, and tell you that you'll be here all your life and this and that, and I always said, you know, you can fall under that, you know, you have to imagine how uh, how they will look dead and things like that, you know, and I was spinning fantasies, and, and that helped.</sentence><sentence id="436">Now again, you know, you, you have to be very young at that time or with a very vivid imagination, which fortunately I had so um, you know, I, I could sort of often lift myself out of that and imagine different things, and, and almost, almost anything could conjure this type of picture sometimes, you know the um, I remember you know working on the looms and we had overhead lights and the way um sometimes the light fell on the loom, I could remember that light coming through to my <span class="DLF">window</span> in the morning when I was a child waking up, and then I could build a whole picture around that and black out everything that was around me.</sentence><sentence id="437">And I lived sort of in, in a world, you know, you could live on 2 levels, there's, there's no problem about that.</sentence><sentence id="438">And I guess even now I do live on two <span class="INT_SPACE">levels</span>, you know, sometimes the other one comes up and makes it a little more difficult when uh, when that intrudes, but

long="16.019942">Landeshut</span>, and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span>, and so and we were send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span> was a horrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> by comparison with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">First of all we were housed in, in a <span class="BUILDING">bldg</span> maybe on the 6th or 7th or 8th floor, way up and it was terribly hot there, it was middle of the summer.</sentence><sentence id="601">And of course the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were nailed down, I mean, we were literally broiling there, and the people in charge there were in complete contrast to what we knew about Frau Kigler.</sentence><sentence id="602">There was a Lager Feuhrer in there, who was perhaps 18 or 19 years old, the most vulgar-looking thing.</sentence><sentence id="603">Uh, she was wearing rings on every finger, and then sometimes 2 or 3 rings on each finger, and she had short stubby red hands, and her enjoyment was to, she had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, like children right around, and she would sit in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a little whip, and we had to um pull her.</sentence><sentence id="604">That was her, her joy, I mean, the mentality of that person was, was not to be believed.</sentence><sentence id="605">And then there was another person there, who was in charge of us, and she had been um, a guard in one of the female um <span class="BUILDING">jails</span>, and we sometimes had, and the work that we did, um, people who were, who committed some, some sort of misdemeanor or what have you, in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, came to spend a day working with us.</sentence><sentence id="606">And that was our normal work.</sentence><sentence id="607">Um, we worked at different jobs there.</sentence><sentence id="608">Um, one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jobs</span>, which was uh dreadful.</sentence><sentence id="609">There were several that were bad.</sentence><sentence id="610">One was to um hand a bricks one to another, and we were to throw the brick and, and catch it quickly.</sentence><sentence id="611">If you didn't, it landed on your hands, and uh, it crushed your fingers.</sentence><sentence id="612">The other job was to go in a nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> because they were growing linen there, and in the <span class="DLF">swamp</span>, you had to put um, uh, the li--the not finished linen, the thing that had grown into the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> to because then it opened, uh, the <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> in which the threads, the lin--, the linen was--I don't know if I'm explaining it right--that was backbreaking labor.</sentence><sentence id="613">You had to stand in the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> doing that, and that's was swarming with mosquitoes, and then other thing that we did is uh load into a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span>, an enormous <span class="BUILDING">silo</span>, I don't know how many stories high, um, a man with a crane was throwing down bundles, and we were standing on that, and you know the bundles uh, came crashing down, and you had to arrange them, and you could easily be swallowed up in that, first of all, you were swaying all the time, and uh, and then</sentence><sentence id="615">they came so fast that if you didn't catch it fast enough, it hit you and it pricked your skin, and then, then your skin was bleeding, and then you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span>, and the mosquitoes were eating in it.</sentence><sentence id="616">It was a horrible time, and it was there in that <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> where some of the women came from <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> who had committed murder or God knows what, as punishment for a day, and they said they preferred solitary anytime than to work there.</sentence><sentence id="617">Um, it was there as a matter of fact where I uh, really felt I was going to give up.</sentence><sentence id="618">There was one overseer who uh was particularly cruel to me, and he had singled me out for uh for this type of punishment.</sentence><sentence id="619">So, during the day, I was working with flax or uh ----------the bundles.</sentence><sentence id="620">At night we had to shovel coal.</sentence><sentence id="621">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, uh you know, came loaded with coal, we had to shovel it because <span class="DLF">tracks</span> had to be cleared, and it was going on day and night.</sentence><sentence id="622">Once we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going by we didn't' know if there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with uh with German soldiers going back, and people said there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> of people we sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">And um, and I remember my resistance really weakening there, and I thought to myself once after the um, the cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was empty and I was with that, standing on that, with that shovel in my hand, and I, I said it would be so easy now to jump.</sentence><sentence id="624">An oncoming <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and it would be over in, in a couple seconds, and become a part of that stillness like we have to face tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="625">It's, it's going to be tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="626">It's going to be flax in the morning and, and the bundles at night, and, and the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> again, and the hunger, and that I, I, I just felt I had enough.</sentence><sentence id="627">And I, I resisted that, and then, another day came by and the next night it uh, and I remember too, you know, I had promised my father, there was one thing I was never going to, to do is, is to really give up.</sentence><sentence id="628">It was sort of a, but, but there I came very close to doing it, and I remember that one night, when I definitely saw that it was a beautiful moonlit night, and I said to myself, "It's time to do it."</sentence><sentence id="629">And I heard very faint oncoming of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, very far away probably.</sentence><sentence id="630">And suddenly I felt a pain in my both sides of my, my neck, very sharp, and um, it was right in the beginning of the war when we not heard from my brother and my mother was sick, and we were told that we had to leave with 20 lbs of our belongings.</sentence><sentence id="631">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="632">And I remember standing there, and we heard of a family who committed suicide together, and I sort of half-wished that my parents had suggested that.</sentence><sentence id="633">I was also very close to my father, and I remember I stood there, and was thinking about that.</sentence><sentence id="634">My father must have guessed my thoughts because he came up to me, stood behind me and he said, "What you are thinking is, is cowardly and is wrong."</sentence><sentence id="635">And he said, "Promise me that you are never going to do it."</sentence><sentence id="636">I didn't answer him.</sentence><sentence id="637">And he took my head, as he stood behind me and he turned me back forcefully toward him.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Uh, very early in the war while we were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, as a matter of fact, we were still living in, in our own <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="708">It was shortly after my brother was taken away.</sentence><sentence id="709">And my, my mother was really gone to pieces.</sentence><sentence id="710">She was quite ill.</sentence><sentence id="711">And my father had the recurring, recurring thing with his heart.</sentence><sentence id="712">And we got orders to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with 20 pounds of our belongings, and my father told me to sort of pack suitcases, I had no idea how to do that.</sentence><sentence id="713">And I, we had heard of a family who committed suicide together, and uh J, I really thought at that point that that, that would be good, to do that, and I had hoped that my parents would suggest that.</sentence><sentence id="714">And I remember standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and thinking about that.</sentence><sentence id="715">And my father came up behind me, and uh he, he always knew what I was thinking and he, he said to me, "What what you were thinking is, is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="716">It's cowardly, it's, it's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="717">He said, "You promise me never to do that no matter what."</sentence><sentence id="718">And I didn't answer him, and then he, he sort of took me, he took my head, like that, and he turned it toward me, toward him, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want your promise now.</sentence><sentence id="719">And I said, "Papa I promise."</sentence><sentence id="720">And uh, during those last days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Medsdorf</span>, that promise became pretty faint.</sentence><sentence id="721">I, I, I was, I was exhausted, you know, I don't know how, uh anymore, how many days and nights I, I was working in that heat, in, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span>, and uh, and the cold, and the just everything -------- together, and I, I, I really wanted to, to end it.</sentence><sentence id="722">And at that precise moment when I really most decided it, I mean, I don't know if I would have carried it through or not, but I have a feeling that I that I was pretty much at the, at the end of my rope there.</sentence><sentence id="723">And I knew that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going to come, and I figured, I, I'm going to jump.</sentence><sentence id="724">Suddenly I felt that very sharp pain in my neck.</sentence><sentence id="725">And the promise came back, and obviously I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="726">Strange thing is, the following day, everything changed.</sentence><sentence id="727">The following as we were working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span>, um, that overseer, that that fury came running and had a list in her hand, and asked the people who had the following numbers to come forward.</sentence><sentence id="728">And I, I, I think my mind must have been so muddled, I wasn't even thinking, um, and Ilsa's number was called, she was working with me.</sentence><sentence id="729">See, Ilsa was not working nights, uh, at that was sort of directed more against me or, or a few other people, and he called Ilsa's number, and nobody rai-raised their hands, and she said, "Well who has that number?"</sentence><sentence id="730">And Ilsa took my hand and she said, "She did."</sentence><sentence id="731">I wasn't even aware of what she was doing.</sentence><sentence id="732">She obviously was substituting her number for mine.</sentence><sentence id="733">She wanted to save me from something.</sentence><sentence id="734">And I was led away, and Ilsa jumped out of -------, and she also started running, and as we came to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, there stood the director of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span>, and uh, Ilsa literally threw herself at, at his feet, and she said, "I want to go with my sister."</sentence><sentence id="735">So he said, "What is your number?"</sentence><sentence id="736">Then she</sentence><sentence id="738">gave her correct number and mine, and he said, "Well you both are on the list."</sentence><sentence id="739">So he said, "You run and wash up you, you look like pigs," uh, and actually what was happening is they needed more people for weaving and he came to collect from this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was not a <span class="BUILDING">weaving factory</span>, to an adjacent one called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshoot</span>, which was also under the auspices of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boltonheim</span>, and uh, again we were loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I couldn't wait for the <span class="DLF">gates</span> to open, to get out of that, I, I didn't know how to thank Ilsa for it, but I remember that I, I just said to her, "I'm glad I didn't jump."</sentence><sentence id="740">And she said, "What did you say?"</sentence><sentence id="741">And I said, "I'll tell you someday."</sentence><sentence id="742">I never told her.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: Um, I, I can only surmise um I, I was cleaning some, some small component in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and, and he came up--he, he wasn't a lager fuehrer, he was, he was um, sort of a supervisor there.</sentence><sentence id="784">And he said to me, "Um how, how would you like some hot soup or some bread?"</sentence><sentence id="785">You know, which was sort of, I said, well, I said to myself, "Why is he saying that to me?"</sentence><sentence id="786">If he wanted to help me, why doesn't he give me a piece of bread?"</sentence><sentence id="787">You know.</sentence><sentence id="788">So, I sort of said, uh, "Well, I eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>," which I felt, you know, was, was stating the truth without accusing them that they're not giving us enough to eat, but, but not saying anything, and so I uh, I gathered that he had maybe a certain designs on me, or maybe just wanting to test me, I don't know, you know, they were, well, that, incidentally, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not much of a problem.</sentence><sentence id="789">There were a lot, uh, there were very few men around working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, were mostly old, and there were a lot of young pretty German girls there, so that was, that was not a problem.</sentence><sentence id="790">I, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="791">In any event, I think, just the type of defiance that I showed, uh he decided to sort of break my spirit, maybe out of sport or, or just to show his ------------, and this is what I was picked for.</sentence><sentence id="792">For every type of, of hard work.</sentence><sentence id="793">But um, I think it's a terribly important lesson.</sentence><sentence id="794">One should never ever, ever give up.</sentence><sentence id="795">No matter how difficult a thing is you know, uh, giving up is a final solution to a temporary problem.</sentence><sentence id="796">Our problem wasn't so temporary.</sentence><sentence id="797">Nevertheless, it would pass, but one was keenly aware of the preciousness of life, and to hold on to it as long as possible, and to me, this was really the most important thing, and I would say that during that entire time that I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was a little, 1 mean, except for the beginning of the war when I really did not know, and only heard that the family had chosen that <span class="DLF">path</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="798">This was the only incident that I remember, through all the years, that I really came close to calling it quits.</sentence><sentence id="799">That's why I love to say to young people, never ever, ever give up.</sentence><sentence id="800">The darker the night, the brighter the dawn, and it sure was bright.</sentence><sentence id="801">And it sure was dark.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="878">A: Sort of getting a little...Well...three years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became progressively worse as um, raw material was running out, and also as uh it seemed that the war was taking a different turn.</sentence><sentence id="879">We sort of knew that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> should be victorious, our doom is going to be sealed.</sentence><sentence id="880">But if, for what we prayed for that, that we would be liberated, we were afraid that when things start turning uh bad for them, they are going to let uh their, their venom and their frustrations out on us, so that was really a no win situation.</sentence><sentence id="881">It became pretty obvious in the winter of 1944 as it turned to 45, when um, uh there were fr-a frequent um we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming in and, and uh, uh production stopped, and things were, were getting bad, and then on the night of the 28th, rather the day of the 28th of January, 45, we did not go to work.</sentence><sentence id="882">Was a workday, and we did not go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">We were told to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="884">And toward evening we heard an enormous commotion, and uh, a transport of 2000 girls came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, mostly Hungarian girls.</sentence><sentence id="885">They told us they had been marching, that um, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, uh the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> had moved closer, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was being liberated, and they were running away from the advancing Russian

id="888">Was in January.</sentence><sentence id="889">And I was coughing terribly, I had a very bad cold.</sentence><sentence id="890">And my 3 dearest friends, Susie Kuhns, Lizzy Schteburn, Ilsa Klein Zeller and I, we hurried together the four of us, and they, they were very concerned about me, they said, "You know, if you can only pull through with that terrible cold and the terrible cough," like the pneumonia or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="891">And in the morning, very early, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, not to the type of freedom we had hoped, but it opened to an, an incredible picture.</sentence><sentence id="892">There was freshly fallen snow for as far as the eye could see.</sentence><sentence id="893">And an enormous sort of it was a <span class="DLF">plateau</span>, and then it came up to, to a gentle <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and it</sentence><sentence id="895">was just, just covered with snow.</sentence><sentence id="896">It was grey, it was snowing, and uh we were told to uh assemble for a -----------, so of course, there was the four of us, and uh we held hands, and we took the first step, and I guess we all knew that this was going to be the first step to the end of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">Either to liberation or to, to doom.</sentence><sentence id="898">And in front of us stretched this incredible <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="899">Well, people looked you know with, with grey uh camp blankets over them, and they looked like winged death.</sentence><sentence id="900">That's all you could see.</sentence><sentence id="901">Way, way ahead, four thousand girls.</sentence><sentence id="902">And on the side were the SS men and the SS women, and they lifted their whips and they said, "Forward march."</sentence><sentence id="903">And we started to march.</sentence><sentence id="904">Started to march, it was the 29th of January.</sentence><sentence id="905">And we, we left a lot of girls back in the snow.</sentence><sentence id="906">And they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="907">That was something one can barely, can really not describe.</sentence><sentence id="908">My father had asked me when I last saw him in June the very last day, practically in the last moment, before he left, he said to me, "Where are your skiing boots?"</sentence><sentence id="909">I said, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="910">And he said, "I want you to wear them today."</sentence><sentence id="911">I said, "Papa, skiing shoes in June?"</sentence><sentence id="912">He said, "I want you to wear them."</sentence><sentence id="913">One didn't argue with one's father.</sentence><sentence id="914">So I put on those boots

id="915">I didn't know, and I don't know how my father could have known that those boots were really instrumental in saving my life on that march.</sentence><sentence id="916">I had ski

then she became totally lucid, and one of the most shocking things was that one of my other friends had somehow found two potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="926">And she gave them to me, she said, "It's for you and for Ilsa."</sentence><sentence id="927">I gave Ilsa the potato and she said she wasn't hungry.</sentence><sentence id="928">That's the most incredible statement, not to be hungry.</sentence><sentence id="929">And she said to me, "You eat it."</sentence><sentence id="930">And then she said, she said, "I'm angry at no one.</sentence><sentence id="931">I hope nobody is

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1414">A: Now?</sentence><sentence id="1415">Looking back now over almost half a century, it is half a century, um, I think one is</sentence><sentence id="1417">struck by the nobility of the spirit which also lived in this darkness.</sentence><sentence id="1418">The act of kindness, the type of support, the selflessness and the love, which I think was the support system to be able to endure that.</sentence><sentence id="1419">A belief in something.</sentence><sentence id="1420">Not, uh the inhumanity of, of our um captors, but, but the humanity which existed in the victims.</sentence><sentence id="1421">And there was a great deal of that.</sentence><sentence id="1422">My friend Ilsa, who gave me that raspberry, she carried it in her pocket all day long on a hot incredible day, and derived joy of giving it tome.</sentence><sentence id="1423">Um, the one time when we uh stood roll call for, for a long time, and a piece of bread sailed over the barbed wire into our group and one of the girls caught it, and we all knew whence it came and who had it.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And we were all questioned, we were all beaten, no one gave the person away.</sentence><sentence id="1425">If someone which became much more difficult later when we were not with Mrs. Kigler any anymore, who had showed such humanity, but later on when really cruelty and bestiality was the reign, um, one helped the other.</sentence><sentence id="1426">You know, if somebody couldn't work or was sick, you know, we, we all tried to, to help the other person, to pull them through.</sentence><sentence id="1427">Um, and, and that was taken absolutely for granted.</sentence><sentence id="1428">Now I don't mean to say that that everyone there was, was angelic.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I mean uh, we were human, but by and large, and this is why, you know, when I wrote my first book, to me it was the most important thing to be able to put on that it is all based on truth, I used all names, all <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and I whatever I have written, I always use my maiden name as well as my married name.</sentence><sentence id="1430">I want anyone to challenge the truth of that statement.</sentence><sentence id="1431">Unfortunately so few stories you know survived.</sentence><sentence id="1432">Um, so little has been said about that, you know because the overwhelming thing there of course was uh, was so horrible, and, and when one tries to um, to explain the holocaust, it uh, it is a horror which um, which has the upper hand because such horror has, has never, uh, never been done to, to, to people with so, that somehow what seems to escape are the little acts of kindness, the everyday thing, which, which really spurred the spark of hope that one had to have in order just to go on.</sentence><sentence id="1433">And that was the, and I don't know of anyone who committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1434">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was surrounded by barbed wire, which was electrically charged.</sentence><sentence id="1435">Not one person that I know of ever went and touched it.</sentence><sentence id="1436">So we certainly had enough reason to, to do it quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1437">No one did.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Everyone wanted to live with, with every fiber of one's being, and I think that was a defiance.</sentence><sentence id="1439">They wanted us dead, but we are going to live for as long as we possibly can.</sentence><sentence id="1440">And we did, and this is why it is so sad, that when one sees pictures of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, one sees those big vacant eyes over the barbed wire, people who look more like animals than as human beings and no one seems to know what was going on uh in the minds and hearts of the people, that they were looking at something beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="1441">I remember one time, a, a bird flew into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and it perched itself on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and started to sing.</sentence><sentence id="1442">No, no one ever had a more appreciative audience than that bird did, and how, how we watched its flight then to freedom over, over the barbed wire and ov-ov-over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and one time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenberg</span>, uh, where we also stood for hours roll call.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Uh, one spring, in the corner of this <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, the among the debris of the cement, a flower poked its head, and you could see hundreds of feet shuffling around it, nobody stepped on the flower.</sentence><sentence id="1444">It was something</sentence><sentence id="1446">incredible to see uh that a flower heralded sort of a new spring of, of, of ----------of beauty.</sentence><sentence id="1447">Now, you know, one should not need uh stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to appreciation of, of beauty, but, but it was an incredible moment to see that, that many things that one sees for granted.</sentence><sentence id="1448">Um, there were beautiful things there.</sentence><sentence id="1449">Unfortunately, and that is always the biggest pain, that so few lived to know the joy of freedom, and that is the most painful thing.</sentence><sentence id="1450">And sometimes the difficulty to, to enjoy all the things, to know how many were deprived of it.</sentence><sentence id="1451">That's, that's the hardest thing.</sentence><sentence id="1452">But I think if one can somehow give the legacy of the nobility to the inheritance of this new spring and new generation of children and grandchildren, who have grown up in freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1453">If they can understand it and, and value it, then, they have achieved a sort of immortality.</sentence><sentence id="1454">I think this is really why they have to understand something, because it is difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1455">You know, millions, numbers have no meaning.</sentence><sentence id="1456">It's the identification is one that counts, and if, if someone somehow today, and people who live in freedom can take the identity of just one who was deprived of it at all, and live their lives vicariously, and enjoy the things for which, which they have so hungered, I think that uh, that we will build a better world.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And I have hopes for the world in spite of everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
