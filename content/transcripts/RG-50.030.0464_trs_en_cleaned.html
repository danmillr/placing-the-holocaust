<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Now was this -- was this kind of thing fairly typical of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, the kids were going to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, not a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: <span class="BUILDING">Public school</span>, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: That was typical maybe of the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Not of the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> so much.</sentence><sentence id="266">In the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> they may -- may have gone to some <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, but they would also go to the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span>, you know, to study, you know, the Talmud, and the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: -- the [indecipherable] kind of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: And that -- and that you didn't do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: No, no, not at all, no, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Were there Jewish youth groups in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span>, or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: There were some Jewish youth groups, I was very young, I didn't belong to any.</sentence><sentence id="277">My -- my brother did, you know, he was -- he belonged to organization called Betar, which was -- which I was kind of a -- unhappy about as I gre -- grow and understood because I was [indecipherable] to the right of center, you know, Jewish organization.</sentence><sentence id="278">But he was -- he belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Betar</span> and -- and was fairly active in that.</sentence><sentence id="279">That wasn't -- you know, they had some uniforms of their own, all that.</sentence><sentence id="282">But that was early -- in the early stages, later on became much more difficult, even before the war, because the -- there was a lot of -- obviously some anti-Semitism that -- it was prevalent.</sentence><sentence id="283">And incidentally, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span> also had a very, very high Ukrainian population.</sentence><sentence id="284">It was one third Jewish, one third Ukrainian, one th-third Polish.</sentence><sentence id="285">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span> being <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> was a cradle of -- of Ukrainian nationalism and was a -- a lot of animosity between the Poles, and the Ukrainian and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="286">So the Jews basically, a lot of the Jews had a -- had a kind of a double -- double whammy, they were obviously hated by the Ukrainians and of course, a lot of the Poles were also, you know, anti -- anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="287">So -- so that was a big problem for the L'vov Jewish population.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Did -- did you feel that as a child growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: I felt it occasionally, in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, when sometimes a teacher would make some funny Jewish, you know, imitating Jewish words, or -- or one of the kids would speak maybe a little bit of a what I would call a Jewish Polish, you know, he would kind of make some f-fun of that and all that, but generally I did not feel a direct -- direct thing.</sentence><sentence id="304">I was never, you know, accosted or attacked or anything like that or -- or by -- by -- by other kids because we were pretty -- ina pretty heavily Jewish population where I -- where I lived, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="308">And do you recall your brothers talking about that at all?</sentence><sentence id="309">Ha-having any experience?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Well -- well, there were restrictions in getting to a higher education.</sentence><sentence id="314">You know, there were quotas involved and all that, and so my brother went to -- to a -- a <span class="BUILDING">commerce high school</span>, you know, tried to get a degree there, and that didn't last very long, but my father -- my brother never mentioned any -- any overt or direct confrontations as such, because again, the Jewish community, even though it wasn't a modern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L'vov</span>, was still very, very closely knit, you know, and there was very little interaction, except for the -- some the servants that would work,</sentence><sentence id="316">0 or some workers that would come to work, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="317">So that was a -- a -- socially fairly isolated, I would say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Would you have called yourself upper middle class, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: I would say middle class, maybe not upper, but middle.</sentence><sentence id="328">Certainly comfortably middle, not upper.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: How -- how did you find out that your parents were going to get divorced?</sentence><sentence id="332">Did your mother come to you, your father come to you, or they just --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: Well, I knew -- I knew that there were difficulties, I knew there were problems, and I knew when my mother took me with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span>, I knew that I -- that things were wrong, things were bad.</sentence><sentence id="334">My mother never told me directly that she was -- that she was going to be divorced, so sh -- but I found out si -- very shortly after, especially when my father began to look for another -- for a new companion, you know, to -- to try to remarry.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Did you resent that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

right, and then from there they would transport you and load you on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and wherever they -- you know, they ship.</sentence><sentence id="1854">So as we were walking towards the <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span>, and I thought okay, here is the end of that, right?</sentence><sentence id="1855">At the <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span>, one of the guys, he said, "Run away, run away."</sentence><sentence id="1856">Because they kind of -- there was another guard, there was one of the people there, because I was the kid, I was the youngest,

didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> to learn a trade.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And the way it worked was that you actually lived on the <span class="REGION">premises</span>, you ate and slept on the <span class="REGION">premises</span>, and you worked on the <span class="REGION">premises</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2082">And I slept on a <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> with a couple of other kids about my age, and I was put to work.</sentence><sentence id="2083">Now, Polish which was perfect was a L'vov Polish.</sentence><sentence id="2084">And the L'vov Polish dialect was very much divided by the Warsaw people.</sentence><sentence id="2085">It was sort of analogous to let's say a Chicago English versus Brooklyn English, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2086">With <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> English being clipped, sort of you know, short and clipped, whereas as you know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> is the singsong and all those yishes, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2087">So they kind of identified almost the -- the L'vov Polish with Jews, with Jewish Poles.</sentence><sentence id="2088">And I caught this right away, they -- where they kind of started to kind of laugh at me, you know, they -- there's some jokes about that in Polish about the -- about the L'vov dialect.</sentence><sentence id="2089">And this was a dialect spoken not only by -- by, you know, lower classes, was just a -- a typical, you know,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2093">5 even -- even in the -- you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, a good New York English is not like a -- like a Midwestern English, even -- even the -- you know, among the intellectuals.</sentence><sentence id="2094">So I had to quickly learn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> dialect.</sentence><sentence id="2095">I was very conscious of that, I was very concerned because I knew I wou -- I was afraid that they may question that, that I may have -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And my biggest, biggest problem was again being circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="2097">That preyed on my mind virtually 24 hours a day, because when you live with young -- wa -- other boys, you know, and you associate with them, and you -- and you -- and you there, you know, boys tend to play games, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2098">They'd li -- sometimes they compare anatomies, you know, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2099">And I was very, very concerned about that because the minute that would happen, you know, I -- I often thought to myself, what would they do if they were to discover -- what would they -- what would they do.</sentence><sentence id="2100">And I didn't think that they would inform on me because they were very, very pate -- you know, Poles were very anti-German.</sentence><sentence id="2101">But they would definitely kick me out, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2102">I mean, they would not kick me, because I mean, they could be all killed for that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2103">Or maybe some of them -- maybe some of the, you know, workers would actually maybe even inform on me, because we lived in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were -- at first there were three apprentices, and there were four journeymen as they called them.</sentence><sentence id="2104">These are the foremen, the journeymen, th-the ones that the -- that they knew their trade and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2105">And was hard to tell among them, who -- who would be, you know, who would be the one that would actually -- would actually denounce me or -- to the - - to the authorities being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2106">So that was constantly on my mind, and I was very concerned about that.</sentence><sentence id="2107">And fortunately I -- I -- we never got into that.</sentence><sentence id="2108">You know, I ended up with -- with only one.</sentence><sentence id="2109">There were two more boys, and there was one -- one apprentice by the name of Janek.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2110">And he was kind of, you know, h-he -- he -- he was a little bit of a -- how shall I say?</sentence><sentence id="2111">Quiet and - - and not so outgoing.</sentence><sentence id="2112">So I -- we never had occasion to [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2113">We slept in the same --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2117">6 on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span>, and -- and we worked, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2118">And the -- the place of work -- what they manufactured there, or manufactured was rawhide harnesses for the utility workers on -- on poles, you know, they climbed the <span class="DLF">poles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2119">Rawhide harnesses.</sentence><sentence id="2120">Was very, very hard work, you know, to si -- you had to sew it by hand.</sentence><sentence id="2121">They were -- they used underarm holsters for the secret police.</sentence><sentence id="2122">That was one of the jobs too, that they had to -- to -- to work on.</sentence><sentence id="2123">All kinds of bags, and wallets and this kind of stuff, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2124">The owners lived on the sa -- everything was on one level, you know, the owners, their qua -- you know, their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, their <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span> and everything was on the same level.</sentence><sentence id="2125">And not too long after I started there, because of my age, 13 years old, I was going to be 14 in the fall, there was a law that you had to get a Kennkarte.</sentence><sentence id="2126">A Kennkarte means in German -- Kenn is to know, and karte was like a i -- .D. na -- LD.</sentence><sentence id="2127">card, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2128">And you had to go to the local authorities to pick it up, to the police, to the Gestapo, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2129">So what do you do now?</sentence><sentence id="2130">I had no choice, I had to go.</sentence><sentence id="2131">I couldn't say I wouldn't -- I'm not going to go.</sentence><sentence id="2132">I didn't know what they were doing there, whether they had suspi -- you know, whether they were screening people for the -- for the -- for the -- and I went.</sentence><sentence id="2133">I showed them my birth certificate, I told them I was working for the firm of Boleslaw Konarski.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Boom, I got a Kennkarte.</sentence><sentence id="2135">So here I was officially now an official Aryan.</sentence><sentence id="2136">No phony, no, no, you know [indecipherable] I was officially an Aryan, no more Jewish, you know, right?</sentence><sentence id="2137">Except for my anatomy I was no more Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2138">And living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> at that time, I encountered a number of things -- that was even before -- before the following year, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2139">In other words, when you're on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> -- after work, you know, | and this kid, we were just roaming around, you know, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2140">They had these -- the police was walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they would periodically stop people and ask for I.D.s and round-ups.</sentence><sentence id="2141">And what they were looking for basically is undocumented Poles.</sentence><sentence id="2142">They were looking also for resistance because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> already had a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2146">7 strong resistance movement at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2147">And of course they're looking for Jews, or people that were trying to escape, Jews who tried to -- to -- to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, who were -- were out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2148">And what they would do is -- oh, and incidentally, in addition to those placards which said harboring a Jew, you know, is -- i-it would be death penalty, they had placards showing how to identify a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2149">And they were showing -- presumably that was all developed by -- by this -- I think it was Rosenberg was the German guy who pr -- who apparently claimed that there are certain anatomical features in the Jewish face which are 100 percent Jewish, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2150">By virtue of the shape of the nose, by virtue of the shape of the ears.</sentence><sentence id="2151">By some bone structure, by the cranial structure, whatever it was, with very elaborate charts, you know, as to how to identify the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2152">And that was done in Polish, so that Poles who were inclined to do so, you know, would be -- or Ukrainians, whoever it was -- and there were a lot of Estonians and Latvians too at that time, cause they were the guards of the -- many of them were guards of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, would be able to identify a Jew and maybe report him to the -- to the Germans, who would be very grateful for it, I'm sure, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2153">So that was another thing.</sentence><sentence id="2154">So what they would do is as they were walking down the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and they were -- have these quick round-ups.</sentence><sentence id="2155">If the -- if somebody looks suspicious, you know, a -- a male, of course, they would take him around the corner and let him drop his pants, you know, to check to see whether he was circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="2156">Now circumcision was like a hundred percent giveaway in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which is very hard to understand here, because I mean we know that -- and I -- I-I know the trend today is maybe not to do it as much, but I know that virtually -- and especially the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I mean, mer -- many hun -- millions of men are circumcised, of whatever background, wha -- you know, right?</sentence><sentence id="2157">Whether it's Muslim or ca -- or Catholic, Protestant and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2158">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, this was not done.</sentence><sentence id="2159">In fact, I remember hearing a story that if someone who was not Jewish was circumcised, had to have some iron proof</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2163">8 documentation that for medical reasons, and whatever -- I don't know whether that person, you know, ever -- how he -- how they -- they managed to sur -- to -- to live, you know, to have -- to prove that -- that he was not Jewish, because that was -- they would -- there was no questions asked, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2164">I mean, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2165">Was kind of ironical.</sentence><sentence id="2166">In fact, in fact, I heard of cases where some Jewish men tried to go through surgery to create some kind of false foreskin, or enlarge the skin, which always failed, you know, in order to hide the fact they were circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="2167">You may have heard about that.</sentence><sentence id="2168">So that was another fact, and now come April 1943, the ghetto uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2169">And I was not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in terms of -- of being able to actually see the smoke and the shooting.</sentence><sentence id="2170">And sometimes I would see a column of me -- of people, of Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> being marched out for -- obviously to be taken somewhere to a transport, to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2171">And I believe that lasted for about three or four, three weeks or so, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was obviously destroyed, and -- and that wa -- that made a tremendous impact on me, I mean I was -- I kind of felt helpless.</sentence><sentence id="2172">I -- I felt -- that was when I really felt a sense of great guilt, that here I was, you know, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you know, and I was getting away with it, and here were these people [indecipherable] they were fighting for their lives and so forth, there was nothing I could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="2173">I mean, I certainly wasn't brave enough, or thinking that I would just tun into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and join them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2174">That would have tote -- it would have been -- you know, I mean I -- you had to try to survive, you know, and tha -- and that was my fortune that I was able to be on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, even though not knowing what the next day would bring for me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2175">So that was very bad, that was -- that was
