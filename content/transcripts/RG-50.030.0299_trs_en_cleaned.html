<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Aron, can you tell me your full name, and when and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name was Aron Dereczynski and now we change to Aron Derman D-E-R-M-A-N.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">That's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">White Russia</span>, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in <span class="REGION">White Russia</span>, not far from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in 1922, and since I spent there almost until, till the War.</sentence><sentence id="7">Now, my family was a middle class family.</sentence><sentence id="8">My parents had a <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">The business was a <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span>, and I had three sisters: An oldest sister of mine was the name Libby, Libby.</sentence><sentence id="10">Then I came, Aron, and after me was a younger sister, Fagel, and then a younger sister after by the name Edcia.</sentence><sentence id="11"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fagel</span> was born three years after me in 1924, and Edcia was born in 1932.</sentence><sentence id="12">Life was pretty normal for us.</sentence><sentence id="13">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was not a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">It was approximately about 12,000 and out of the 12,000 we had almost 10,000 Jews, so the majority were Jewish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="15">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was rich with all different kinds of Jewish institutions.</sentence><sentence id="16">We had quite a few, I could count eight or 10 different kind of <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, little <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, and it was a learning center for -- we had famous rabbis, famous yeshiva, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, for me, it was a very happy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a very happy <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live because the majority were Jews and Antisemitism was quite prominent in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">And, so we did not feel that much because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was the majority of Jews and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we lived was Jewish, so we had hardly any problems until in the later years when it came to the 30s when Hitler got into power and the Nazis started getting into power.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="18">Antisemitism spread much more in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and then we started feeling from Antisemitism even being the majority of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="19">We still start feeling Antisemitism in two different channels.</sentence><sentence id="20">For example, we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> near that to enlarge it so they brought in the -- brought in the Polish workers from the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> was known as a city of lots of Antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="21">So, approximately at that time, they brought in maybe about 500 to 700 Polish workers.</sentence><sentence id="22">And then on a weekend when they used to get drunk and come in and do quite a bit of damage, the Antisemitic -- all different kinds of Antisemitic acts.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="23">So, we used to feel partially already Antisemitism and then through other <span class="DLF">channels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> used to order some old men to preach on Sunday, all different kind of acts against the Jews, that they were taking over the business, because it was mostly -- the business was in Jewish hands and for many reasons, because the majority 90 percent were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="25">So, even in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you could find a lawyer, the doctor, the engineer, but at the same time the carpenter, the shoemaker, and any type of work.</sentence><sentence id="26">The professionals were Jews, and so were the hard working and the daily workers were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="27">So, actually it was no different because the Jews took over the bigger jobs, or the better jobs.</sentence><sentence id="28">But in the same time some of the priests were preaching in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and telling that the Jews are running the business, which was completely untrue, for the reason that I was saying.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="32">[Technical conversation]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: When the Antisemitism started increasing, this was roughly when?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: It was about 1935, 1936.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: Tell me about your involvement with the youth movements.</sentence><sentence id="37">Tell me when you first got involved in it and why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="41">I got involved in the youth movement, was approximately when approximately I was about 10 years old.</sentence><sentence id="42">I belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ha-Shomer</span> ha-Za'ir.</sentence><sentence id="43">It was an organization, a Zionist organization, and mostly in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, the youth belonged to different kind of Zionist organization, but it happened that the Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir was one of the larger ones, and it was a very -- a social outlet, and at the same time we learned a lot, at that time we learned a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, in hoping that some way in some time I will all be able to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">And this way was going on for quite a few years, from 1932, 1933, 1934, in the years to come, in the summers we used to go to different -- for vacations.</sentence><sentence id="45">We used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for about a month, or six week <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we used to have 50, 75 kids my age from different small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from different <span class="REGION">areas</span>, and that's where we spent almost every summer.</sentence><sentence id="47">In the same way as my two other sisters belonged to.</sentence><sentence id="48">They were not together in the same -- they were a different age, so they belonged to different groups.</sentence><sentence id="49">We had a reason partially for that because we thought we have no future.</sentence><sentence id="50">We, already, by that time we were thinking that we had no future to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">So, our dream was that some day that we were going to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, especially for me.</sentence><sentence id="52">In the later years, in 1937, I applied to go to <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">So, I applied to be accepted with <span class="BUILDING">Youth Aliyah</span>".</sentence><sentence id="54">And by that time it was impossible, almost impossible to get a special visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">The only way you could was a small <span class="DLF">window</span> of opportunity was it being a youngster with Youth Aliyah and going to <span class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">So, some of my friends already went there.</sentence><sentence id="57">So, I had some friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and I was waiting the time will come, and I will get my visa, and I will move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">And then the war broke out, and I never was able to get the visa and emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: In the time before the war broke out, what did your parents think about everything that was going on; do you remember their talking about the Antisemitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Yes. [</sentence><sentence id="81">remember talking about it because we did not have any <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> which were not Jewish, and all of a sudden, they -- some way, they got organized and they opened up <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, supported, I don't know by whom.</sentence><sentence id="82">It was partially maybe by the government.</sentence><sentence id="83">I don't know from whom.</sentence><sentence id="84">I was too young to understand probably, or to know.</sentence><sentence id="85">And they opened up <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> with special competition to our <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, not only to <span class="BUILDING">clothing stores</span>, but in all different kinds of business.</sentence><sentence id="86">If it would be a <span class="BUILDING">food store</span> or anything else and to cut down the prices and even already some <span class="NPIP">places</span> " A Zionist program which sought to evacuate Jewish children and young people from Europe and provide them care and education in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">they stood, or they hired special young people to stay by the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, and most of our customers were farmers or coming in from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, and they used to stand in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> by telling them, "Don't go in, that's a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span>."</sentence><sentence id="90">And don't let him go in.</sentence><sentence id="91">They stood in front of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and didn't let customer or farmers walk in.</sentence><sentence id="92">We couldn't do much hardly about it, because you couldn't go to the police.</sentence><sentence id="93">The police wouldn't help you or do you, because we hardly had, even with a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like this, I don't remember, maybe we had one.</sentence><sentence id="94">We didn't even have a Jewish policeman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">So, everything, I mean like the government, the city jobs were held by Gentiles, but not Jews.</sentence><sentence id="96">And so life was getting little by little it was getting rougher.</sentence><sentence id="97">And the question is "Why didn't they move out, why didn't they go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, why didn't they go to a different part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="98">It wasn't so easy when your parents, or my parents, we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but maybe the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was 100 years.</sentence><sentence id="99">My father lived there, my grandfather lived there, who knows who before, and we lived in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and for us it was settled.</sentence><sentence id="100">Plus the family, all the family that we had, and we had quite a large family, we had I believe over 80 people, members in the family.</sentence><sentence id="101">They all lived in the same <span class="REGION">area</span>, not too far.</sentence><sentence id="102">So life was almost a comfortable life.</sentence><sentence id="103">It wasn't a rich life.</sentence><sentence id="104">It wasn't luxury, but for us, we felt that we had all the luxury that we wanted, so life was almost, we could say, special like normal, until the last years when they started Antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="105">So, that too, we had in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and protection.</sentence><sentence id="106">We had the strong men.</sentence><sentence id="107">Who were the strong men?</sentence><sentence id="108">Slonim had all the -- how would you call them, the "draggers"."</sentence><sentence id="109">It means the people who would load from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> -- from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, load the merchandise, put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, at that time it was more horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, to deliver to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">It was the strong guys.</sentence><sentence id="111">And in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> two strong guys, quite a few other ones, but two of them were the main two strong guys.</sentence><sentence id="112">In fact, I remember the name of them.</sentence><sentence id="113">One of them was Haskel and one of them was Note.</sentence><sentence id="114">So, by that time, arms was not available.</sentence><sentence id="115">Nobody used arms, but he could find out if somebody, Polish kids, or Polish young men come and did something, hid or did some damage to some of the Jewish people, he could come up to him and break his arm or break his leg.</sentence><sentence id="116">And that was the punishment, and they were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="117">So, we had that.</sentence><sentence id="118">That was in our favor.</sentence><sentence id="119">We had this strong man were with us.</sentence><sentence id="120">So, usually it was like a good protection.</sentence><sentence id="121">And that's the way it was going on almost until the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Tell me about the war breaking out and those first few weeks after.</sentence><sentence id="166">Tell me what you remember of the moments and what you heard?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: We had two accidents of war, as far as I'm remembering.</sentence><sentence id="170">The first one was when the pact was made up between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- Ribbentrop and Molotov -- when they decided they were going to split up <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and they split up our part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, at that time when it happened, that transfer was the expectation was very -- was almost, I mean, we didn't know it was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="172">We didn't know what the deal was.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, we thought, we didn't know who was going to occupy our part of the <span class="REGION">land</span> Slonim, until we realized that all of sudden the Russians are the ones to occupy our Slonim.</sentence><sentence id="174">It was a tremendous, ?</sentence><sentence id="175">Literal translation from the Yiddish "schleppers," a term used for manual laborers.3 On September 29, 1939, foreign ministers Joachim von Ribbentrop of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Vyacheslav Molotov of the Soviet Union modified the earlier German-Soviet Nonagression Pact with an agreement that partitioned the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">tremendous excitement, and we were very happy, because we didn't know what the Russians were going to do us, but we knew that between the two evils, we called them at that time, the Russians were much better.</sentence><sentence id="179">Because the Germans, we knew, if they are going to come, they are going to be much worse.</sentence><sentence id="180">We did not know about any killings.</sentence><sentence id="181">We did not know about anything they were going to do, but so, but we heard -- in the 30s Hitler was already in power -- what he did to some refugees that came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when they were thrown out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, and they told us what's happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">And here, the Russians came, SO We were very, very happy.</sentence><sentence id="183">And me being a kid, I jumped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> moved in, and they were very friendly, so we jumped -- kids -- on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">We were very, very happy, but only thing a little accident happened.</sentence><sentence id="185">I was wearing a nice watch, that I had got for my bar mitzvah, and here I am on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, and the Russian officer comes in, and he says, "I like your watch.</sentence><sentence id="186">How much do you want?"</sentence><sentence id="187">I remember I paid like something a small amount of money 10 dollars, 10 zlotys whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="188">He gives me 20, 25 zlotys, so I figure, "Oh-ho!</sentence><sentence id="189">It's a big deal.</sentence><sentence id="190">I'm going to give him the watch, and I'm going to go out to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy another one."</sentence><sentence id="191">Sure enough, I couldn't get another watch anymore.</sentence><sentence id="192">So, but this was indeed to every <span class="NPIP">place</span> they came in like hungry.</sentence><sentence id="193">I mean, they were hungry for merchandise, for things.</sentence><sentence id="194">So, they were grabbing and running in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, and taking away, buying out -- they didn't take away -- buy out-- but they give us piece of paper, rubles, but we didn't realize that we wouldn't be able to replace like in our <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">They come in and they bought out the whole <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">The whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelves</span> in couple days, one day almost.</sentence><sentence id="197">But my little experience with the watch, and then I found out it had happened with everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="198">They were buying out, but mainly we were terrible happy.</sentence><sentence id="199">The material things didn't bother us, because the question was of life and death and what war was going to bring in.</sentence><sentence id="200">So this material things was just past and didn't mean anything.</sentence><sentence id="201">We were very happy by being occupied that time by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">Then, I had another experience.</sentence><sentence id="203">Years -- I'm coming back to the same -- belonging to the Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="204">So our togetherness, or our organization, still didn't disband, but we went secretly.</sentence><sentence id="205">So, we were part in this Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="206">And here I got an order, two of us, for me and another friend of mine, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, which is approximately, I don't know, maybe 200 kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="207">So, we went for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and they said in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> we have the Zionist organization is active and we should take a ride over there and see what kind of connections we can make and maybe I can find the connections to move to -- go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">So, I left my family and I went with my friend and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">And it turns out, I find out later, that being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, staying over there, they gave us, we were all in a couple large <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, a couple long <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span>, and we didn't know yet, if you could go to -- some way to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> was -- that time was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litwa</span>*.</sentence><sentence id="211">It wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it was part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litwa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">And the Russians didn't fully occupy it.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, there was a lot of freedom there.</sentence><sentence id="214">What we didn't have here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">And being over there I met some other young people that belonged to Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir.</sentence><sentence id="216">That's the only way the secret could go on was is knowing with the same organization.</sentence><sentence id="217">That's illegal, so you were afraid to be -- I mean to reveal to other people to other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">So, I was there and I got in touch with the leadership from the Ha- Shomer ha-Za'ir, and to my disappointment, they send me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">They said, "We need leaders in the organization not to leave now, but we need them still in the <span class="REGION">occupied territory</span>, 4 <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> (Polish)</sentence><sentence id="221">back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>."</sentence><sentence id="222">So, fortunately for me, at that time, I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">I was arrested by the way by the Russians on the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and they took me as a spy, but I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, I was back with my family until the real war broke out between -- under the Russian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="226">I wanted to follow my education, so I went to a <span class="BUILDING">technical school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Russian technical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And, what I learned there is to be mainly partly of engineering in movie projectors.</sentence><sentence id="228">The whole movie contents of the system, how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">projector</span> works, how the film works.</sentence><sentence id="229">By that time it was a novelty.</sentence><sentence id="230">The course took us almost a year, and then after a year to pay him off, everything was free in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">So, they sent me away in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to show movies on <span class="DLF">farms</span> in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">That's the same thing, it was maybe 70, 80 kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">In there I got ajob.</sentence><sentence id="234">I used to go out and show movies in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">Collect a few <span class="DLF">farms</span> or small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and show the movies in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, show Russian movies.</sentence><sentence id="236">And that was Russian propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="237">And being over there, one night on a Saturday night, I was out on a date, late in the evening, I could hear the bombardments and the war started, the Russian-German war.</sentence><sentence id="238">And here it caught me away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, nobody around, a young fellow, and I had to make up a decision, should -- it was immediately panic with the Russians coming in-- should I run with the Russians, away from the front, because the front wasn't that far away, or should I go back to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>?</sentence><sentence id="239">And I decided I'm was going, going on -- to go on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and then I'll go away, run away in Russia.[Technical conversation] Going on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, already I could feel the war.</sentence><sentence id="240">What did I see on the <span class="DLF">road</span>?</sentence><sentence id="241">What did I see on the way?</sentence><sentence id="242">The Germans were shooting other people and the refugees running away.</sentence><sentence id="243">It was soldiers, it was plain people.</sentence><sentence id="244">It was people like me, and we were trying to stay a little bit off the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and here the Germans used to came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and dive down and shoot at us.02: 37:10 Shoot people, innocent people running and just shooting at them.</sentence><sentence id="245">The same thing like it would be animals or cows.</sentence><sentence id="246">They were shooting on cows and people in the same way.</sentence><sentence id="247">Until the middle of the day, so all of sudden I saw a dog fight and I was real--_ because we didn't see any more Russians.</sentence><sentence id="248">The Russians

line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">And we met pilots who didn't have a chance to even to get in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">The Germans bombed the <span class="DLF">airports</span>, the <span class="DLF">air</span> runs.</sentence><sentence id="258">And they were all running back to Russian -- closer to the <span class="DLF">Russian

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> and the German parachuted right in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were there.</sentence><sentence id="262">So, I took part right with the Germans, being part of the groups that were running away.</sentence><sentence id="263">So some of the Russians, they had the arms, so they went right to the pilot where he parachuted in and they didn't wait too long.</sentence><sentence id="264">They killed him right on <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but they didn't take away his arm.</sentence><sentence id="265">After they left, I was there and I took away his gun.</sentence><sentence id="266">So, that's the first time I already had a</sentence><sentence id="268">gun by myself, and I thought, "Maybe, I don't know I will have to use it or not."</sentence><sentence id="269">And that's the way it was burning, the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around were all on fire, all burning, and that took me about one night, and at -- probably we got a little bit of transportation on the way, too.</sentence><sentence id="270">And the next day, I came to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, and that was on a Friday.</sentence><sentence id="271">I'd say it took us quite a few days between leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we almost -- for a while I thought it's only a few days -that's quite a few days before we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">Friday morning, I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">I don't have to tell you, I mean the joy was real great that here their only son -- they had three girls, I was the only one son.</sentence><sentence id="274">In Europe being one boy between four, between three sisters, so it was a big -- a son was different than the woman.</sentence><sentence id="275">I would be the one to <span class="BUILDING">Kaddish5</span>, I would be the one to carry the torch, to be the head of the family was the Kaddish after my father.</sentence><sentence id="276">So, I finally arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sitting over there and Friday evening before they make Shabbat, the shutters were closed.</sentence><sentence id="277">I can remember just like it's yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="278">And we are sitting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> reminiscing the stories, telling them again how much I went through the <span class="DLF">road</span> coming into my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, and it was later around nine, 10 o'clock we were ready to go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="279">It didn't take too long before I had the chance to fall asleep, we hear like crackles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">The first thing we hear is shooting, shooting in our <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">I lived in a small <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and there's shooting going on, and one after the other is getting stronger.</sentence><sentence id="282">The shots are getting more often, and here I hear crackles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">So, I was thinking, "Thank God it's raining."</sentence><sentence id="284">But it wasn't raining, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on fire.</sentence><sentence id="285">It was a wooden <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> caught on fire.</sentence><sentence id="286">So, we were forced to get out.</sentence><sentence id="287">Now that's about one or two o'clock in the midnight, and the only thing you could see was from the moonlight, you could see everything what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="288">So, some way we ducked out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we are in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and here in the middle of the fight is going in between the Germans and the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="289">What happened is, a group of Russians -- they were left over, the front was already far, far away but they didn't know -- the Russians didn't know that there was no more front in here and someway a fight was going on.</sentence><sentence id="290">So, we are coming out in the middle of the night, and we are immediately arrested by the Germans, and they put us in one <span class="NPIP">place</span>, maybe approximately about 15 or 18 men and women.</sentence><sentence id="291">The women they pushed aside while the men they took and they made everybody, if anybody had a cap on, they made everybody to take off their caps.</sentence><sentence id="292">And anybody who did not have hair, they put them in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="293">They shoot them in our <span class="DLF">back yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">So here I'm a young fellow, I lost my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and now I am witnessing a terrible massacre of eight or 10 men.</sentence><sentence id="295">My luck they didn't take me because I had hair.</sentence><sentence id="296">I wasn't in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="297">The reason why they looked at our hair is that they thought that maybe it's Russians, changed their clothes.</sentence><sentence id="298">So, they took the people -- and my father didn't have much hair, but he probably looked older, so by chance they didn't take him either.</sentence><sentence id="299">But I know the reason why they didn't take me.</sentence><sentence id="300">So, they killed them, and we had to dig a big <span class="DLF">graveyard</span>, a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in our <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and we buried the people there.</sentence><sentence id="301">Eight or 10 Jews, 12 Jews, they killed them and here left over a young man with no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- coming back, no food, no <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and by luck by the same thing, we had another <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">&gt; <span class="BUILDING">Holy One</span> (Aramaic); Jewish prayer said to honor the dead, especially close family

she'll need a dowry.</sentence><sentence id="307">So, they bought the <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">So, we went from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span>, we rented it before.</sentence><sentence id="309">And some day they will give it to my sisters.</sentence><sentence id="310">So, we went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived, at that time it was quite a few families lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, because the Russians in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> -- originally, we had something like about 10,000 Jews before the war.</sentence><sentence id="311">But when the Russians occupied, lots of refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were not allowed to live in different parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, so they pushed them to our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence

from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">So, it means the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> already housed many more people in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">So, they made -- they gave us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and after a while this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was split up too.</sentence><sentence id="315">So, they give us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">The family -- there was not enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, to sleep in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and a new life was started out for us to live under the German

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="784">Q: You knew that from the outset.</sentence><sentence id="785">You knew that there would be a reprisal because they said there would be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="788">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="789">Yes, by that time this in a little bit longer, they brought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, they brought in two or three farmers and they were hanging in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> with saying that, "This will happen to anybody who goes to the partisans or goes to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> or goes to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>."</sentence><sentence id="790">Now, that way you could see by the clothes that they were wearing, it was innocent farmers.</sentence><sentence id="791">You could see they weren't even partisans.</sentence><sentence id="792">But the main thing is the message that they were passing is, "That's what will happen if anyone is caught going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>."</sentence><sentence id="793">And in 8 snatchers (Yiddish) deg action (German); term used for operations whose objective was the physical removal and destruction of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="796">1 return is they did many times, is by catching one they will take out a-- punish other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="797">Now, the next thing that happens -- how does a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> operate?</sentence><sentence id="798">How does a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> work?</sentence><sentence id="799">How do you live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="800">You're not working, you're not earning any money.</sentence><sentence id="801">How does that work.</sentence><sentence id="802">Well, we were pushed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and here were 20,000 people, Jews, in one small little <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">We have no food, and we cannot earn any money to buy food.</sentence><sentence id="804">So, it was formed a Judenrat!(r).</sentence><sentence id="805">Who is the Judenrat?</sentence><sentence id="806">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the Judenrat, they took a committee, what they were before elders in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">Their job before the war was like federation, we have it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">They used to collect money to help the poor in different kinds of special and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish city</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span>, there's even lawsuits were going on, were settled not in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> but settled between the committees.</sentence><sentence id="809">So, they were the first ones when the German occupied.</sentence><sentence id="810">They asked to form a Jewish Judenrat, and that's the committee.</sentence><sentence id="811">So it was the easiest thing to take these people to take over the management of the government of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="812">So, the first time we had approximately six or eight people that belonged to the Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="813">Now, what was their function?Their function was -- the first thing is to register the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="814">How many Jews are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="815">It had a double purpose.</sentence><sentence id="816">Number one, the Germans wanted to know how many Jews we have there.</sentence><sentence id="817">And the next thing is they used to give rations.</sentence><sentence id="818">So, they gave us -- you went to register, because if you wouldn't go to register, you had no way how to get a ration.</sentence><sentence id="819">So, this was a double purpose for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="820">They knew exactly how many Jews are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because everybody wants to get food, and the rations were very small.</sentence><sentence id="821">Something like 200, 250 gram of bread and maybe something else once in a while.</sentence><sentence id="822">And that was the purpose of the Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="823">And then at the same time, is the Judenrat formed for Arbeitsamt!!.</sentence><sentence id="824">Arbeitsamt means -- is when the Germans came in and by that time it was even the Wehrmacht", the occupied.</sentence><sentence id="825">We had two different kinds of Germans.</sentence><sentence id="826">One was the Nazis and one was the Army.</sentence><sentence id="827">So, the army was just passing by, but in this same time already they learned how to rob, too.</sentence><sentence id="828">It didn't take long.</sentence><sentence id="829">So, they got orders to the Judenrat for slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="830">How do you get the best way slave labor, is you go into the Judenrat and you ask for 500 men.</sentence><sentence id="831">How do you get the 500 men?</sentence><sentence id="832">So the Judenrat formed a police, the Jewish police.</sentence><sentence id="833">The Jewish police got the order to go and get the slave laborers, so that was one part what was what the Jewish police did.</sentence><sentence id="834">And the other, the next day the Germans came in and they asked for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> to fix their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="835">The Jewish police went with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and pulled out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="836">The next minute they came in and they want 10 kilo of gold.</sentence><sentence id="837">They want 10 kilo of gold-- how do you get 10 kilo of gold?</sentence><sentence id="838">It's not what a Jew had gold in their pocket and in the <span class="DLF">vault</span>, and he gives them the gold.</sentence><sentence id="839">He had to collect the gold.</sentence><sentence id="840">How do you collect the gold.</sentence><sentence id="841">You get the golden watches that they had from hundreds or thousands of years whom one passed to each other.</sentence><sentence id="842">They had rings.</sentence><sentence id="843">They had bracelets, even golden teeth.</sentence><sentence id="844">In Europe, they had a lot of golden teeth.</sentence><sentence id="845">The dentist used to pull out some teeth or some people died and they hold -- holding teeth from them -- or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="846">All and all they accumulate, they had to accumulate 10 kilo of gold.</sentence><sentence id="847">That's a lot of gold.</sentence><sentence id="848">The next week somebody else came and they asked for another amount.</sentence><sentence id="849">I don't know if it was 10 or five.</sentence><sentence id="850">The next time they come in they want to have another 10 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis to oversee <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>."!</sentence><sentence id="851"><span class="BUILDING">employment office</span> (German) Armed forces (German)</sentence><sentence id="853">2 amount of gold.</sentence><sentence id="854">So, they collect it again.</sentence><sentence id="855">By that time it was much harder to collect, so the police had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and beg and ask and plead with the richer ones to save our lives -- and we thought so too.</sentence><sentence id="856">But maybe the passing time you'll buy off yourself with the order of the gold.</sentence><sentence id="857">And the third time, was no more people, was no more gold to give them so they took them out and killed the Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="858">And what did they say?</sentence><sentence id="859">That the Judenrat collected the gold and they kept it for themselves, and that's the reason they killed him.</sentence><sentence id="860">That was no reason for that.</sentence><sentence id="861">They killed them because it wasn't any more gold to give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="862">So, life -- that too, put a panic in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="863">They have to select another Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="864">It was harder to get another Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="865">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span> had a history, they had three Judenrats, and they were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="866">By the end they had only a Judenrat of only one man.</sentence><sentence id="867">That was by the end.</sentence><sentence id="868">So, life was getting, every day, tighter and tighter, and coming back to the Aktion of the 1,500 men, till was quiet in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="869">We called it quiet in comparison to the other times.</sentence><sentence id="870">So we called it normal, quiet, tranquil.</sentence><sentence id="871">But it wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="872">It was going on every single day.</sentence><sentence id="873">By that time, I went out on slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="874">I got a job working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> they called it the Beutelager"*.</sentence><sentence id="875">It was the place where they collected arms, the Russian arms and put them in one or two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="876">So, I found a job at this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I had inclination that I was a mechanic and being a mechanic, they let me work in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">Over there, in the Beutelager, I worked for a few months, and the head -- a foreman of our group who was named Choraszansky the, the father of one of my friends, the one nucleus that was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">So, we tried to smuggle in arms to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">How do you smuggle in arms to the ghetto?Every time you came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you were searched, and if you are caught with a piece of bread -- not only a piece of arm-- you were killed.</sentence><sentence id="880">So, we found a way.</sentence><sentence id="881">The foreman, the one I worked with, was very, very friendly with the two Germans around the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="882">And it was two German officers.</sentence><sentence id="883">Now, they were not Nazis, they were part of the Wehrmacht and one's name was Mutz and one was Brown.</sentence><sentence id="884">So, he got very friendly with them.</sentence><sentence id="885">What was the friendship?He could bring out -- the foreman -- was bringing out different kinds of clothes and valuables whatever they wanted from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they exchanged with him for articles like soap.</sentence><sentence id="886">And they had a lot of soap.</sentence><sentence id="887">I don't know for what reason, but they had lots in their <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, they had a lot of soap too.</sentence><sentence id="888">Because they had this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, other <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> with food, too, some of it.</sentence><sentence id="889">So, bartering with them, he made a deal with them that whatever he pays him sometime, he'll help him to bring <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because what good is it if he gets it outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">How does he bring it <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="891">So, what he did is, he gave him a boxes of soap.</sentence><sentence id="892">It's a wooden boxes and soap was large pieces like this not like we have it here, and we got an idea is to take out the soap under it and put hand grenades and put part of guns underneath and Mutz and Brown would take it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us, and delivering us the ammunition for us inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">And we did it quite a few times until we had well in comparison to any fighting force it was not enough arms.</sentence><sentence id="894">But meanwhile, we brought in, we start bringing in arms, and we had already, cache of arms.3 <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> of confiscated goods and valuables (German)</sentence><sentence id="896">3 So, this way, our organization got bigger, then we got in a radio which we

interested in our bringing the underground organization, but at the same time I'm unfortunate, I already lost already some of our friends, some of my friends were taken out.</sentence><sentence id="1166">But we were still left over, a nice group.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So, we started meeting more often, and planning and see how we can bring in arms to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1168">So, I found a job in, I found a job in slave labor outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they collected arms, Russian arms, which were left over when they were running away.</sentence><sentence id="1169">So, the Germans were collecting it in three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and they called it a Beutelager.</sentence><sentence id="1170">For me being, knowing a little bit mechanical work, so I got the job to be able to work in this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1171">And some of my friends, the ones from the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and the foreman was the father of my friend Choraszansky.</sentence><sentence id="1174">6 He was in charge of that section, and he working for there quite a while, he established a good relationship with the two Germans, the ones who were in charge of it.</sentence><sentence id="1175">They were German officers.</sentence><sentence id="1176">One was his name was Brown, and Mutz, Mutz and Brown.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And what was the bartering, what was the business that we could handle, we could do with them is, he used to take out some clothing or some valuables, it could be watches or something else, and in return he used to get from Mutz or Brown, he used to trade him for soap.</sentence><sentence id="1178">Now, this soap used to come in wooden boxes, small wooden boxes stacked up with soap.</sentence><sentence id="1179">So, what we did is we took out the layers, right on the bottom layers, we put in some hand grenades, all different parts of arms, on top we put back the soap, nailed back the box.</sentence><sentence id="1180">Now, how do you take them <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the box of soap?</sentence><sentence id="1181">So what we, what Mutz, mainly Mutz was doing it, so Mutz with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> used to deliver back to slaves, us the Jews, back to slaves to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1182">In fact with this he used to drive inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because everybody knew him.</sentence><sentence id="1183">He was there every single day picking up the laborers back and forth, and they knew him, so it was nothing a German coming in with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1184">They didn't check his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1185">They didn't look in anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1186">So, this way we could come in together with him and they didn't check us.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And this way we had a good chance to bring in -- actually, what the Germans did the job for us.</sentence><sentence id="1188">They brought in the arms for us there inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And it didn't take too long.</sentence><sentence id="1190">We had a few rifles, we had handguns, because a rifle takes a little more, it was a cut off rifle, we put it in the sack of flour.</sentence><sentence id="1191">We did it not only with soap, but we had flour when they brought in.</sentence><sentence id="1192">And we even had a radio.</sentence><sentence id="1193">The radio, what kind of radio is we took out from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, a broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1194">We took out the radio and put it someway together and we could get news.</sentence><sentence id="1195">Now, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had no communication with the outside world, or even with no <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1196">We had no newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="1197">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>, and before you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they took away from you everything.</sentence><sentence id="1198">You were not allowed to have no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> to start with.</sentence><sentence id="1199">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephones</span>, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1200">So, actually we are ina <span class="DLF">vacuum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1201">We didn't know anything of what's happening any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the world, any <span class="NPIP">place</span> even our neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">If Aktions of killings were happening in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, we had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="1203">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1204">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1205">It was just like a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1206">It was a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1207">We had no idea what's happening from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="1208">Not talking from farther away like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, but even in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> next to us, we had no idea what's happening unless, unless once in a while somebody ran away from the massacre and they came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they tell, is the only news you could find out.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And that's the way our organization was developing, but we had less members.</sentence><sentence id="1210">How many members we had, we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1211">Our immediate membership was, well we usually probably had 10 or 12 and then we lost a few, so we had about nine, 10 members put together.</sentence><sentence id="1212">And right after the massacre, life turned back to normal.</sentence><sentence id="1213">We call it normal.</sentence><sentence id="1214">Now, we have a different way of what normal life means, but being the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we call that for us, it's quiet and I lost that job.</sentence><sentence id="1215">They didn't let any more people, and I remember the night him and I worked in the Beutelager.</sentence><sentence id="1216">I remember the night of Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="1217">It happened.</sentence><sentence id="1218">We heard it by the Germans that the war started in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and so the hopes kind of helped us that maybe some help would come from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And at the same time we were talking between each other, maybe the world will find out, help will come, but it never came.</sentence><sentence id="1220">How could <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, how could they let to take people, take people and just kill them out, or destroy a people, but help never came.</sentence><sentence id="1221">So,</sentence><sentence id="1223">7 the underground was going on, but I had to still make a living to support -- I am now the head provide of my <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1224">So, I found another job.</sentence><sentence id="1225">My job was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verpflegungsamt</span>!".</sentence><sentence id="1226">It means a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they're giving out food to-- we'd call it to older Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1227">It could be Wehrmacht it could be Nazis, it could be rations to anybody who was German.</sentence><sentence id="1228">So, one day they came and they picked 300 people from the <span class="DLF">street</span> to unload a big transport of food, because that's when they opened up at that time, this particular <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1229">So, they picked up 300 men, because they needed it real fast unloaded.</sentence><sentence id="1230">And the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> was almost a block long right on the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1231">And I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1232">So unloading it, I could see its a good job.</sentence><sentence id="1233">It's nice, it was food, it was only with food, all different kinds of food, even big like a tire of swiss cheese and wines and everything were there.</sentence><sentence id="1234">So, something was going on they were talking that they might pick some of the people to have a steady job.</sentence><sentence id="1235">So, I tried to be young and strong and not hungry completely yet, so I worked like a slave that particular two days, and I was probably one of the best workers, and they picked me by the end.</sentence><sentence id="1236">I was one of eight people where they picked on this particular job.</sentence><sentence id="1237">And after the third day, I had a steady job.</sentence><sentence id="1238">It was a very good job.</sentence><sentence id="1239">I could support my family.</sentence><sentence id="1240">I could bring food.</sentence><sentence id="1241">They gave me food.</sentence><sentence id="1242">It was a well paid job.</sentence><sentence id="1243">I worked there in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> until I got an order to go out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1244">It didn't take long, in a short while I got an order to go to come to a special <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1245">In this same time, I remember probably it's in this same time when it happened is -- aone of the men when they took out the first time the 1,200 men and killed them, was a friend of mine, and he lived about a couple <span class="DLF">doors</span> away from us.</sentence><sentence id="1246">So, I went to visit his -- no, no they took out his father, mistake not -- he was still there.</sentence><sentence id="1247">His father was taken out on this particular day.</sentence><sentence id="1248">So, I came to visit my friend, and next <span class="DLF">door</span> I saw a nice beautiful girl, so I asked him, "Who is the girl?"</sentence><sentence id="1249">And he said, "She lives right here next door to me, if you want it I'll introduce you to her."</sentence><sentence id="1250">That was the same girl, the one I still know up until now.</sentence><sentence id="1251">It was Lisa Nussbaum that was her name, and I got acquainted with her and saw her and start coming in every single day.</sentence><sentence id="1252">The only thing I had a little bit problem because she was very young.</sentence><sentence id="1253">She was not quite 15, and her father didn't like it so much.</sentence><sentence id="1254">By that time, Lisa was -- her mother was killed in that big Aktion, so her father didn't like it that I was such an often visitor coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but I had a very good job, and I had food with me, and I had cigarettes with me and I had dry food what I used to bring from the Verpflegungsamt.</sentence><sentence id="1255">It gave me a chance to bribe him off, with the food, with the cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1256">And so, every time I used to come in, I used to bring in my pockets some dry foods, a package of cigarettes, before, it didn't take too long, I was a nice, friendly visitor.</sentence><sentence id="1257">This way I was coming in more often, and I got to know Lisa, and she was a very beautiful girl.</sentence><sentence id="1258">She had longer hair with -- curly hair with a longer face and I almost fell love in with her, but not quite yet because right from the beginning here I am getting an order that I have to go to the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I have to go.</sentence><sentence id="1260">That was my dream all " <span class="BUILDING">Food distribution bureau</span> (German)</sentence><sentence id="1262">8 the time to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1263">But it was just the beginning when I started knowing Lisa.</sentence><sentence id="1264">So, it wasn't such a big -- I mean objection for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1383">Q: How did the order come to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1385">A: The order came to me in very simple words.</sentence><sentence id="1386">Somebody came and told me "Aron, tomorrow at six-thirty, seven o'clock you come to this particular <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1387">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but almost by the end next to the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1388">So it came the order that, "tomorrow six-thirty, seven o'clock you're supposed to be there."</sentence><sentence id="1389">No questions asked.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1390">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I took my little knapsack and I put it in something over there, I don't know next to a shirt, pants, if I had anything, and I go to my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was supposed to meet.</sentence><sentence id="1392">My mother and my sisters notice that I'm going away.</sentence><sentence id="1393">I'm packing up and I'm going someplace.</sentence><sentence id="1394">They weren't so excited with that.</sentence><sentence id="1395">Here I am the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1396">They need me so badly in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, bringing in food, helping them with the rations, and the only man in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1397">I'm leaving.</sentence><sentence id="1398">So, my mother followed me and she came to the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1399">And being over there I am meeting some of my friends and some other new people that I didn't know, other people, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens up and my mother comes in and she falls on her knees and she starts crying and she starts begging, "How could you do it and leave us by ourselves?</sentence><sentence id="1400">You're going away."</sentence><sentence id="1401">Now, that was not typical of the other people.</sentence><sentence id="1402">Other families were just the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="1403">The mothers would take the kids and throw them out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, "Go ahead, maybe you'll survive."</sentence><sentence id="1404">My incident was different.</sentence><sentence id="1405">It took me a long, long time back until now, how much, if I did the right thing or not, and many times I could never forgive when I didn't take this opportunity to go to the underground because some of my -- anyway I turned back and I went back with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1406">I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1407">Until the other things happened, but I could never forgive myself, my mother, I don't know, I could never come to terms with that.</sentence><sentence id="1408">Did I do the right thing?</sentence><sentence id="1409">I didn't, for saving my life I didn't do the right thing.</sentence><sentence id="1410">The way my life turned out, it was all right, but that was one of my worst -- anytime when I talk about that, it's a very, very hard decision to come up and decide.</sentence><sentence id="1411">But being the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> -- so being the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> worked very, very hard on me.</sentence><sentence id="1412">Maybe if she wouldn't have mentioned that word, maybe it would be different, but saying that the father was taken away and you're the only one, so I turned back and I went back. --</sentence><sentence id="1413"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1414">I never had another opportunity, never had a chance to go.</sentence><sentence id="1415">Some of my friends, they did go.</sentence><sentence id="1416">They run away, they survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="1417">Some of them were killed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, but here I had a chance, yet I went too much, much more after that, but here I had the chance to be in a fighting unit and go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and I didn't take it.</sentence><sentence id="1418">It took me many, many years to rationalize if I did the right thing or not.</sentence><sentence id="1419">I went back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1420">My relationship with Lisa -- well in this way Lisa helped me a lot, because by that time I developed a relationship with a girlfriend and I lost some friends, but I gained, in that time, I gained with Lisa, and our relationship developed much closer and the visits were often, and that was going on until the terrible day of June 29, 1942.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1424">9 That's a new chapter where it starts there.</sentence><sentence id="1425">About that time our organization was almost -- we lost more people and some people went away and I was kind of like almost like rejected because not going to the underground, so I was left over almost like not faithful or not being part of the underground, and until the day of June 29, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1426">It was only six months later from the first massacre.</sentence><sentence id="1427">Here was lots of luck with me, lots, lots of what happened with me in this particular time.</sentence><sentence id="1428">Being a worker, a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work for the Verpflegungsamt, I too had developed a relationship with the -- well, I can't call them Nazis because this was the Verpflegungsamt, so I developed a good relationship with the two officers, the two captains of the -- there were five Germans there.</sentence><sentence id="1429">There was man by the name of Captain Miller, Captain Brauer, and then one was a Fritz, I don't remember exactly the three other plain soldiers, the ones that we were working with.</sentence><sentence id="1430">So, we were working, the eight of us <span class="NPIP">inside</span> filling the orders and the Germans were in charge.</sentence><sentence id="1431">So, we took it over -- it was -- we took over the old <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and we did our job.</sentence><sentence id="1432">We did a good work because we wanted to save our job.</sentence><sentence id="1433">It wasn't so much the dedication of being dedicated to do their slave labor, but that was our only source of our good source of bringing in healthy families and having enough food.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Until that particular day, a special Einsatzgruppen group came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with many, many Nazis with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in the day before in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and mainly they all need their rations, their food.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1435">So, where do they come?</sentence><sentence id="1436">They came into that Captain Miller, and that was on a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="1437">So, they came into him to get some rations.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Meanwhile, from the time from the first massacre to the second massacre, everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> realizing what happened the first time, if you could hide under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, if you could hide in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, maybe they didn't find you.</sentence><sentence id="1439">So, what happened was each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> tried to make malines!*.</sentence><sentence id="1440">The name of maline they called it, it's a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1441">Now, a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> could take any different kind of ways.</sentence><sentence id="1442">It could be a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> -- if you had a <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> -- with a covered <span class="DLF">entrance</span> where they couldn't find.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1443">In my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we had 32 people living.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for the 32 people.</sentence><sentence id="1445">Where was the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1446">Under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> -- was a wooden floor -- we pulled out some dirt and luckily we had a small <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and put it out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and we made in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> a special <span class="DLF">entrance</span> which was hard to recognize.</sentence><sentence id="1447">That would be the place to hide in case another Aktion would come.</sentence><sentence id="1448">We knew it was going to come.</sentence><sentence id="1449">Now, every other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had their different ways how to make where to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1450">So, I was when the news came in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the day before, that something was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1451">How did the news come in?</sentence><sentence id="1452">The traffic <span class="NPIP">outside</span> you could see.</sentence><sentence id="1453">All of a sudden some new faces, some new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> because we were on the watch-out.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1454">Everything we were looking for any signs and all of a sudden you could see the atmosphere was different <span class="NPIP">outside</span> than everyday.</sentence><sentence id="1455">So, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> are passing by, and by the way, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was divided, the main thoroughfare, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> had to pass by.</sentence><sentence id="1456">Was one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> you can walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but you could see if they could go around in different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but some Aktion was coming through.</sentence><sentence id="1457">So, we were getting ready to -- if something happens during the night or the next day -- we were getting ready to hide in this particular <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So, here, they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miller</span> with the order for food.</sentence><sentence id="1459">And especially they wanted the "8 <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> (Yiddish)</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1463">0 whiskey.</sentence><sentence id="1464">They always did it with the whiskey to get them drunk.</sentence><sentence id="1465">They could do the job without being drunk, but it helped when you gave them the schnapps, the whiskey.</sentence><sentence id="1466">So, they came in for the order, and Miller said, "I cannot do it unless you give me my eight Jews."</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1467">So, now we are his eight Jews, because they work over there in this.</sentence><sentence id="1468">The head of the commander had to get a special permit to be able to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I mean to get out that Miller should be able to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and take out the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1469">I don't know they were negotiating that what they told us later on.</sentence><sentence id="1470">They were negotiating almost all part of the evening and the next day, on Monday morning about six-thirty, Miller and the other four Germans were living right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1471">It was a nice rich -- before the war, it was a nice <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span>, so they took it over when they threw the Jews <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1472">So, Miller comes in to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he gives the order, shows the order to the guard and to the Jewish police.</sentence><sentence id="1473">The Jewish police were inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, to get Dereczynski-- that's me -- and the other people, get them together as fast as they can -- 10 minutes, 15 minutes -- to come everybody by the <span class="DLF">exit</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1474">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was small, it wasn't that far.</sentence><sentence id="1475">I get a call in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when the Jewish policeman knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1476">We were already ready to hide, and he runs and he knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> when he calls, "Miller is waiting for you outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>," otherwise I would never go out.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1477">He knocks a few times.</sentence><sentence id="1478">He said, "Dereczynski, Dereczynski, Miller wants you."</sentence><sentence id="1479">And he mentioned Miller, otherwise I would never come out.</sentence><sentence id="1480">So, I went out and here he tells me that Miller was giving me the order to get the people.</sentence><sentence id="1481">So, we got the people together and we went in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hard leaving everybody there.</sentence><sentence id="1482">Here I am going out, but this time, I didn't have no hesitation.</sentence><sentence id="1483">It was very hard to part that you are going away.</sentence><sentence id="1484">I don't know if you'll ever get back together.</sentence><sentence id="1485">But I did go out, and five minutes to seven we were there and Miller takes us out and walking out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, not going even maybe one <span class="DLF">block</span> we could see that the destruction of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is coming, because we saw like a <span class="DLF">front line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1486">Germans with machine guns all surrounded the <span

line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Now, what is that for?</sentence><sentence id="1489">Then we walked out another short while, a few minutes later, we hear a shot and the Aktion started exactly at seven o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="1490">By that time, the Judenrat was a man of one.</sentence><sentence id="1491">His name was Kwint!,</sentence><sentence id="1492">and the minute they started coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he asked them, "Where are you taking my Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1493">So, he was killed right there by the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1494">Kwint was killed right there by the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1495">I found it out later, I didn't see it.</sentence><sentence id="1496">But I could hear the shooting and then small little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> immediately you could see because we saw little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> filled with all different kinds of auxiliary forces was standing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and you could see they're getting ready.</sentence><sentence id="1497">In fact, one comes out on the way when we were walking.</sentence><sentence id="1498">One high German officer comes out from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and he stops us and he says "Where are you taking the Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1499">In fact he if "m not remember, he may have even called him "Miller."</sentence><sentence id="1500">He said "Where are you taking the Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1501">He said, "If you're not giving me the Jews, you won't have any food."</sentence><sentence id="1502">And, "Heil Hitler" and he let us go.</sentence><sentence id="1503">And they took us to the Verpflegungsamt, which was approximately one mile away and we came back to the Verpflegungsamt and in the "deg Gershon Kwint, head of the Slonim Judenrat.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1507">1 Verpflegungsamt you could already see the fire, you could hear the shooting and the killing was going on, and before the evening came they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire, because they couldn't find anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1508">Most of the Jews were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding places</span>, so they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire.</sentence><sentence id="1509">So, you could see the flames of the fire and we are sitting <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the Verpflegungsamt.</sentence><sentence id="1510">Not be able to do anything, not be able to help and not sure with our own lives. "</sentence><sentence id="1511">What are they going to do to us?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1512">When they get through with them, they're not going to let us witness, sure the next thing will be they'll probably kill us."</sentence><sentence id="1513">So, we tried to figure out maybe a way that we'll be able to run away.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1514">But, in that time, they gave us special scheins.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1515">The schein was a small little card with a stamp from the Gebietskommissar"" -- it means the governor.</sentence><sentence id="1516">There was only eight legally taken out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and I was one of the eight.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1517">And here we are sitting there and Miller comes out and everyday we used to go to the main <span class="DLF">street</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> to pick up bread for the rations.</sentence><sentence id="1518">This particular time, Miller said, I wouldn't suggest anybody should go, you could be caught right on this.</sentence><sentence id="1519">So, I did with another two fellow workers we decided we were going to go anyway in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">We'll go to the <span

see.</sentence><sentence id="1523">I wanted to see what was happening <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so I took the chance.</sentence><sentence id="1524">I went with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I passed by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I could see what's happening inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1525">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was already on fire.</sentence><sentence id="1526">People were running out from the

where they were hiding in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1529">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>, outside <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>, so they were hiding <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and they were all with the dirt, and they were caught there and they were out walking past by where it is running to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1530">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was right there, maybe to wash off and they were killed right on the way.</sentence><sentence id="1531">And other killings, you could see some dead people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was going slow.</sentence><sentence id="1532">We asked the driver, Fritz, when he passes by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to go slowly so we could witness this.</sentence><sentence id="1533">And it was happening like people were running and the old Jewish saying "fun fayer tzu vaser""!, "</sentence><sentence id="1534">from fire to water" Running from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fire</span> to get drowned in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> or killed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, and that's the view what I witnessed it, what I could see.</sentence><sentence id="1535">And I came back to the Verpflegungsamt, tremendous thinking of what are we going to do.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1536">"How are we going to survive or what can we do?"</sentence><sentence id="1537">That was going on -- but the same night he gave us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep in the Verpflegungsamt.</sentence><sentence id="1538">We didn't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1539">That was going on for two or three days, and then Miller told us that they are going to let a certain amount of Jews live.</sentence><sentence id="1540">They are not going to kill out the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And later on we found out they did the same thing all over.</sentence><sentence id="1542">They never killed out in the first or second time until the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Our experience showed later too, they did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1544">Mainly the ones, the people that are hiding, is you let some other people live.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So, the people, the ones that are hiding would come out and then you make it from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of 10 <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, you make the five <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, from five <span class="DLF">blocks</span> to 10 <span

it.</sentence><sentence id="1552">They don't have the 10 <span class="DLF">blocks</span>, what they had, or 20 <span class="DLF">blocks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I found it out later that that was what was done in every type of <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1554">So, they left.</sentence><sentence id="1555">They left, the word was coming out they were going to let some Jews live.</sentence><sentence id="1556">It's not going to be completely liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="1557">So, what do I do?</sentence><sentence id="1558">I'm <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1559">My family is still <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1560">Lisa is still <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1561">I have no idea what happened with them.</sentence><sentence id="1562">And I'm being there on the third day and I came to Miller, and I say, "I have a good idea for you."</sentence><sentence id="1563">And he, during the time with Miller, I bartered before too.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And he always used to ask me if I could get him certain different kinds of items to bring from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he'll pay me to send, probably send it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1565">Meanwhile, the night when this was happening, I noticed that Brauer, the other officer, he was kind of completely disturbed with the happenings.</sentence><sentence id="1566">It was only one German what I ever met, what I could see that he was disturbed with it.</sentence><sentence id="1567">And I see him staying on the, on the -- we hada lot of sacks and he is staying over there leaned on the sack with hands like this [interviewee gestures with both hands on head] and he said "I can't believe it that my people can kill and burn this."</sentence><sentence id="1568">And he was talking to himself.</sentence><sentence id="1569">And I just make it like I wasn't there around.</sentence><sentence id="1570">So, the next time, when a couple days later when Miller gave me the permit, I told him, I said, "You get me a permit to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1571">The Aktion was still going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1572">[Technical conversation}</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1576">3 Tape 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1577">A: After the second and third day, people were hiding inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and they could not find anybody, and they put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on fire.</sentence><sentence id="1578">And then, a day later or two, they started announcing with the loud speakers that the Aktion is over and that anybody who comes out will get scheins, and they're not going to take them away.</sentence><sentence id="1579">By that time, some people were start already, coming out, so when they came out they immediately arrested them and they took them over in the <span class="DLF">jail yard</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1580">When I was working on my <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I found out that some people are going to be allowed to live, so I went to Miller when I offered him a proposition that if he would someway get me transportation to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I would go inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and find for him anything what he would like.</sentence><sentence id="1581">For example, he wanted all the time, he wanted -- at that time there wasn't too much valuables you could find.</sentence><sentence id="1582">I mean if people had small stuff they took with them whatever, but the bigger items, crystals, all different kinds of dishes, maybe some furs, this kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1583">So he fell for the idea and he says, "All right.</sentence><sentence id="1584">I'm going to get you a special permission to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1585">In the afternoon, I asked him in the morning, a short while after, maybe an hour or two hours later, he came back with a piece of paper, with a permit to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he said "Fritz will take you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1586">He'll drop you off right inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and whatever you accumulate all different valuable stuff that you can find, you'll come to the front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>" -- what's the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and the <span class="DLF">exit</span>, it's only one <span class="DLF">gate</span> -- ""you'll come right by the exit of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and you'll take it over to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1587">He lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1588">So, I was very happy to do it, and my intention was mainly was if I could go ahead <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and maybe I'll be able to find my family inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and Lisa, whatever I can do and help and see -- "I'll decide what I can do later."</sentence><sentence id="1589">He dropped us off, four of us.</sentence><sentence id="1590">He dropped the four of us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and it was still going on some of the Germans were still walking around inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to rob, to look for something to take it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, to rob, to take away.</sentence><sentence id="1591">And but in the same time we are afraid that we shouldn't be arrested in taking like some of the survivors, so we all stayed together in one group with the document what we had.</sentence><sentence id="1592">So, we came, we walked through part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we split up.</sentence><sentence id="1593">Each one went to see if he could find anybody from their family.</sentence><sentence id="1594">I immediately went to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived and I knew exactly the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> or the hidden <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1595">I knocked a few times until I got an answer and sure enough everybody was still there, and it was the people that were there.</sentence><sentence id="1596">I found out it was 32 people were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1597">They opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and it was three, we found three dead people.</sentence><sentence id="1598">The three dead people they committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1599">It was a druggist, and he was fortunate to have some poison, so his family took the poison.</sentence><sentence id="1600">And the stench it was!I couldn't walk in, <span class="NPIP">inside</span> but some way I went <span class="NPIP">underneath</span> and here the people were laying over there for three or four days under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with no lights and they couldn't even move.</sentence><sentence id="1601">They couldn't stay on their feet, if they would come out in the <span class="DLF">open</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1602">By some way I got <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and I had a chance to see my mother and my three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="1603">I couldn't help them with doing the taking out.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Whom would you take out?</sentence><sentence id="1605">If I could take maybe one, I would have a terrible decision even to take one.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Whom to take?</sentence><sentence id="1607">Whom to take?</sentence><sentence id="1608">And but I gave them, I found some food.</sentence><sentence id="1609">I brought in some bread and water.</sentence><sentence id="1610">The food that I found is because there was some food in the</sentence><sentence id="1612">4 empty <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where they took out the people.</sentence><sentence id="1613">I could still find some bread and what mainly was the water.</sentence><sentence id="1614">So, I gave them the water and the bread and I gave them, and I said, "We'll see what we can do the next chance I'll have."</sentence><sentence id="1615">I figured to myself "that's what I'll do."</sentence><sentence id="1616">And I left them.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And from there walking <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I met my other friends, the ones that worked with me.</sentence><sentence id="1618">Nobody had anybody of their families.</sentence><sentence id="1619">Their families were discovered and they didn't have found anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1620">So on the way walking out, I had to pass by the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Lisa lives, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1621">And here, I tell my people, and they were carrying the dishes, whatever we found we put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow cases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1622">We didn't have any boxes.</sentence><sentence id="1623">We put them in pillowcases.</sentence><sentence id="1624">So, I was standing over there and they're waiting and I say, "Give me a chance, let me take a look if my friend is there."</sentence><sentence id="1625">I came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and she wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1626">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> next to them was a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1627">It looked like the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was discovered.</sentence><sentence id="1628">And, you could see a hand grenade blew up the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1629">I still didn't give up.</sentence><sentence id="1630">I went to the back and I think, "Maybe they went in the back to hide."</sentence><sentence id="1631">So, I go in the back and I start calling out "Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa."</sentence><sentence id="1632">And sure enough it, didn't take too long and an answer came out, and Lisa was there.</sentence><sentence id="1633">She was hiding in a small little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, a wooden <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, very easy to discover, very easy to burn, but somebody was behind them upstairs and they kept the <span class="NPIP">place</span> intact.</sentence><sentence id="1634">It was not on fire.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And she came down, and I made immediately my decision I made up, that I'm going to take her with me.</sentence><sentence id="1636">But how did I take her out?</sentence><sentence id="1637">Women were not allowed to leave yet, because the people, the ones they left was only men around them when they saw.</sentence><sentence id="1638">It was no women.</sentence><sentence id="1639">So, what I did is I went right next door, in fact in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I met my friend, the one who introduced me to Lisa.</sentence><sentence id="1640">I went upstairs in their little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1641">I found men's clothes, a pair of pants and a jacket and a cap.</sentence><sentence id="1642">I took her in there.</sentence><sentence id="1643">I cut her hair, and I put on a pair of pants and a jacket on top of her old clothes which she had, and the cap, and she cried.</sentence><sentence id="1644">I mean, her hair she never cut since she was born probably, but she was happy and excited, and at the same time she's leaving her brother and her father in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, but she took the chance that she went with me.</sentence><sentence id="1645">Now, what I did was I gave her my schein, the passport to leave the little piece of paper and hoping in case if I'm caught Miller will some way take me out.</sentence><sentence id="1646">So, we're all getting ready to walk out, and we find a couple chandeliers, old broken things with wires.</sentence><sentence id="1647">I figure it's a good thing to keep it how to mask her up, she wouldn't be recognized.</sentence><sentence id="1648">So I put on the one fellow, I put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chandelier</span> with wires, we didn't have much BX" with, with all different kinds of wires.</sentence><sentence id="1649">The same thing I did with Lisa, and here we're walking.</sentence><sentence id="1650">There are five of us now with the bags and carrying the bags.</sentence><sentence id="1651">We're coming out to the <span class="DLF">exit</span> and here the Germans are watching.</sentence><sentence id="1652">I take the piece of paper and say "Here's my four men."</sentence><sentence id="1653">And they took a look at us -- they didn't even check -- look on the paper, four or five, they didn't pay any attention, and they let us out and we walked right across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the Germans live.</sentence><sentence id="1654">We're coming in over there and Miller in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it's the middle, or late in the 2 BX cable</sentence><sentence id="1656">5 day, and Miller was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so I walk up to Miller, excited to join him with the bags of the goods that I brought him in, and I tell him I found my sister -- can he help me to save my sister?He gets enraged and he hits his hands on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and says "This is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1657">Get her out immediately."</sentence><sentence id="1658">I had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="1659">I put her down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> over there and I let her in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and I figured maybe I'll be able to see if I can talk to Bauer.</sentence><sentence id="1660">So, I wait for a while there, being over there and Miller took off.</sentence><sentence id="1661">He went back to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and Bauer was there.</sentence><sentence id="1662">So, I walk up to Bauer and I say, "Captain Bauer," I say, "I found my sister, can you help me?"</sentence><sentence id="1663">He says, "Where is she?"</sentence><sentence id="1664">| said, "She's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1665">He says, "Don't worry, I'll help you."</sentence><sentence id="1666">And he goes down with me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and Lisa sits in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1667">It was filled up with old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, and she's laying like a little cat all rolled up scared to death and she was small.</sentence><sentence id="1668">She wasn't a big girl.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And Bauer walks over and tells her, "Stand up."</sentence><sentence id="1670">And she's scared and she stands up and he says, "You're not a boy."</sentence><sentence id="1671">And he looks at her and so she just says, "No."</sentence><sentence id="1672">And he says, "Do you have your girl's clothes?"</sentence><sentence id="1673">And she says, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1674">He said, "Take off the boy's clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1675">Take off everything that you have, and be back in your old clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1676">The only thing is don't have your the latte", the Jewish sign, yellow star, the yellow square, round piece."</sentence><sentence id="1677">Anyway, and he told her "come up upstairs" and there were Jewish -- one of our eight that worked like steady.</sentence><sentence id="1678">He was cleaning the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the -- for them and helping them <span class="NPIP">inside</span> like a slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And he came down and they brought her down a babushka with her hair in a babushka and he took her out from there and he told her he says, "I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt."</sentence><sentence id="1680">We left with Fritz.</sentence><sentence id="1681">Fritz took us over with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> he took us back to the Verpflegungsamt and Lisa was left over there and Bauer took her to the Verpflegungsamt.</sentence><sentence id="1682">He walked with her and he told her to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> -- no more like on the <span class="DLF">street</span> -- and "just walk like you're a Polish girl."</sentence><sentence id="1683">And in case -- that was his words, "in case the Black Guard is going to stop you" -- the Black Guard was the police from the Ukrainians or somebody with the forces when they come in -- he said, "I'm going to kill him right on the way."</sentence><sentence id="1684">And he walked with her to the <span class="BUILDING">Verpflegungsamt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1685">I was over there already with my other helpers, but I was expecting her to come, so I made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the Verpflegungsamt.</sentence><sentence id="1686">I only had the problem; how do we bring her in?</sentence><sentence id="1687">We smuggled her in someway, <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, the other Jews that are our friends helped me to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> here in the Verpflegungsamt and the Verpflegungsamt was hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of sacks of all different of flours and sugar, all different kinds of foods, and it was packed in five or six, stacked like an army of soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1688">So, I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to -- I took out a few sacks, and I made a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and that was where she was hidden there for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="1689">And then later on I got a schein for Lisa, the same little passport.</sentence><sentence id="1690">I was transferred to a different Verpflegungsamt to the other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beutelager</span> where I worked before.</sentence><sentence id="1691">We left that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could now live.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And Lisa was left over the night, for the night by herself.</sentence><sentence id="1693">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> with food with rats and everything right over there, and she stayed there during the night.</sentence><sentence id="1694">I came a couple times during the day to visit her until she got the schein and then after I took her over to the Beutelager.</sentence><sentence id="1695">Two days later she went to the <span

id="1700">I paid off Miller.</sentence><sentence id="1701">He came in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, Miller now, I came in with him, and we came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my family and the rest of them were hidden.</sentence><sentence id="1702">By that time we found only approximately about 14 or 15 people.</sentence><sentence id="1703">The young men, the young people, walked -- went out from there.</sentence><sentence id="1704">I don't know if they survived or didn't survive, but they left the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1705">We were in a covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with canvas, a canvas covered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1706">I took out my family and the rest of the people.</sentence><sentence id="1707">The rest of the people had money to pay him off.</sentence><sentence id="1708">They had valuables.</sentence><sentence id="1709">They were pretty rich from before.</sentence><sentence id="1710">When we're talking rich, we're talking maybe they had a couple coins.</sentence><sentence id="1711">But that kind of richness that we talk, we're not talking here for diamonds and big, big, big items, but it was enough because I promised Miller that, "They are going to pay you off.</sentence><sentence id="1712">They are going to give it to you."</sentence><sentence id="1713">So, I had to stand with my word, otherwise he could kill me too, if he would take him out and not get paid, he would take me out and shot, because that same Miller was a killer before.</sentence><sentence id="1714">He took part in Aktions in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1715">We found it out.</sentence><sentence id="1716">We knew it.</sentence><sentence id="1717">So, being good to me this particular time, helping me, it was me -- it wasn't-- the next Jew he would kill him cold in blood.</sentence><sentence id="1718">So, I was trying to make it sure they will have money to pay him.</sentence><sentence id="1719">So, I took them over to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Lisa was, but she couldn't be in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but next to it was another <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and they were hiding over there, staying there for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1720">The next day Miller gave them all scheins.</sentence><sentence id="1721">By that time everybody could get a schein.</sentence><sentence id="1722">They could go out in the <span class="DLF">open</span> at that time and get a schein.</sentence><sentence id="1723">By that time there was no more killing.</sentence><sentence id="1724">As far as I think and I'm concerned there were no favors.</sentence><sentence id="1725">But that time was a time, like I said before, they decided they were going to let some of the Jews live.</sentence><sentence id="1726">So, it was done almost only to enrich his pocket.</sentence><sentence id="1727">He knew it was no big deal what he did, but he did it anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And we stayed over there -- by that time there was left over approximately 900, 1,000 Jews out of 20,000.</sentence><sentence id="1729">In a short time, we had every night to get up in the middle of the night to be counted, but I made my way out from there to go to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1730">I did the same thing and Lisa did the same way in two different times.</sentence><sentence id="1731">We were separated for a short time.</sentence><sentence id="1732">I went with my mother and three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="1733">In fact, Lisa, with her father and brother, left a couple days before.</sentence><sentence id="1734">Where did we go when I left a couple days later?</sentence><sentence id="1735">A friend of mine knew a farm lady.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And the farm lady would take us in a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with the name of a

even know much about what the Third Reich meant -- that in this Pruzhana(r)*, Volkovysk, Bialystok, Grodno, this part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that there is no killing over there and that the Jews are still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1738">So, we went with this farm lady.</sentence><sentence id="1739">They found her.</sentence><sentence id="1740">She took us in a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">She couldn't take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruzhana</span> she took us to <span

more refugees were there.</sentence><sentence id="1746">I asked the people in the Judenrat if you saw a girl with a young brother, with a young kid -- her brother was 11 years 24 Pruzhany deg5 Pruzhany</sentence><sentence id="1748">7 old, 12 years old, 12 years old not quite 13, because 13, it was a year later, bar mitzvah -- and the father, the father was an older man.</sentence><sentence

life.</sentence><sentence id="1752">I had to make the -- and it flashed through my thinking, a backflash, "Did I do right in not going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, going back to my family?</sentence><sentence id="1753">And here I'm at the <span class="DLF">crossroads</span>, should I go with my family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> or should I go single,

class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1755">It partly was my mind to break away from the family, because if the only chance I have is to survive is not to stay together.</sentence><sentence id="1756">When you stay together you only perish together.</sentence><sentence id="1757">There is no way that a family would be able to survive, so I made the decision that I'm going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">And that's the last time I saw my family anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1759">I left them, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1760">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.155" long="24.446">Volkovysk</span>, was the place where we split up, the Judenrat helped me

long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> probably to, whatever, deliver or pick it up.</sentence><sentence id="1763">So, I was hidden between on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> until I arrived in

time I think it was in August of 19-- it was June, no probably in August of 1942, I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1767"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> was completely relaxed like hardly -- it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but a very relaxed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1768">You could go in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1769">It was no killing.</sentence><sentence id="1770">It was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1771">For me, it was almost like coming in like a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1772">I'm sure Aktions happened to the time but I wasn't aware, because I wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1773">So, I can't say that nothing happened there anything before, but the way it looked to me -- coming in from the massacres and coming in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where it's quiet and people are moving around and in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you could see business going on, on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, what was the business?</sentence><sentence id="1774">Selling old clothes, selling a pair of pants, buying a pair of shoes, you couldn't even buy food on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1775">So, for us, for me it was -- I couldn't even believe that things could happen not only what was it, 70, 100 kilometers from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1776">I thought to myself, "I wish everybody else would know about it.</sentence><sentence id="1777">Maybe a lot of people would try from before."</sentence><sentence id="1778">Well, it was going on like this.</sentence><sentence id="1779">I found Lisa.</sentence><sentence id="1780">Lisa was there with her father.</sentence><sentence id="1781">They lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and they took me in.</sentence><sentence id="1782">I lived with them.</sentence><sentence id="1783">I made my own friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1784">And my main purpose was only one thing is, "How do I get in touch with the underground?"</sentence><sentence id="1785">I'm single, I'm by myself.</sentence><sentence id="1786">Single, I mean I'm not married.</sentence><sentence id="1787">I'm not attached, and that was a tremendous plus.</sentence><sentence id="1788">And how can I find a way with the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1789">The first thing I start looking to a Ha-Shomer ha-Za'ir, the Zionist organization, nothing helped.</sentence><sentence id="1790">Being over there I couldn't get in touch with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1791">After the war I found out it was an underground organization there.</sentence><sentence id="1792">But it was so secretive and being a stranger in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was impossible to get in touch.</sentence><sentence id="1793">So, here I am looking around, walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to talk to different kinds of friends and people had jobs and this, and I could in no, no way I could get in touch with the underground.</sentence><sentence id="1794">So, in being there, by November first there came in an order from the Gestapo to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1795"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto one</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto two</span>, they decided to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1798">8 That means from now on the Gestapo took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1799">If you had to go in or out, you had to have orders from the Gestapo, and it was getting on the same order that Slonim was from before.</sentence><sentence id="1800">So, we are caught now with a population only one difference was, I'm an experienced person in people would have no idea what killing means or destruction means.</sentence><sentence id="1801">I'm here, I felt myself, "I'm experienced -- young and experienced, maybe I'll have a chance, find some other ways."</sentence><sentence id="1802">When they blocked up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> it was hard to go out for work.</sentence><sentence id="1803">You had special permissions.</sentence><sentence id="1804">People went out to work and it didn't take too long they're asking for two transportation, resettlement started.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And the name was -- they are taking them out to work, and the <span class="NPIP">places</span> would be much better, because here already, hunger started.</sentence><sentence id="1806">A lot of people ran out of anything to sell or any valuables to be able to barter to change out.</sentence><sentence id="1807">You had to live only on the rations what you were getting, and that wasn't much.</sentence><sentence id="1808">Rations weren't too great, too big, too much.</sentence><sentence id="1809">And they were the order to get 2,000 Jews for resettlement.</sentence><sentence id="1810">So, they put out officially signs, I don't remember, with names or no names, but they said, "Take your best clothes, take your warm clothes, it might be cold.</sentence><sentence id="1811">Take your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toothbrushes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1812">Take you food for two days.</sentence><sentence id="1813">Take as much as you can carry in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">suitcase</span> or whatever it is."</sentence><sentence id="1814">They made us believe that they are taking you to a resettlement, but with my experience, I knew.</sentence><sentence id="1815">So, here I thought, "We are going to be the first ones on the list, because we are the outsiders."</sentence><sentence id="1816">And sure enough they came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1817">We were first on the list.</sentence><sentence id="1818">I was first on the list, Lisa was the first, the whole family is.</sentence><sentence id="1819">But that's all I had to do was I was hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1820">When they came and looked for me, I wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1821">So, they took other people.</sentence><sentence id="1822">They filled the quota with some other people.</sentence><sentence id="1823">But I survived this first time.</sentence><sentence id="1824">And that way it was going on, day after day, quiet and then another Aktion, and then another Aktion.</sentence><sentence id="1825">And meanwhile, we start building malines, <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>, the same thing as this and here I became an expert.</sentence><sentence id="1826">People started knowing of me, what I went through, and now all of sudden they were getting interested, "How did you survive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1827">Before, people didn't want to hear it. "</sentence><sentence id="1828">How did you survive?"</sentence><sentence id="1829">So I told them this.</sentence><sentence id="1830">So, they called me in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> how to build <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1831">So, the one benefit that I got is I knew the <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">Helping them, I knew the <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1833">So, when it came up a big Aktion when they took only four or five days, I was hiding, they took out I don't know maybe 10,000.</sentence><sentence id="1834">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> had 29,000 Jews at this time.</sentence><sentence id="1835">The vicinity around had another 10,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1836">So, now I'm part of the 29,000.</sentence><sentence id="1837">So they took out one, one time, they took out in four or five days, another 10,000 and we were hiding in five different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1838">We were there, stayed there for 10 or 15 minutes, "I don't like it.</sentence><sentence id="1839">Too many kids, it's not enough <span class="DLF">air</span>, its maybe it's...," someway I had the feeling they were going to discover it.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And sure enough we went through five days.</sentence><sentence id="1841">I don't know how we survived, but we did survive.</sentence><sentence id="1842">How we survived the last time?</sentence><sentence id="1843">The last time we survived after we went out from different <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and it turns out they discovered, I don't know, not all of them, but most of them were discovered, but the last time is, we were hiding in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, a broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, what the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was checked and looked maybe a 100 times and that we figured that is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1844">Because by now they are not going to look under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1845">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open.</sentence><sentence id="1846">The pillows and everything was all thrown out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1847">We figured</sentence><sentence id="1849">9 anybody walked in it only took a second to walk out, because they all realized that, "Hey, somebody was here already.</sentence><sentence id="1850">Somebody before, they took out the people."</sentence><sentence id="1851">And we survived under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">After that it was -- I do not know exactly how many people were left over -- but it was in December, I found a job to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1853">In the meanwhile, being inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where I lived, I befriended with a very dear friend.</sentence><sentence id="1854">He became a dear friend after, and his name was Herschel Lipszyc.</sentence><sentence id="1855">And very nice person, very nice young man and he probably treated me like a brother.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And I was so involved with him, and every <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was going to work, he was asking me, "Why don't you join me to work?"</sentence><sentence id="1857">And here, it came out in December, he tells me, "Aron you're very handy.</sentence><sentence id="1858">Why don't you be an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="1859">We need an electrician."</sentence><sentence id="1860">I was a carpenter, an electrician, a shoemaker, anything what we need.</sentence><sentence id="1861">When you're handy, it's not hard to become anything.</sentence><sentence id="1862">I mean, you're not an expert at that, but at least you know how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1863">And he tells me that, "We need an electrician so maybe I can arrange that you can go out and they will hire you."</sentence><sentence id="1864">You can not just go with him and be an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="1865">You have a foreman, the foreman has to accept you to take you out over there to work.</sentence><sentence id="1866">So, he went to the foreman and he told him, "I have for you a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1867">He's an electrician, and he'll go out with you.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Let him come to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1869">So, on that wintry day I went out to work with Herschel, and we were working with about five people, and what we are doing we were remodeling a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a Gestapo, a <span class="BUILDING">private home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1870">So, we were remodeling the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so I was supposed to be an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="1871">Before when in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> knowing about electricity, so I knew a little bit how to work with electricity, and being over there we got acquainted with a Polish young fellow and his name was Tadeusz Soroka.</sentence><sentence id="1872">He used to come and the same thing, to barter.</sentence><sentence id="1873">He used to bring us food, and we in turn would bring him clothes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and change and this way we could bring in some food.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Herschel, my friend, knew him very much better.</sentence><sentence id="1875">He knew him before the time.</sentence><sentence id="1876">So, he got real friendly with him.</sentence><sentence id="1877">My friend Herschel Lipszyc didn't look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1878">He was a little blondish looking, so Tadek, this Polish fellow tells him, "I have a connections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> and over there I will be able to get you papers, Aryan papers so you'll be able to live as a non-Jew <span class="NPIP">outside</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1879">Herschel agreed to it with another friend of his Lutek, and they made their arrangements with Tadek -- that Tadek is going to take them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1880">It's 180 kilometers, he's going to take him over there.</sentence><sentence id="1881">They made up a certain time, and Hershel is supposed to send me a note if they come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, if they came safe to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1882">Because a lot times it was going on, somebody could take away from you -- we didn't have any money, I didn't have much money-- but to give out to the Nazis you would get a pound of sugar for it, or you would get some other food stuff for it, rewards for it.</sentence><sentence id="1883">So, I wasn't sure. "</sentence><sentence id="1884">Why would a Polish fellow just be so nice and do it for them?"</sentence><sentence id="1885">So we were kind of suspicious, I mean, whatever behind is or is it not, so we asked him for a note.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And Hershel left.</sentence><sentence id="1887">I helped Hershel get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1888">I cut the</sentence><sentence id="1890">0 wires for him.</sentence><sentence id="1891">I was the last one to say goodbye to him.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And we kissed and hugged and, "We'll see you someday in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1893">And he left.</sentence><sentence id="1894">A few days later, Tadek comes to me and he says, "I don't have a note."</sentence><sentence id="1895">He says, "It happened, he couldn't stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, he went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1896">It started raining, and I couldn't stay long enough and I have no note."</sentence><sentence id="1897">I worried about it and I didn't know if I should ever take a chance with him or not.</sentence><sentence id="1898">We went through another day or two, a few days later and Tadek cames -- comes again to me, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was working, and he says, "Aron, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is surrounded with heavy guards and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>,

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2484">A: In the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, during the day, I'm still looking around to see if I can find Lisa, and I was looking at other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, maybe I can find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="2485">It's late in the day, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was already packed again, and Lisa was still not there.</sentence><sentence id="2486">I looked around for a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, maybe I can still find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to hide.</sentence><sentence id="2487">And in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I was looking and I see a small little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that used to be the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2488">I jump in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I see a young man is making a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> under a pile of coal.</sentence><sentence id="2489">There was a pile of coal, blocks of coal.</sentence><sentence id="2490">He was making -- trying to build a way how to hide under the coal.</sentence><sentence id="2491">I walked up to him and started begging him and asking him to let me make a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, together maybe we can make a <span class="NPIP">place</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="2492">After a hard bargaining with him and asking him and pleading with him, I told him that I am a survivor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.083" long="25.317">Slonim</span>, I have some luck with me.

made a <span class="DLF">roof</span> on top of the blocks, two walls of coal blocks and we made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> underneath and covered the <span class="DLF">roof</span> with

and they were killed over there.</sentence><sentence id="2508">So, we found a couple bodies in.</sentence><sentence id="2509">We were hiding there <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, all of us, and during the night and the next morning, we hear the same thing what's happening the day before.</sentence><sentence id="2510">The Nazis came in.</sentence><sentence id="2511">They took out the people

id="2541">Lisa made the arrangements.</sentence><sentence id="2542">She went to him one time and then she went to him a second time and she met him at <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and he told

id="2544">We followed his directions.</sentence><sentence id="2545">We came out on a Tuesday night, but I want to turn back to one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2546">It's very important.</sentence><sentence id="2547">We came out Sunday before, and we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">janitor house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2548">We were a total of us eight or nine.</sentence><sentence id="2549">The janitor didn't keep us, so he took us to bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2550">And we stayed -- he didn't keep us.</sentence><sentence id="2551">The idea was to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span>, and from the <span class="BUILDING">janitors house</span> we'll make a contact with Tadek

evening.</sentence><sentence id="2562">But that day Lisa made a contact with Tadek, and she came back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="2563">She knew where it was because when we went to the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, Lisa went with all of us, with the janitor so in case she'll need us, she'll know where we're hiding.</sentence><sentence id="2564">But the point that I want to make here is Tadek came and said he cannot take us tonight.</sentence><sentence id="2565">He may take us a day or two nights later.</sentence><sentence id="2566">We could not stay one night outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2567">It was more safer for us to go through the <span class="DLF">wires</span> to go back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the next day to go back out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and walk again, then to stay one day hiding in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2568">Because the population was so unfriendly and so Antisemitic that if a small little</sentence><sentence
