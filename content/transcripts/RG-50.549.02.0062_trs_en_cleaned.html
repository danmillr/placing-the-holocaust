<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: I'm just going to listen to it.</sentence><sentence id="11">Okay, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</sentence><sentence id="12">This is an interview with Mr. Harold Zissman, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on February 28", 2000.</sentence><sentence id="13">And this is a follow up interview, it's a post -- focusing on post-Holocaust era -- it's a follow up interview to an interview that we conducted with Harold Zissman, in 1995.</sentence><sentence id="14">That was a Holocaust era interview, conducted on videotape.</sentence><sentence id="15">And we're going to start by reviewing some -- some things that -- that took place immediately following the war, and then move on to what happened in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, which will be our focus today.</sentence><sentence id="16">So, one of the first things that I wanted to know was when you -- in the last interview, that Randy Goldman conducted with you, it wasn't</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="27">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 3 very clear to me what liberation meant, and whether there was a moment when you were actually liberated, when you were recognizing, okay, I'm not responsible for being platoon commander any more, and I'm -- I'm a -- now I have to decide what comes next.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="28">Can you describe that a little more?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Of course.</sentence><sentence id="30">That was a very hard thing at the time, turning the clock back to the era.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="31">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> sort of served as -- as a safety, away from the people who wanted my life, sort of -- without a gu -- good reason.</sentence><sentence id="32">Therefore, my separation from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was a very hard one to do.</sentence><sentence id="33">The commanding officer that particular time, when asked by two of my for -- comrades who were in my platoon, ask me why am I not going out to join them, and see where I can enlist myself to do a jo -- to work, well he told them, "Where do you think Harold is going to go?</sentence><sentence id="34">Is he going to enlist himself to be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police</span>?</sentence><sentence id="35">No, I don't think I want him to be there, I want him to be in a more important job."</sentence><sentence id="36">Whereupon, not so long after that, I'm getting an assignment to go to -- and take some people that they immediately drafted, between the ages of 18 through 45, to join the Red Army's armed forces.</sentence><sentence id="37">And be for the fact that the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marstee</span>, were not ready, because we, the partisans, the yesterday's destroyers of that, to s -- to not let the Germans be able to carry on their war, now had a problem of going back to see that they've all repaired, so the Red Army could be able to bring in their supplies, as well as manpower.</sentence><sentence id="38">So, they were drafted and I could -- well, was ordered to organize a -- another squad because I could -- I did not have enough to make a platoon, because everybody</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="42">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 4 was trying to get organized, and they [indecipherable] me to do it.</sentence><sentence id="43">So I must have gone about maybe 10 or 12 guys, and with that I started, and I reported to duty.</sentence><sentence id="44">And with bayonets open, we were marching them like they were prisoners, much rather than they were the people who are willing to serve, and go to fight the war, to liberate the rest of them, be the end of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">It made a bad impression on me, but an order is an order, I had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, freedom at that particular time to me, I did not even get taste of the freedom yet.</sentence><sentence id="47">I can only explain myself that those same people that I have to guard -- I had to guard at the time to take them, still had in them that anti-Semitism, although I didn't do anything against those people.</sentence><sentence id="48">They couldn't accuse me personally, but a pluralistic way of hate, because I was a Jew, didna -- still was imbedded in them, and I felt the non-safety there.</sentence><sentence id="49">It took us al -- it took us almost until we put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and we go -- and we were able to move, was almost a week before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> could start operating.</sentence><sentence id="50">And as soon we reached the old <span class="DLF">border</span> between the <span class="COUNTRY">US</span>. --</sentence><sentence id="51">between the Soviet Union, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the KGB -- the army KGB took over command, and I was getting papers to be released with my squad that I had over there, and to go back to our -- well, I was told while living, where the officers are going to be, the local officers.</sentence><sentence id="52">However, I was told by my commanding officers, if I should return, and they will not be there any more.</sentence><sentence id="53">The staff -- the general staff will be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>, which was the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span>, and I am to report to any of those <span class="NPIP">places</span>, after my assignment will be done.</sentence><sentence id="54">Whereupon --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="58"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: So we got some of that -- that -- we got the information about how you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: -- in the first interview.</sentence><sentence id="63">I just wanted to clarify a little bit that -- how you knew, okay, I'm not beholden to the partisan group any more.</sentence><sentence id="64">Now I have to just make my decision about what comes next, and -- and I was trying to get a sense of what you were thinking you -- you would do next, before you got in -- involved with the KGB.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well, that's what it was at that particular time, our returning back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> was used, since I had papers to be housed, and to be fed.</sentence><sentence id="69">So it was sort of used like vacationing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">After all, now we are free birds on ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="71">From my whole squad, I only remained three of -- two of the former guys, which they were <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span>, and I was their command por -- before I was their platoon commander, and now they were with me.</sentence><sentence id="72">They were sort of more like friends that we knew during the war, and during the partisans, when I would come in their settlement, they parents knew me, and as a matter of fact, I felt relief to be in their company, because relieve means secure.</sentence><sentence id="73">I was secure that no foul things could happen towards me in that particular <span class="NPIP">time</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">So, we all went to that particular time, I received my medals, well I -- well I already said, being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and all of a sudden, I found myself that I'm going to work for the KGB, which this was the farthest thing of my mind that I ever expected to happen.</sentence><sentence id="75">But I am the -- took soldiering before, when I escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and I figured I'm continuing the same way.</sentence><sentence id="76">Besides that, I know the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="80">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 6 consequences, what it would have been had I refused, and I would not want to become a KGB working person.</sentence><sentence id="81">However, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span>, which that was sort of the re-region to where I was going to work, in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there, and I passed all the tests they wanted me to know, I told them that I wanted to go now for a little bit vacation with the two guys that they enlisted themselves in the militia, and not in the KGB, because their education was below mine, and therefore they wouldn't pass to go into the KGB.</sentence><sentence id="82">And I wanted to go back to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">Besides, I wanted, by any chance of all, maybe there was someone of my family, who by -- by any kind of way, survived, and if anything, probably that would be the place to meet them.</sentence><sentence id="84">On the other hand, I was separated from the partisans, the Jewish partisans, who were natives of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span> -- of that -- of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was that I escaped to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">I had my desire to go ahead to meet them, because we were separated, since I joined the other <span class="NPIP">part</span>, which it was in arvens, which I mean the paratroopers, with the General kus -- with General Kustenko.</sentence><sentence id="86">So I was separated from all my past, sort of, in -- in spirit, as well as physically, and I was anxious to go there.</sentence><sentence id="87">So when I put it out that I want to go for two weeks, I was granted, and meaning granted at that particular time, you had to have a permit, otherwise, without a permit, you could have been arrested easily, and who knows where to -- you could wind up.</sentence><sentence id="88">So -- and I came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of -- Volodya was the guy's name, and his cousin, and I was greeted like I would have been his brother, no | -- no less.</sentence><sentence id="89">His mother and sister were there with open arms, and we kissed each other, and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="93">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 7 hugged each other, that we survived, and came not injured.</sentence><sentence id="94">And his mother gave him to change of her clothing, she gave me.</sentence><sentence id="95">And the next thing, we went that evening cut -- in the fi -- in the settlement there.</sentence><sentence id="96">A guy was playing on the harmonica, we were dancing, the boys and the girls, and to me, while we started to drink, is the usual way it would have been at the time, and it was -- i1-it was not regular vodka, it was homemade brew, sort of, to speak.</sentence><sentence id="97">And I don't know, no matter what I drank, somehow or other, I didn't get drunk.</sentence><sentence id="98">My mind was so busy think -- to think, where do I go from here?</sentence><sentence id="99">And it's not any other way that I could explain this, I just did not have a resoluting, I want to go and do this, I want to go look to do this.</sentence><sentence id="100">In a way, I felt sorry for myself immediately.</sentence><sentence id="101">Look, here [indecipherable] he had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to come, he had a mother, he had a sister, he had cousins, he had -- what about me?</sentence><sentence id="102">I did not have anyone in -- or anywhere's to turn, to say to myself, I'm happy.</sentence><sentence id="103">We met, we are good.</sentence><sentence id="104">But everything was sort of like it would not have been real.</sentence><sentence id="105">It just like a fantasy that you dream about, or stuff like this here.</sentence><sentence id="106">So I, again, was very mixed.</sentence><sentence id="107">I worked with him a whole week on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">It was potatoes they do, because at the time of year.</sentence><sentence id="109">It's September when we are talking about, and at that particular time, farmers pick the potatoes there, and so on, because the other grain was already picked.</sentence><sentence id="110">And really, the need for help was in -- in a very bad way, because his mother an-and -- and his sister could not attend to it.</sentence><sentence id="111">So in a way, I was a handy helper, hel -- helping hand there.</sentence><sentence id="112">And to me at that particular time, a certain fantasy got into my mind again, why would I want to continue as a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="113">And immediately I saw a -- a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="117">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 8 different <span class="DLF">horizon</span>, sort of, in a way of speak.</sentence><sentence id="118">Look at it.</sentence><sentence id="119">We both for the war, he was against Nazism, he escaped to the partisans because he did not want to be drafted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to work with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="120">But look what had happened to the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="121">I had no one to come to, he comes back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">And he going and working, and coming at night, between meeting up with the boys and the girls.</sentence><sentence id="123">Like I say, a certain fantasy, I -- I call it the fantasy, because real, I was not looking for that.</sentence><sentence id="124">So I must call it a fantasy got into my mind, and that's what I thought, who knows?</sentence><sentence id="125">Maybe I'm going to get lost right now to these new world, and forget about the world that I lived in.</sentence><sentence id="126">And come Friday, the whole thing came to a change, whereupon Volodya says to me, "Harold, aren't you going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="127"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span> meaning the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> nearby -- not so nearby, but from where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="128">And he knew these partisans, these same guys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span> fought together.</sentence><sentence id="129">Where he says to me, "Aren't you going to see your Jews, over there?"</sentence><sentence id="130">He all of a sudden out of nowhere came out, while we were discussing -- I was discussing to myself, what happens Sunday now?</sentence><sentence id="131">Their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was still on over there, it was not destroyed, and what if he asks me -- I go with him on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and work with him together.</sentence><sentence id="132">I associate in the same groups of people.</sentence><sentence id="133">What will it be, how will I feel if I'm asked to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with him together?</sentence><sentence id="134">And I did not know at the moment, so when he start talking about, and using that word, you Jews, instead of using the word, aren't you going go see our friends, the partisans, over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="135">You know what I mean, or maybe naming someone?</sentence><sentence id="136">But he said you Jews.</sentence><sentence id="137">So I felt a separation going on, and I --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="141">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 9 all of a sudden I awakened like from a <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, and says, "Wait a minute now, I cannot hide myself."</sentence><sentence id="142">Oh, I cannot run away, because each sort of day is something that it isn't totally open.</sentence><sentence id="143">And I immediately said to him, "Of course I want to see, but you know how we worked every day long hours, and hard work, how was I to disrupt you and me from that work, and ask you about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="144">But since you don't plan on working perhaps tomorrow," because Saturday -- I did not observe S-Saturday, so anything like that at that time, because under the Soviets, religion was another part of life that you did not practice.</sentence><sentence id="145">So I said to him, "If time permits you, I will be very happy that you give it to me, and I will also ask you to please let me go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Before we go on, let me just footnote here that -- that you told this story in the first interview, and -- and I'm -- I'm glad you're telling it again, because you're giving some more details that are -- that are interesting, and that are helping to -- to clarify what was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: But -- but we should just probably move on from --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: -- from that <span class="REGION">area</span>, rather than going into telling the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="152">I just wonder if you have any more.</sentence><sentence id="153">I know you -- you went -- well, for one thing, I wondered if you -- you told in the first video how you had -- how you had left, and Volodya.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Volodya, yeah.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="161"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: And did you ever see him again after that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: I -- I did since we wound up work -- after all, after the two weeks were up, we were back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span>, he to the militia.</sentence><sentence id="164">We went on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="165">But from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darechen</span>, | did not return back to his <span class="DLF">farmland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">I only told him, I says, when -- we" ll meet at it -- because I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelbo</span>, which is -- was the name, to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">So we said we'll meet approximately the same time.</sentence><sentence id="168">It so happened that we did meet on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and we went with the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span>, while he went to the militia.</sentence><sentence id="169">His cousin didn't go -- di -- wa -- didn't take the job there, so he remained separately.</sentence><sentence id="170">He, as a matter of fact, volunteered coming back to the army, you know?</sentence><sentence id="171">And we met back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span>, but it was not any longer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boronivitch</span> that we met as quickly, or as frequently as we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="172">And another thing I want to point out here, be for what he asked me, pertaining, as a I pointed out to the question, you Jews.</sentence><sentence id="173">I did not want to carry that as a stick, sort of to punish him with that, or asking him why did he say it, because in my mind, I saw the natural thing of it.</sentence><sentence id="174">You know, other words, it's I and you, and he sort of was not ready to hear from me, or to see from me, that hey Volodya, what do you mean you, or this, that and the other, we are just one, and I'm working the same way.</sentence><sentence id="175">So I did not take up any time.</sentence><sentence id="176">So whenever I would meet up with him, we meet -- we would meet again like yesterday's friends, and not any criticism whatsoever, because I took it in my heart a justifiable way, the way he said it.</sentence><sentence id="177">He didn't prepare himself to make a speech.</sentence><sentence id="178">He just said about the way he felt.</sentence><sentence id="179">So</sentence><sentence id="181">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 11 therefore, I never criticized it, or take -- took it [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="182">So yes they would meet.</sentence><sentence id="183">Now, I don't know whether I told you that I got married, after which -- in January, I don't know in the previous tape did I mention about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Yes, you did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: I believe I did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: You did.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: And I wondered if you had ever thought of changing your name back from Zissman after you arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: I -- I was telling -- to tell you the truth, it was a grave mistake at that particular time, because I was so in -- I became to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, already had a child, and it's sort of, what is it, we're going to mix up a whole thing, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="304">So to me it wasn't that far of my name, what -- what good is that going to me?</sentence><sentence id="305">And I remained with that name, however, at any time I tell my story, I -- or I file applications, or so, I still refer to that my birth name was Zucherman, and -- and my regular name was Zissman, the adopted name was Zissman.</sentence><sentence id="306">And it's -- it became a joke to me.</sentence><sentence id="307">Z-Zissman from German means sweet, and Zucherman means from sugar.</sentence><sentence id="308">So in other words I always joke the sugar became sweeter, that's why I used the name Zissman, and that was not too far fetched, you know what I mean, to do it.</sentence><sentence id="309">So I left it the way it is.</sentence><sentence id="310">So, after, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, meeting that Shpark, within a couple of days, I was in touched with a for -- with the former fighters of the partisan, and this ma -- people who already had formed the Zionistic party again, and the option was -- as they -- as it was called, the runners.</sentence><sentence id="311">They were there, tha -- from Hebrew Bricha.</sentence><sentence id="312">Anybody who ran away right now, and looked for an identity of where to go, and the -- the -- this -- the whole thing led us, the goal was to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, one way or the other, because we sort of -- no matter how I looked at it, Europe was an insecure <span class="NPIP">place</span>, because any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, other than <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I found had the</sentence><sentence id="314"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 16 same story, Jews were killed.</sentence><sentence id="315">It was only a matter of the percentages.</sentence><sentence id="316">And unfortunately, out of the six million, three million were killed in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because they corroborated much more than the people in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> did, and -- and that was the results of it.</sentence><sentence id="317">So basically my zeal at that particular time was, end goal, to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and I enlisted myself with the illegal party -- not ill -- it's not the party, it was the part -- the Zionistic party, that they were doing, that helped to help those -- those who ran away, the runaways, sort of, to bring them in this year.</sentence><sentence id="318">And they accepted me, and immediately they made me the head of 10 more guys [indecipherable] and when we came from there, we -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, we were sent to <span

to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">In <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, the Red Cross, which I met for the first time -- otherwise, during the war, I did not even know that the Red Cross existed, or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="321">I knew that -- that it existed, but meaning not to speak derogatorily about it, there was no such thing wherever the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> was, anything to see the sign of a Red Cross, as they should be the -- the -- the people to help the Jews in any kind of way.</sentence><sentence id="322">But, so for the first time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, I have seen a Red Cross, and they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> open for

whatever it is that everybody was returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="323">So the traffic back and forth from cu -- in <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> existed, and the Red Cross, at that particular time, was available to give us a little helping hand.</sentence><sentence id="324">And they made us ID's, and the destination of that particular time,</sentence><sentence id="326">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 17 was to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778"

but <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time, as it -- as it's -- historically the name of the <span class="REGION">area</span> was called <span

me, and I assume in the rest of the guys that are war with me, because when people resorted themselves to go on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- to a -- <span class="DLF">rooftops</span>, and

[ll tell you that, because it was deception in the party.</sentence><sentence id="587">While I was working in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, sending illegals away, and one day I came telling them that my wife became pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="588">When I told them about the news, they say -- and I want to go with my group, illegals, they says, "No, Harold, you stay here on the point,

preparing them for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="591">However, the day came, and the free passage, as we called them, certificates at that particular time

asked my man in charge, "What happened to me, and my wife?"</sentence><sentence id="592">He says, "Well, there wasn't enough this time, but we expect pretty soon to have more."</sentence><sentence id="593">And at that particular time, you know, it was already -- of course, she was not -- she probably must have been -- give or take at that particular time, maybe in her fifth month, you know, because I'm -- I'm not counting at this time the times.</sentence><sentence id="594">I came the second time to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, when the next batch of certificates came, and all of a sudden, people begin to laugh at me.</sentence><sentence id="595">They s-say, "Oh, Harold, you don't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> any more, you trying to go to <span

Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 29 that somebody put me down too low, it was too much.</sentence><sentence id="600">So then I said to my commanding officer, "I'll tell you, I'm resigning my

written in Yiddish, and it never been translated, because he is writing not just about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where we were, he is writing about a lot of other <span

to, but as soon -- the sooner -- it got ignited very easily, they -- somebody did not have to sort of hit me, and to say, "Hey Harold, what are you doing?"</sentence><sentence id="610">I was right

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1082">Q: How did you know her?</sentence><sentence id="1083">How di -- had she -- when did she come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1086">A: She came in 1929, at the same time when we -- we moved over to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> from where I was born.</sentence><sentence id="1087">And we moved -- the name of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Australenka</span>, and I still with my mother, went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to say good-bye to her.</sentence><sentence id="1088">And she was favorite with me when I was a child, up to then.</sentence><sentence id="1089">You know, I was only seven years of age in 1929.</sentence><sentence id="1090">But the point was, to ever she was go out, leave for picnics, whatever it is, I was -- I -- like she took me like -- she loved me -- not at -- like she loved me, she loved me so much that she always was -- the other part about it, from the other nieces and nephew what they had, they were not there, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they were all -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, her brothers were already before that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1091">And so she came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that time.</sentence><sentence id="1092">My mother would keep at that time, sort of a promise that I -- we should be in contact.</sentence><sentence id="1093">So while my mother was</sentence><sentence id="1095"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 45 write, she would go ahead to ask me to write the address to her.</sentence><sentence id="1096">So therefore, in my mind, it just imbued that I remembered -- I could not even pronounce good in English in those years, the address.</sentence><sentence id="1097">But at that address, where she was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> was so memorized by me, and my few words that I used to write so we can keep contact.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So yes, she remembered me as the child when she left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">And when I first got in touch with her, it was the whole story of our lives, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="1100">They had to make papers three times, to bring us in, like I was telling you.</sentence><sentence id="1101">So what was the reason?</sentence><sentence id="1102">At first she thought that I'm still single, because I couldn't write in the letters through that army that I'm telling her that I already am married.</sentence><sentence id="1103">So they made out immediately papers for me to come.</sentence><sentence id="1104">No sooner we got more in touch, they found out that I'm married.</sentence><sentence id="1105">So, at that time they made the second papers.</sentence><sentence id="1106">The third papers they made th -- because our baby -- our daughter was already born, so that was the reason I had to make three times the papers.</sentence><sentence id="1107">So -- some -- some of the data, I mean, was misconstrued, but that is -- that is a minor situation, we are not going to go into that, that was -- so our love re-establish our -- itself, immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1108">However, the other three brothers that they were here, they were much -- they were much -- they were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> probably before I was born.</sentence><sentence id="1109">So I therefore couldn't go ahead to remember them, but the first, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, for instance, we had the -- one of the -- there was originally four, but one of them was already dead.</sentence><sentence id="1110">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> we -- I had two uncles, and my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="1111">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> I had a third brother, he was the oldest, which again, none of them, besides my aunt, remembered me as a child in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1114">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 46 And after all they -- I started working later for my uncle, and that was my mother's brother, he was in the <span class="BUILDING">grocery business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1115">And, as I forementioned with going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, that was the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> I was working for, for him.</sentence><sentence id="1116">So I know how much further in the story that I told, I do -- over there.</sentence><sentence id="1117">I joined again immediately an organization, we called them the new citizens.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, we dwe -- used to have meetings, and like I aforementioned, and make money f-for existence, and above all, to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, be that it was already -- when the bonds came in existence to be -- the bond drives.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Be otherwise -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> to send to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, or any of these -- it was basically -- all what we did was raising money, and funds through all means, be that it was a dance, be that it was a dinner, be it was membership, but it all was -- the idea about it <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And all of us were a bunch together, but again, the story prevailed with me, there were not that many fighters, there was all concentration inmates.</sentence><sentence id="1121">And we did not have any misunderstanding because and how and what.</sentence><sentence id="1122">And sooner or later we found out, you know what I mean, the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="1123">I remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>'s sen -- fifth anniversary came, and we had a guy from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> coming to speak to us, and I was on the committee, I always belonged someplace, and I always didn't just remain not to belong, or be on the committee or whatever it is, because I cared for it so much.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So that man was a former army colonel, I believe, or so, and he was in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> attached.</sentence><sentence id="1125">So he comes in, and he says to me, he says, "Explain me a little bit about your group."</sentence><sentence id="1126">Because he was going to have the speech, and he wanted -- he didn't have the time before to ask the questions.</sentence><sentence id="1127">So I tried to</sentence><sentence id="1129">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 47 tell him we were 95 percent of former survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, or resistance like Iam.</sentence><sentence id="1130">A few that were -- not even five people that are -- were f -- in the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1131">Hiding maybe, yes, but not in the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1132">So -- and I tried to tell him it's a make-up of various participation.</sentence><sentence id="1133">He says, "Why don't we belong to a party," you see, in other words, the party image or curse, maybe I should say, because it's a curse.</sentence><sentence id="1134">If we wouldn't be so divided, we would have been a stronger nation through the years.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Why don't you belong to one <span class="NPIP">party</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1136">I says, "What would that help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> better?</sentence><sentence id="1137">We raise money, we do all we can to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And that party, I wish you'd stop being so party minded in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, I believe it'd be an easier life."</sentence><sentence id="1139">In contrary, he didn't like my comments, of course, because he said, ""Why do you want to be orphans?"</sentence><sentence id="1140">In other words, belonging to a party meant not being an orphan in his mind, and in his view.</sentence><sentence id="1141">And he came speaking to us, which he was not aware enough what had went on during the Holocaust, because my critic to the time and the era was as -- in my writings, I -- | must mention it to you, there isn't a year that I don't write to the newspaper, at least in a folder about an inch thick, and I have all of them of -- of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And I'm a critic of some of these here things.</sentence><sentence id="1143">I will always try to defend Israeli

more for than I was before ba -- myself, even if I'm not in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1144">But I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a number of occasions.</sentence><sentence id="1145">I received a medal like holmor of the partisans who were there, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1983, then we had a</sentence><sentence id="1147"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 48 gathering of all the fighters.</sentence><sentence id="1148">And I have over here at har -- at <span

is.</sentence><sentence id="1151">I will always belong somewheres, and I will always speak my mind whenever I can, and whenever I've reached out.</sentence><sentence id="1152">So like I say, it was born at that particular time, even when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and we formed the organization.</sentence><sentence id="1153">I was in the starter, but it already was in existence.</sentence><sentence id="1154">We called it the New Citizen's Club, as I aforementioned.</sentence><sentence id="1155">We used to have once a month a meeting, and so on and so

could have bi -- when I saw that, I -- I turned colors, I c -- I was -- I was -- asked that I want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span>, just to go away from the man, if not to lose myself.</sentence><sentence id="1604">So when I -- like we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a year and a half ago, and we [indecipherable] over there, in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, they were maybe 40 percent of Germans, young, of the ages of my kids, and with their children, I did not feel restricted of myself to speak German to these people.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And -- but all in all, I -- I meet people because I am so involved with it, so to one I can speak Polish, while in -- two seconds later, I'1l switch over to Russian, or from Russian to Spanish, or to Hebrew, and people always have -- how could I remember all of that at one time?</sentence><sentence id="1606">And this is -- was my own idea, I don't know how good my memory will serve as I age, you know what I'm saying?</sentence><sentence id="1607">So, it was always importance to me to bring out in me.</sentence><sentence id="1608">I believe someday some student will probably want to make this here a lesson, and to talk about to other children, which is of importance.</sentence><sentence id="1609">And I hope that they always get -- that they always can remember when you have a bad times, don't look for the half empty glass, look for the half full glass.</sentence><sentence id="1610">Hope should never be lost.</sentence><sentence id="1611">We" ll die</sentence><sentence id="1613"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 63 anyways, we all know that.</sentence><sentence id="1614">We cannot preserve that.</sentence><sentence id="1615">But hoping to die, you will die sooner.</sentence><sentence id="1616">Hoping to live, you will live longer.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And it's not just a phraseology of words, it's a thing that it's -- really works.</sentence><sentence id="1618">And you talk to prisoners of war -- we did -- we talked to a man like Mr. McCain, who was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> with the Vietnamese, or you talk anybody who was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and they survived.</sentence><sentence id="1619">They will tell you in the same words that I am saying, they couldn't overcome their ordeal, be in <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span>, be in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span>, be in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>, be ever -- anyplace that a prisoner of war was taken, if hope would not be lost.</sentence><sentence id="1620">Because when hope is lost, that's what it happens, it's lost, life is lost.</sentence><sentence id="1621">So, my message is always of importance.</sentence><sentence id="1622">When I talk about the better deal, not to forget to have that listener hear that hope to live.</sentence><sentence id="1623">So when I speak to young kids, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids and student -- or students, or even in <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> which I spoke, I always do not give answer.</sentence><sentence id="1624">The hardest thing was for me when I spoke to kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of years back -- which I have some on tape also, and they ask me how many Germans did I kill?</sentence><sentence id="1625">And how do you go ahead to answer a child in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when he ask me a raw question like that?</sentence><sentence id="1626">And it's a hard way to answer.</sentence><sentence id="1627">I must therefore, instead of giving him an answer to say, "Oh, I killed probably 20, or 30, or 50," which it would mean I would go ahead to look at a personal thing, remember the questioner, remember that he is the child of 14 and 15, and I do not want to give him that answer, that life -- answer is the weapon, and killing is the answer.</sentence><sentence id="1628">So I always must bring it to him the idea, that yes, killing is not right, but defending oneself is the right that he must never forget, no matter who it is, when your life is threatened, you</sentence><sentence id="1630"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0062 64 also have the law of rights for you to go ahead and defend your life.</sentence><sentence id="1631">So when I tell that to the kids, they get a bi -- they get a different understanding about weapons, and about killing.</sentence><sentence id="1632">And this is usually, when I spoke to kids today, it would not matter where.</sentence><sentence id="1633">I spoke seven years in a row that I used to be here in <span

the first mayor that time, that adopted for me to do it was Mayor Kaminski.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And the biggest question always used to be, why did I want to chose that I want to speak in

sufferings, it started in <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> like that.</sentence><sentence id="1638">Whether laws were changed, or the laws were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1639">I want to be proud of the idea that I survived, and we have seen a time where we can come back to these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, and salute the freedom we have in <span

what it was, my message in the same way when I came to speak in front of the justice depart -- justices in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span>, <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>, when the Nazis wanted to march, so if you're ever interested, go ahead, get the movie, "Skokie," and you'll see Danny Kaye play Harold Zissman in it.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And this is what I said,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1921">Q: -- and what that meant to you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1923">A: When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1948, I believe the first thing on my mind was in the positive, how do I become a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1924">I filed my first papers, as we call them, as soon time permitted to be done for it, and -- and at -- when I was called was almost five years later to become a citizen, and I proudly am happy that I was granted the -- first of all, that I was granted life again, because I consider that's -- I was rebor -- reborn, I, my wife, and my daughter, coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1925">We -- some people of ours, the survivors want to come, that we were reborn, at freedom time when -- when the hostilities ended.</sentence><sentence id="1926">But to me, I don't want to call it that it was still life.</sentence><sentence id="1927">To me, the impression that I made, the first class, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that I thub -- the same thing, even though our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, and we were there with a child, and a few months later, my brother-in-law came.</sentence><sentence id="1928">So even though there was a lot of</sentence><sentence id="1930">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 71 things to be dissatisfied about, but my satisfaction, like I forementioned, be going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, be all of the other things, belonging again to an organization.</sentence><sentence id="1931">So I can see that my life had started -- I was reborn in 1948 with my

id="1933">I know being a history student, and being involved with the things in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, I knew n -- quite well about a person from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1982">Q: Will you list the languages that you speak?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1984">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1985">First of all, I must say, as I said it in the aforementioned tape, I graduated in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by the name Yavna, which is a <span class="BUILDING">Zionist Hebrew school</span>, and it's a trilingual school.</sentence><sentence id="1986">We were taught over there Yiddish, Hebrew, and English.</sentence><sentence id="1987">So immediately, I started with three <span

speak eight la-languages, I say invention -- I say, if a person's in trouble, he says, he must invent something.</sentence><sentence id="1991">So, the American proverb goes with it, and that's what it was invention, for me.</sentence><sentence id="1992">With three languages, when we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>, I had to learn Russian.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Afterwards, after the war, when we came into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, I did not know Italian, so I learned Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1994">While being under the German yoke, it was not a question learning German because I loved that language, it was a question that when a German spoke to you, and you didn't understand what he was saying, the beating was worse.</sentence><sentence id="1995">However, even if you did do what he wanted, you still got a beating.</sentence><sentence id="1996">But you had to -- so again, it was necessity, was for me to learn another language.</sentence><sentence id="1997">So no matter how much I learned German, but I could at least speak, and converse with someone in German.</sentence><sentence id="1998">So we have three, and two is five, and the sixth one, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1999">You come to a <span

them.</sentence><sentence id="2000">They didn't care to say Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2001">To them it was polacko.</sentence><sentence id="2002">Seeing as I was coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I'm Polish.</sentence><sentence id="2003">And when you said to them the word Jew, or Hebraio, they did not even know what the meaning of it, especially in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like that, where Mussolini, and fa -- fash -- if -- if you call Fascism Fascism, started it way before Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="2004">But the people were not drilled on the hatred.</sentence><sentence id="2005">If anybody hated a Jew, perhaps he hated somebody else, too, because he was a hater.</sentence><sentence id="2006">But I didn't feel it.</sentence><sentence id="2007">The hospitality of these people, what they had to us, is beyond reproach.</sentence><sentence id="2008">You ask an Italian person, you show him with an address here

class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2011">He'd take you there.</sentence><sentence id="2012">This, to us, at that particular time, case is need, but I still tried to learn

didn't vote, even -- even if it wasn't a regular election, but it was just a matter of a party election, which it was, I always voted, because I feel, after what I've been through, where voting was denied for me, where citizenryship was denied from me, that this is a privilege thing that one could never give up, and I never did, and I never failed to vote.</sentence><sentence id="2420">And like I said,</sentence><sentence id="2422">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 88 President Truman left a big -- that buck stops here, he left a lot of good things on me, and through the era, every once in

that rupture since then.</sentence><sentence id="2429">But if he would have invoke at that time, our military might, which we had and we could, because when a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> invades an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of the next <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, that's a declaration of war, even if it's not officially said, the word, but that international law

I believe the loss -- the horn of <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> at that time, and inflation that had gone up to 27 and half percent, sure the retired people loved him for that, because they

that it did occur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> later, that we were denied our law, and they came out to speak, but we started the same thing, as I said, we were throwing rocks, and eggs, and whatever you wanted, and the only thing it lasted for about three -- two minutes, or four, and they were -- had to be run out.</sentence><sentence id="2912">The fact remains that later on we

that's a good lesson to prove what Freedom of Speech means.</sentence><sentence id="2925">I agree with it, but I don't agree at the cost of another part of the public, to be denied the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3350">A: I can conceive in a good, open mind, that what had happened to me with the riots, I did not pluralize ever to say Black people, this, that and the

would say there were two butchers, which they were white, and the other butchers, two of them were Black.</sentence><sentence id="3356">The rest of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, all my

myself that I was not the party that had to get hurt, but maybe to say I was in the wrong <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, and therefore I got hurt because of

all.</sentence><sentence id="3376">I became a -- an outdoor salesman, I couldn't re-establish myself back in the <span class="BUILDING">retail business</span>, because my fortune didn't go along with

it happened.</sentence><sentence id="3378">Yes, I can ask questions, why did it happen to me?</sentence><sentence id="3379">Maybe to say I didn't deserve to happen to me.</sentence><sentence

time, and in that movie, it showed a case, where typically, what the -- the inmate of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> becames pregnant -- do you know that movie, what it was,

her, and later when he discovers her -- so when he discovers where she is, he makes so many attempts, and somehow or other, she does not want to s -- recognize herself.</sentence><sentence

there, she greets him, and then he takes a look at the child, and he sees the child s-so much close -- in close look at him, he looks like the commander of that <span

to tell him why she h -- was in hiding of that whole case, because how she -- she's still in love with him,</sentence><sentence id="3792">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 140 and that did not happen

conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="3798">I wrote to Simon Wiesenthal about it, I mean, in -- in the -- in the -- <span class="REGION">California</span>, and they told me, if you want to, you can write to Simon Wiesenthal your protest, which they gave me the address to write to him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="3799">That was one of my things that I was against it of the ending of that movie.</sentence><sentence id="3800">In other words, you ended the movie with sort of, what do you think?</sentence><sentence id="3801">What do you think it was?</sentence><sentence id="3802">Was she justified not to go to answer, or wasn't she not justified?</sentence><sentence id="3803">And itll always be a question about

you in short, is what it deals.</sentence><sentence id="3811">Like I say, everybody has their opinion, but my opinion was when you put the name of Simon Wiesenthal on there, and he was -- I was -- I'm very happy with the man who discovered so many murderers, that they would have been dome in the cases like this here.</sentence><sentence id="3812">But no one is perfect, I suppose, in this world, and that was a goofball by Simon Wiesenthal, not that he planned it to work out that way.</sentence><sentence id="3813">And it was a thing, it was done, it was over.</sentence><sentence id="3814">I watched that movie twice that night.</sentence><sentence id="3815">I called <span class="REGION">California</span> because it was three hours, so the guard, looks like, was the

responding.</sentence><sentence id="3817">Well, it's Simon Wiesenthal is responsible, he was the one producing that.</sentence><sentence id="3818">So, what you talk to us over here [indecipherable] or the others, we had nothing to do with the producing it.</sentence><sentence id="3819">I merely for the case, so that -- wanted to tell you about it, because for always, and forever, I will remain involved in the cause, or in the fight of justice, because this is, again, it was an unjust case.</sentence><sentence id="3820">It -- let's surmise and to say, because she didn't come to be the witness, maybe he didn't get the proper punishment, or was punished at all.</sentence><sentence id="3821">Now, I don't believe that a murderer should be brought -- so somebody who constru -- who made that movie should have made that part be a -- sure, all of this, but it should have ended in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="3822">It could have perhaps ended that her testimony was not in a person to person kind of way, but it was in a -- taking a deposition, and therefore he</sentence><sentence id="3824">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0062 142 was -- [indecipherable] so much in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="3825">At least it would have had a decent ending to what it is.</sentence><sentence id="3826">Do you follow me what I am saying?</sentence><sentence id="3827">But like this here, because it produced a child, and for her to expose it to this child, sooner or later, someday, he will know about it.</sentence><sentence id="3828">Be that she will tell him, or others will tell him.</sentence><sentence id="3829">Max had the -- meanwhile, had to leave that sort of -- he was in love with her, she was in love with
