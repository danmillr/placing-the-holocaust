<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3841">Q: I was going to ask you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3843">A: But I think I experienced that more when I was selected for work.</sentence><sentence id="3844">Well, before I was selected for work, we had this horrendous experience with the Hungarians girls.</sentence><sentence id="3845">They were fairly young girls, and there was as -- some of these people who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for any length of</sentence><sentence id="3847">7 time, they didn't look like human beings any more.</sentence><sentence id="3848">They're called the musselmen, a -- I don't know where the heck that came from, but they were really walking skeletons.</sentence><sentence id="3849">And their skin, and the expressions on their faces, and their eyes, th -- cannot be described.</sentence><sentence id="3850">And next to our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that housed Hungarian women.</sentence><sentence id="3851">A lot of young women, who had been there a relatively long time for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, you know, a number of months, and they have been through I think what -- two selections before, so there were no older people left in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, they were all younger pl -- people.</sentence><sentence id="3852">But they were coming closer di -- to the description of these musselmen.</sentence><sentence id="3853">They were in terrible shape.</sentence><sentence id="3854">And they had a selektion, and of course, I did -- never heard of a selektion, we had only been in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for a relatively short time, and they were shooting, and we thought this is it, they're going to just shoot everybody around.</sentence><sentence id="3855">And then one of the girls managed to get into our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3856">And apparently another girl was killed, was shot by the SS, but our elder, our block elder knew this girl, and they had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a long time, and apparently she has -- had escaped selektions a number of times.</sentence><sentence id="3857">And here we were fairly new, and all this was -- we were being told all these horrors that I couldn't digest.</sentence><sentence id="3858">And here, I will never forget this girl, she's standing there at the end of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and the block elder, who seemed like a pretty brutal woman herself, was shielding her.</sentence><sentence id="3859">And she told us that she'd been there for such and such a time, she'd been selected a few times, and that people were being selected after they were not physically strong any more, and they were being gassed.</sentence><sentence id="3860">And she gave such a vivid description and she told us about how many of her friends had been -- had been gassed, that it finally dawned on me, ma -- maybe this is true.</sentence><sentence id="3861">Maybe this is so.</sentence><sentence id="3862">It wasn't just when you come there that they select you like Mengele, but they select you afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="3863">Now that was -- that wa -- made a terrible impression on me.</sentence><sentence id="3864">And then shortly after that, we had a selektion for work.</sentence><sentence id="3865">And it was a fairly large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and it was pretty cold, and we had to</sentence><sentence id="3867">8 all strip naked again, and walk in front of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3868">And there was a man, a representative from industry at one end, and two SS officers at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3869">And he selected very few people.</sentence><sentence id="3870">And we were kind of standing in <span class="DLF">line</span>, naked.</sentence><sentence id="3871">And when I got to this man from industry, he asked me to show him my hands, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="3872">I -- I don't have a very small, fancy hand.</sentence><sentence id="3873">And then h-he motioned obviously that he was going to take me for work at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> he represented.</sentence><sentence id="3874">And the people selected for work, as I said before, were a relatively small number.</sentence><sentence id="3875">And we were then pushed into the <span class="DLF">road</span> again, and you know, we had -- we could put a -- we only had a dress anyway, put our dress on, was pushed into the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3876">And we were put into a s -- we were in front of another <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span>, and by that time, I believe that people were being gassed, because we could smell the burning flesh, really.</sentence><sentence id="3877">And when the SS guard told us that we had to strip naked before we even got into the <span class="BUILDING">shower house</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span>, I really thought that was it, because I also had learned that people were gassed in a <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span>, that the gas came through the shower heads.</sentence><sentence id="3878">So it was welcome when we felt the ice cold water dripping on our skin.</sentence><sentence id="3879">And we again just got a shift, and no underwear, no socks.</sentence><sentence id="3880">And we were pushed into the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span>, which had mostly non-Jews in it.</sentence><sentence id="3881">I believe they were all Polish, at least the ones I saw.</sentence><sentence id="3882">The elder was a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="3883">And they had different insignias, which I learned there designated whether they were political prisoners or murderers.</sentence><sentence id="3884">And I understood from people there that the block elder was a murderer, that this particular triangle or whatever she wore, represented the identification of a murderess.</sentence><sentence id="3885">And she was very brutal, and horrible, and she beat people very readily.</sentence><sentence id="3886">And she s -- put -- she gave us different chores to do, and one of the chores that she dished out for me, was to carry the feces to the latrines during the night, with another woman, and accompanied by a Nazi guard.</sentence><sentence id="3887">You know, the women were not SS, they were Nazi guards in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="3888">And I shall never forget that night.</sentence><sentence id="3889">It was a very dark night, and there was a horrible</sentence><sentence id="3891">9 smell, and the whole <span class="DLF">sky</span> was bright red.</sentence><sentence id="3892">And these very tall <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> were spewing particles into the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3893">And the woman who carried the buckets with me, who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> a lot longer than I had, she said, "Another transport must have arrived.</sentence><sentence id="3894">These are our people going through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3895">You know, a normal person would have collapsed right there and there, and I don't think things really penetrated.</sentence><sentence id="3896">We had much better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedding</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plank beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3897">They were the same size, but instead of, you know, eight people, or whatever, or seven or whatever we were on one, there were three of us.</sentence><sentence id="3898">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zdena</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buschi</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3899">And we became friends for life.</sentence><sentence id="3900">And one day we were told to get ready for work and we were marched to the railroad trestle, and we were put into a transport.</sentence><sentence id="3901">And I cannot recall how long we were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, but then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> stopped eventually -- because we were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, and there was really no way -- you know, some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were older, and they were - - you -- you had an idea, looking through some of the little <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span>, but there weren't too many <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> to be found.</sentence><sentence id="3902">And we ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kudowa-Sackisch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3903">In other words, we had been going west, not east.</sentence><sentence id="3904">This was an <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span>, and the man who had selected me worked -- was a representative of that <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3905">And I never forget that night.</sentence><sentence id="3906">We were so happy.</sentence><sentence id="3907">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> were better, the blankets were wonderful, the food was better.</sentence><sentence id="3908">And, for the first time, we had <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, a hot <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, and we got a piece of soap.</sentence><sentence id="3909">And then the next morning we had to form a circle in the <span class="DLF">factory yard</span>, and the German foreman stepped into the middle of that circle, and he looked around, and he decided he didn't like anybody to work for him in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> who wore eyeglasses.</sentence><sentence id="3910">I wore glasses and Zdena wore glasses, Buschi did not.</sentence><sentence id="3911">And he -- we stepped forward.</sentence><sentence id="3912">At first I didn't want to step forward.</sentence><sentence id="3913">And Buschi said to me, "Haven't we played enough fate?"</sentence><sentence id="3914">You know, and she was referring to my volunteering to go with my father, and my father and my brother going with me, and I put my glasses back on.</sentence><sentence id="3915">And of course he</sentence><sentence id="3917">00 selected me to step forward, and Zdena step forward.</sentence><sentence id="3918">And then for some reason, he told Buschi to step forward.</sentence><sentence id="3919">And you know, either Zdena or I said to her, "But you don't wear glasses."</sentence><sentence id="3920">So, I never forget Buschi's words.</sentence><sentence id="3921">She said, "That's fate.</sentence><sentence id="3922">It's supposed to be that way." "</sentence><sentence id="3923">Das ist das <span class="BUILDING">Schicksal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3924">Es soll so sein."</sentence><sentence id="3925">And there were six of us, and he called us garbage, rejects, who were not going to work in his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and we were going to be sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3926">And we were rounded up by a woman, a Nazi guard, but she was different from any of the guards that we had encountered.</sentence><sentence id="3927">She didn't scream at us, she was kind of nice, she ki -- she somehow behaved as if she didn't belong there.</sentence><sentence id="3928">Now, I don't know what her history was, whether she wad -- was drafted into that, who knows?</sentence><sentence id="3929">But she -- she took us to the <span class="DLF">railroad trestle</span>, and then I did something I felt terrible about for a long, long time.</sentence><sentence id="3930">And Buschi and Hannah and Zdena were very upset with me, because they felt very strongly that I had saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="3931">It wasn't just -- there was one other woman.</sentence><sentence id="3932">There were two other women who felt the same way, but we kind of lost contact after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="3933">And I pleaded with this guard, and I told you she seemed more accessible, because I would have never dreamt to do this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with any guard.</sentence><sentence id="3934">And I pleaded for my life, and I told her that I shouldn't be there.</sentence><sentence id="3935">I was really not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3936">My mother was a Christian and I -- I shouldn't be here.</sentence><sentence id="3937">And she answered in a way like somebody would who really felt badly about it.</sentence><sentence id="3938">And she said, "But there's nothing I can do about it." "</sentence><sentence id="3939">Kann nicht sta fur mat -- kann nicht daran tun."</sentence><sentence id="3940">And then she left us, asked us to -- first she asked us to stay together, there were six, we didn't know the others.</sentence><sentence id="3941">And she was flirting with two German soldiers who were accompanying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3942">In the meantime we realized that there was one other German woman, she had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3943">We never got too close with her, she was much older than most of us.</sentence><sentence id="3944">And there was another Czech woman, Hanka, she was a communist, through and through.</sentence><sentence id="3945">And I can say that I never felt a relationship with Hanka.</sentence><sentence id="3946">I mean, we all helped each other, but it wasn't</sentence><sentence id="3948">01 the same relationship I felt with Buschi and Hannah and Zdena.</sentence><sentence id="3949">And there was one woman, Hannah, and we three became very close friends.</sentence><sentence id="3950">And then one of the soldiers came to us.</sentence><sentence id="3951">In the meantime -- I must say this first, there were hundreds of inmates on the railroad trestle.</sentence><sentence id="3952">They were Hungarian workers who had worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and who -- they had worked these women practically to death.</sentence><sentence id="3953">They could hardly stand, they had open sores, impetigo, whatever it was, they were in horrible shape.</sentence><sentence id="3954">And they had been pushed by the SS into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> were full to the brim, and then they locked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3955">And our guard had stayed with us in the meantime, and then had gone over to the soldiers, and the SS had left.</sentence><sentence id="3956">Because I think that we were the responsibility of that Nazi guard.</sentence><sentence id="3957">And then one of the soldiers came over and told us to follow him and he put us into the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3958">And we were the only six in this huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>, and then he locked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3959">And I have no idea any more, and I'm not sure even would have had an idea when we came -- when we finally ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.8412306" long="16.033644">Merzdorf</span>, how long we had been in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3960">But the soldiers finally opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and joined us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3961">One was relatively young, and you know, the -- Hannah thinks this guy was this old, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="3962">And the younger of the soldiers cried, and he told his buddy that if his people did that to human beings, he didn't want to live any more.</sentence><sentence id="3963">And they gave us bread, they gave us cheese, they gave us privacy.</sentence><sentence id="3964">I mean, we hadn't seen white bread for years, and cheese.</sentence><sentence id="3965">And they gave us privacy to use a bucket.</sentence><sentence id="3966">And we sat in this huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> in one corner, and deciding what are we going to do when we return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3967">And the only language that Hannah, Zdena, and the -- and the other Czech girl, and I and the -- the -- the German girl we didn't have too much close relationship with, spoke, was German, because they were all educated people, and this -- most of the Czechs spoke German, and of course the Dutch do.</sentence><sentence id="3968">And Buschi's family originally came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> anyway, so I don't remember whether she had some German grandparents</sentence><sentence id="3970">02 or what.</sentence><sentence id="3971">And Buschi and I decided that we were going to throw each -- ourselves against the electric wire instead of being gassed.</sentence><sentence id="3972">And the German soldiers heard that, you know, we spoke their language.</sentence><sentence id="3973">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a standstill.</sentence><sentence id="3974">| have no idea what they did while we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> that we had been in before.</sentence><sentence id="3975">They must have spoken to the engineer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3976">They must have coordinated it somehow.</sentence><sentence id="3977">But on the other hand, you have to realize that this was the very beginning of 1945, and things weren't looking too great for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3978">So they told us to jump out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> and follow them.</sentence><sentence id="3979">And when we got onto the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, we realized it said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.8412306" long="16.033644">Merzdorf</span>, it did not say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3980">And we followed them through the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span
