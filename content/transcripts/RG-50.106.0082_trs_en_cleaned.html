<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> is -- is not that far from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">So what about the journey there, do you remember anything about that?</sentence><sentence id="246">And then where did you first settle?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Well, we settled for a while in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">And after that when -- apparently my parents did not get permission to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span>, or they -- or thought it appropriate otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="252">I must admit I never did find, never did ask.</sentence><sentence id="253">We moved across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span>, which is in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and lived there.</sentence><sentence id="254">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span>, both my sister and I did, in a <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> there.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: What was that like for you?</sentence><sentence id="260">Did you have any idea of the language in the beginning?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: None whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="262">Well, you know you, a-at that age if you get thrown into this sort of environment -- the people there obviously do speak German or a Swiss dialect, or a Swiss type of dialect, or whatever you want to call the Alsace -- the Alsatian manner of speaking.</sentence><sentence id="263">And so -- but French obviously was -- was -- was difficult, and we had a-- we spent a limited amount of time in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: How long were you in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: To the best of my recollection, un -- until late -- sometime middle, late 1934.</sentence><sentence id="270">In other words, about -- I would say about a year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Any -- any unpleasant experiences there where you would -- did they know you were Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: No unpleasant experiences to the extent that I know now -- that I can recall, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: And were you very close to your parents, did you have a very good relationship with them, or were they open with you about what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Well--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Or did you not question?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: A, I probably didn't question it too much.</sentence><sentence id="282">B, I guess at that time already, my parents were under a great deal of strain, certainly a lot more than I was.</sentence><sentence id="283">And while</sentence><sentence id="285">one develops a certain type of closeness as a result, it's -- it's not quite the same as a --as a closeness which develops in -- in tranc -- peace and tranquility.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: Were you able to voice your fears to your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: I don't recall that I had any fears.</sentence><sentence id="295">I suspect that my parents probably were anxious to -- limited my fears to the maximum possible, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Did you talk things over with your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: No, we were a little bit -- we were apart -- five years apart.</sentence><sentence id="298">I would say that communication is prob -- was probably more -- even more difficult tha-than with my parents, because the -- the -- the five year age difference between the youngsters is -- is pretty substantial.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: So, after the year was over, then where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, in 1934, I believe it was, the French, having received a large number of refugees -- at this point we had largely given up our business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and still had the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">At that point I believe it was that the French authorities basically said to the refugees in -- many had settled along the <span class="DLF">border</span> here, that it was necessary for them to go inland a certain distance, or to leave.</sentence><sentence id="305">In other words, <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> along the <span class="DLF">border</span> was not -- was frowned upon, or in fact, forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="306">And so my parents really had a choice to make; do they want to go inland?</sentence><sentence id="307">And is -- if I remember correctly, I think the closest they could go to would be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merceuil</span> or, do they want to leave -- and,</sentence><sentence id="309">which would of course made pretty well impossible the business -- maintaining the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and while he -- to a certain extent, the business in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, which was also very close to the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: So your father was still actively working at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Oh yes, we -- we still had our business.</sentence><sentence id="321">And so we packed up and moved back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">And we did not move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, we moved to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loerrach</span>, I-o-e -- double r-a-c-h.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Is that near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: That is -- well, everything is n-- well, a-again, it's one of those things that today it's very close, in the old days it was quite far.</sentence><sentence id="329">It's only about two miles from the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">It was about three miles as the crow flies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Louis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">In other words, they were all [indecipherable] or not, at the point where the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> makes its bend, where the free countries meet.</sentence><sentence id="332">It was about, oh I would say, 40 - 50 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">So we -- we got back there fairly frequently, but it -- it still -- in those days it was a fairly long distance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Was it hard going over the <span class="DLF">borders</span> at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: No, it was quite easy.</sentence><sentence id="343">A-Again, for a time we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">guesthouse</span>, a -- a <span class="BUILDING">local hotel</span> near the swi -- again, very close to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">I would say -- as I say, about the mile.</sentence><sentence id="345">And then eventually moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">And that must have been either 1934 or early 1935.</sentence><sentence id="349">By that time my sister did not come back, or came back and then she was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, a -- what is it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: <span class="BUILDING">Boarding school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2935">Q: Did you learn a tremendous amount by doing this research?</sentence><sentence id="2936">Did you come to conclusions you didn't think you'd be coming to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2939">A: Yes, very definitely did.</sentence><sentence id="2940">The biggest conclusion -- first of all yes, you obvi -- I obviously did a great deal of research into the era, into the life of the Polish Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2941">I mean, here's -- here are -- here are people that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1911.</sentence><sentence id="2942">In 1938 they're shoved across the <span class="DLF">border</span> as Poles.</sentence><sentence id="2943">You learn about why they were pushed across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and here you can attribute that to the actions of the Polish government as much as to the German government.</sentence><sentence id="2944">It's a story that's not too well known, but the fact of the matter is, it was -- it was provoked by the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="2945">But the biggest thing that I think I learned is that to me Herschel Grynszpan to start with, was an assassin.</sentence><sentence id="2946">I don't like assassins, for any reason, regardless.</sentence><sentence id="2947">And I was not</sentence><sentence id="2949">terribly favorably well disposed towards him.</sentence><sentence id="2950">I learned two things.</sentence><sentence id="2951">One, before his probable death -- in other words, we still don't know exactly where he died, although we have a pretty good idea -- this young man, from becoming a young, hot-headed assassin, became a true hero.</sentence><sentence id="2952">Secondly, whatever damage he did an -- to Jews, which resulted in Crystal Night, I think he saved many more lives, or his act saved many more lives than the -- the -- the death that he caused; for the very simple reason that immigration of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> started high in 1933, went down through 1937, early "38, and then immediately after Crystal Night, immigration shot up.</sentence><sentence id="2953">So a lot more people left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a result.</sentence><sentence id="2954">So in the end, he really -- his act really saved lives, even though 110 - 115 people died in the immediate aftermath of Crystal Night.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2956">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Gerald Schwab.</sentence><sentence id="2957">This is tape number three, side B.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3012">A: Oh yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="3013">He was, as far as I'm concerned, he cracked the case in -- as to what the -- the subsequent argument or this -- the -- what the -- the argument that Grynszpan used to avoid a trial.</sentence><sentence id="3014">Basically, what happened, Herschel Grynszpan avoided trial, or when the Germans were all ready there to put Herschel Grynszpan on the world stage, on trial -- for this they had already invited, or were ready to invite the main newspaper people from around th-the -- the neutral Europe.</sentence><sentence id="3015">They -- it was a big to-do -- was to be a big propaganda trial.</sentence><sentence id="3016">They had built a special <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> [indecipherable] new <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3017">It was to be a big to-do.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And Herschel Grynszpan finally announced t -- before -- shortly before the trial was to take place, that he had killed vom Rath because vom Rath had made homosexual advances to him.</sentence><sentence id="3019">Now, obviously homosexuality is not what major propaganda trials are made of, especially if the victim was supposedly involved.</sentence><sentence id="3020">Well, when I finally did speak to hersh -- to Moro-Giafferi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, he -- by the way, he was a -- a man about five foot</sentence><sentence id="3022">tall and five foot wide, who when I saw him the first time, greeted me with the statement that he had ever -- only ever lost one man to the guillotine, and that was Bluebeard, and -- which I said could be forgiven.</sentence><sentence id="3023">And he was the number one criminal lawyer in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in -- in the 20" century; certainly the first half of the fu -- 20" century, who had really been the lawyer for just about every -- every major criminal trial, especially murder trials.</sentence><sentence id="3024">Well, Moro-Giafferi smiled, laughed, and he says, well, let me explain where he got that idea.</sentence><sentence id="3025">He says, when I initially took up his defense -- and he had been hired, as I said, by Dorothy Thompson, who at that point was a major figure in American journalism, foreign correspondent in the days when foreign correspondents were still major figures, in -- in the days when you didn't have instantaneous CNN coverage and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3026">He said, I told -- I asked Herschel why he had killed vom Rath, and he said, because had gotten this postcard, and what happened to his parents.</sentence><sentence id="3027">And I explained that this matter -- Moro-Giafferi speaking -- explained to him that French juries are not terribly friendly disposed towards political crimes.</sentence><sentence id="3028">However, in a case of crimes of passion, French juries are much more lenient.</sentence><sentence id="3029">And since there had been rumors, which I have certainly not been able to confirm, that vom Rath had homosexual tendencies, and had been rumors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that he had visited homosexual places, he suggested that he may want to argue that there was a homosexual connection between the two.</sentence><sentence id="3030">Well, according to Moro- Giafferi, Grynszpan rejected this out of hand.</sentence><sentence id="3031">But then a few years later</sentence><sentence id="3033">100 November 18, 1997 remembered it, used it, and basically said to his cellmate, they're not going to make me -- make another show trial out of me, they've done enough damage already.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3059">A: Well, I just wanted to put it on paper, and put it in history.</sentence><sentence id="3060">I don't think it's that terribly important, because if that hadn't happened, something else would have triggered what happened subsequently, where there would have been a Kristallnacht, it probably would have happened differently.</sentence><sentence id="3061">But I certainly don't think that Herschel Grynszpan caused it; he was the excuse.</sentence><sentence id="3062">And so I don't consider this book as you know, that terribly important.</sentence><sentence id="3063">It's -- to me it's an interesting footnote to history.</sentence><sentence id="3064">I don't over -- don't want to overdramatize the importance of it.</sentence><sentence id="3065">It's -- it's an interesting -- it's a fascinating life, it's an interesting individual, certainly the way he turned out to be.</sentence><sentence id="3066">And as far he -- he -- I have the utmost respect for him, and I felt his story needed to be told.</sentence></p></dialogue>
