save us.</sentence><sentence id="1396">Always my mommy I called.</sentence><sentence id="1397">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1398">I never called and this time, it was times that I didn't believe in God.</sentence><sentence id="1399">It was times that I was thinking it is impossible that it can be a God and can see this everything what happened to us and not to do something about.</sentence><sentence id="1400">And the Germans had on the buckles, they had written.</sentence><sentence id="1401">This means, "God is with them."</sentence><sentence id="1402">You know!</sentence><sentence id="1403">So I was thinking maybe they are right.</sentence><sentence id="1404">God is with them, not with us.</sentence><sentence id="1405">And...and...uh... so... so I was..the...I was thinking...sometimes I was not believing.</sentence><sentence id="1406">Sometimes...oh...when I called save us in Jewish, always to my</sentence><sentence id="1408">5 mother, in my

times that it was like a miracle happened that I started again to believe.</sentence><sentence id="1415">But it was times that I were...I was not believing, not believing in nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1416">How we were liberated, now I will tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1417">We were 20 and a half months in this <span class="NPIP">hell</span> over there, in this <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">They wre terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1419">We made believe that we have a gun so them to be a little bit scared.</sentence><sentence id="1420">They never went to <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because they were scared that it will cave in.</sentence><sentence id="1421">And one time it...my brother was still alive...it started to cave in.</sentence><sentence id="1422">Because over us was like...like two yards of...of ground, and it was 2 weeks before my hus...my brother was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1423">It started to cave in and...and...uh...but then my brother and this boy, they support us with wood...with wood and later night time...we didn't go in the morning to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because it would not be safe.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And this was only 2 weeks before they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1425">They were working so hard.</sentence><sentence id="1426">They save...they save us, but they went to death only because of us.</sentence><sentence id="1427">Because when they wouldn't come to visit us, they wouldn't be caught and they wouldn't be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1428">But because of us, and I begged him, "Don't go."</sentence><sentence id="1429">I was happy to see... to see them.</sentence><sentence id="1430">But I was scared that they will be...every time when they left, I was only listening what the will bring and they wasn't caught.</sentence><sentence id="1431">And they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="1432">The third time when they came they were caught...caught.</sentence><sentence id="1433">So they were only 3 months hiding and they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And so we started the diary to write.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And my sister not one time told me, "I want...I wish...I wish the Germans would find us and kills us already.</sentence><sentence id="1436">For what we live?" "</sentence><sentence id="1437">February, we will not live through.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And sometimes she throwed the...the... diary, and she said, "For what I am writing.</sentence><sentence id="1439">What they will use.</sentence><sentence id="1440">They will kill us.</sentence><sentence id="1441">We will...we will never be free from here.</sentence><sentence id="1442">They will kill us.</sentence><sentence id="1443">What they will do with this?</sentence><sentence id="1444">They will use this for toilet paper."</sentence><sentence id="1445">But I encouraged her again because I knew when not we will get crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1446">One time...
