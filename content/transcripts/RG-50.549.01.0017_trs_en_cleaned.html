<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">Anita Frank 3 [Date not labeled] Page 3 with the NS Bay,(ph) which was the Dutch Nazi Party.</sentence><sentence id="2">At least four, five times, so, it was tenuous.</sentence><sentence id="3">And, and the reasons they had the raids, they didn't want to betray us.</sentence><sentence id="4">They did not.</sentence><sentence id="5">They hoped that if they were caught, at least that we children would be safe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: And the Dutch, just before this interview when we were talking for a couple minutes, you mentioned that it was a small percentage of the Dutch who, who actually didn't betray Jews.</sentence><sentence id="12">Can you talk a little bit more about, | mean, obviously that's how you survived, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Was because we were not betrayed.</sentence><sentence id="16">| need to stress, I, what, what my sense about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> during the war was based on, based on history, basically, data and in retrospect, is that there was a small percentage perhaps five, five percent, if that many who actively tried to help Jews if, I'm not sure there were that many, who were, who risked their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="17">And they were truly the noble, the very noble people, because it's hard to ask people to do that for others.</sentence><sentence id="18">So, about five percent perhaps that, I'm not even sure it was, were that many, that actually, actively did something.</sentence><sentence id="19">My feeling is that 80 percent didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="20">I'm not saying that they would have betrayed but also that they didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="21">But we had a significant, | would say fifty to twenty percent who were traitors.</sentence><sentence id="22">A huge percentage that were part of the, they belonged to the NS Bay(ph) which is the National Socialist Party, actively, who actively worked with the, with the Nazis, with the Germans and betrayed Jews.</sentence><sentence id="23">Most Dutch Jews probably were betrayed by Dutch rather than those were in hiding.| think they, they said something like 35,000 were in hiding, 15,000 were betrayed.</sentence><sentence id="24">Anita Frank 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 That's a significant number.</sentence><sentence id="25">Probably mostly by the Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="26">Dutch people who got a few dollars for it, a few guilders which the Dutch thing.</sentence><sentence id="27">They got guilders so each person had a, had a monetary value attached.</sentence><sentence id="28">And <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> only now is coming to terms with the fact that as a, as a people, they were not, they were not all that, | hate to say this, they were not all that different from the German people in that a lot of them just turned their heads.</sentence><sentence id="29">Most just turned their heads, let it happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Did you ever talk to Betty Booka(ph) about this, later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: What were her thoughts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Well, she was truly one of the extraordinary heroines, a remarkable woman who, because of her background, the Quaker background, she was British, one of the Cadbury(ph) families.</sentence><sentence id="53">She couldn't tolerate what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="54">From the very beginning, she couldn't tolerate this kind of injustice and absolutely, absolutely made it part of her, her life, her commitment to save as many as she could.</sentence><sentence id="55">And this was who she was. _</sentence><sentence id="56">This was her, her mission in life and that's what | gather, was true for most of the rescuers.</sentence><sentence id="57">They saw something happening that was so intolerable to them that, that they could not live with themselves and let this, let this happen to others.</sentence><sentence id="58">And they, they, they basically did what they, they did what they did because they couldn't do anything else.</sentence><sentence id="59">Those are the rescuers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: How many people did she save, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Oh, she, tens | would say because, | didn't realize there were other Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, course we didn't know that there were.</sentence><sentence id="71">But there were others, she hid Anita Frank 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 other Jews and helped others to hide others and there was a whole system the she and her husband Case(ph) created.</sentence><sentence id="72">They, they.</sentence><sentence id="73">there was a group of Jewish children living close by that they took care of and tried to save.</sentence><sentence id="74">So they, throughout the war, went out of their way to, to save, to save Jewish children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: And could have died themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Oh yes, as a matter of fact, one of the terrifying stories was that, there was a, an act of sabotage.</sentence><sentence id="85">Some, some underground, members of the underground blew up a, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Nazi munitions and they, they took Case Booka(ph), in to, to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and they said, "unless those who had planned this act, this sabotage and who had done it, that, that Case Booka(ph) would be shot.</sentence><sentence id="86">And one of the, one of the, one of the perpetrators of this, of blowing up, who blew up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was a young Jewish man.</sentence><sentence id="87">And he gave himself up.</sentence><sentence id="88">He did not want Case(ph) to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="89">And he was immediately tortured and shot, this young man.</sentence><sentence id="90">And he was part of the, he was in the Underground but he was Jewish, also.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: What year was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: In 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: My God.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="105">Oh yeah, they endangered themselves, the Bookas(ph) endangered, anybody who hid Jews endangered themselves.</sentence><sentence id="106">And the family, it was interesting cause | just spent, as | said, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in April, just, just a few months ago and | spent quite a bit of time with the daughters, three of the daughters of the Booka family.</sentence><sentence id="107">And | asked them if they knew we were Jewish and you know what?</sentence><sentence id="108">They Anita Frank 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6 really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="109">They, it wasn't discussed, it was never discussed.</sentence><sentence id="110">They just knew that they, that they had to help hide people.</sentence><sentence id="111">But it was all, it was all hidden and it was just part of their, of their ethic that they would not cooperate and collaborate with the Nazis and they would do what they could to help those in need.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Do you think Betty and Case(ph) didn't tell them just, to not give them information that they might betray by mistake?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="123">Nottoimplicate.</sentence><sentence id="124">Right.</sentence><sentence id="125">And it was Betty by the way, it was, in retrospect, it was Betty who insisted doing this, not Case(ph).</sentence><sentence id="126">| don't know, we're not even sure Case(ph) knew we were Jewish, because they took in other children.</sentence><sentence id="127">It was Betty who did it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: What kind of woman was she?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Extraordinary, a gentle, little, beautiful, sweetest face in the world, kind, caring, concerned, loving, extraordinary woman who, who just, she couldn't do anything different.</sentence><sentence id="137">And we stayed in close touch with her after the war and she came to visit us and whenever we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, of course, we visited her until she died.</sentence><sentence id="138">And, and the interesting thing about her is, she was so concerned about others that in some way, she neglected her own children.</sentence><sentence id="139">She had eight children, they had eight children themselves and, and that, you see that often in those who are truly committed to the well-being of others that, very often, there is some, you, you sort of assume your own children will manage.</sentence><sentence id="140">So | think, |, | think there's some bitterness there now, among her children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: You sense that when you talk to them?</sentence><sentence id="147">Anita Frank 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="149">Yeah, they admired her, they loved her very much but | still have a real sense that they themselves did not probably, did not get what they needed because Betty was so concerned for, for others.</sentence><sentence id="150">You only have so much energy.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you ever see her show emotion during the war over the situation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="154">No, because basically we were told never to tell anybody and so, we didn't except those little lapses.</sentence><sentence id="155">And | didn't even know that she knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="156">| can remember, and that was, that was just the whole thing that | was so torn up about.</sentence><sentence id="157">| mean, we were told never to tell anybody, so as far as we were concerned, we were non-Jewish children living with these people and | had no idea who knew and who didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="158">So | couldn't tell anybody.</sentence><sentence id="159">So it was that, that horrendous fear of being discovered that stayed with me and the inability to talk to anybody about it, for two years.</sentence><sentence id="160">So all!</sentence><sentence id="161">knew was that we had to be there because we'd be killed but | did not know that Betty knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="162">It turned out she did but really, most others didn't, in the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Have you seen any of the other children who stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="176">Yeah, well no, that's not true, where, as a matter of fact yes we did, | did, just in, in April.</sentence><sentence id="177">Eric, Eric State(ph) was there, the whole time we were there, my brother and | were there.</sentence><sentence id="178">Eric lived there and Eric has, he had a, | don't know, | think he had a serious illness and so he's, he's, almost a form of autism and he's now, so we saw him, | saw him for the first in 50 years.</sentence><sentence id="179">We visited him in his, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">In Julia,(ph), no it was Kondia Booka(ph) and | went to visit.</sentence><sentence id="181">Anita Frank 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: But your brother went with you to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>?</sentence><sentence id="183">Who, who did you say went with you?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="184">Or did you go with your husband?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Oh with my husband.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: No, no, my brother tragically just died.</sentence><sentence id="190">My, the, my brother with whom | was in hiding, Norman, just died April, May 28", May 29" of pancreatic cancer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Yeah, yeah, that was very sad and that was the terrifying thing of going to Europe and knowing, not knowing whether he would live.</sentence><sentence id="196">He didn't, he did live until we returned and we were able to be with him but now he tragically died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Oh boy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: You said that your, your father said your mother's couraged, courage saved the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Can you elaborate on that please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: It was my mother, my father admitted that he was in total despair at times and that when they were in hiding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Falkenburg</span>, well in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, she saved my father's life by taking the, | talked about that on the tape, taking the Cross of Merit to the, that her father had earned in World War | to the German commander of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And who in effect excused my father from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> where they took first, they first took the men to, totally debilitate the families.</sentence><sentence id="211">And so she did that and then my father Anita Frank 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 said many times that during the war, when in effect the, the police would come and when in effect they were told to produce papers that they couldn't produce, and when in effect these threats were made of transporting us, of, of interrogating us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because they notified my parents this might happen, that my father said she, he would just be in despair and my mother just would support him and encourage him and say, "No, let's, lets go and see what we can do and let's contact Frompinksteron(ph) but be careful about it," and she just, she just, she just is the one who, who persevered.</sentence><sentence id="212">She's the one who said to Pete, this policeman, "Pete, you don't want to know these questions, don't ask us."</sentence><sentence id="213">| mean, she would come up, it's almost like her intuition allowed her to do the right things at the right time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Because that was dangerous.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Exceedingly dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="222">It would have been the end of it again.</sentence><sentence id="223">I, had he been with the Nazi, the NS Bay(ph), that would have been the end of the family.</sentence><sentence id="224">But she took risks, somehow almost intuitively knowing what was to, at the same time, she didn't want him to continue asking because she did not want him to know this information.</sentence><sentence id="225">So it was just amazing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: | wonder what, how he answered to his superiors when he didn't get ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: He said things are fine, probably.</sentence><sentence id="234">Probably went back and said things are okay, and looked at the papers and things are okay.</sentence><sentence id="235">He covered up for them, whoever this Pete was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Amazing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="243">Anita Frank 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: But then after the war, my mother suffered horrendously.</sentence><sentence id="245">She never recovered.</sentence><sentence id="246">Then she had her nervous breakdowns and then she turned from really this, this very positive, | gathered from my cousin who still lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who adored, who lived a year with my parents before the war, who, she just said my mother was the most loving and positive and, and, and affectionate woman.</sentence><sentence id="247">But after the war, she just, that was all.</sentence><sentence id="248">| can't say it was all lost, she remained very caring but she became so bitter and so unhappy and so distraught, so desperate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Well, your family had a very difficult time in those early years right after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: Economically, <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: Terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: What were, besides the British censorship job, what were some of the other jobs your father did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Well, he didn't, | think that was his first job.</sentence><sentence id="265">We came, we were liberated in, in September, September 17", "44, in Lindbergh,(ph), in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Howtem(ph</span>), we stayed and then we moved to, we moved to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the, where the, traitor's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and the woman was forced to take us in.</sentence><sentence id="266">Then in April of 40, "45, just before, just before the end of World War Il in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> which was May, | think it was May five, May 5", when <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="267">In April we went to, back to and we lived in this bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and his first job there was with English censorship so my mother was left alone with us.</sentence><sentence id="268">And then he came back from that and then he went back to the Ferda(ph) which was the, the <span class="BUILDING">clothing factory</span> <span class="BUILDING">Anita Frank 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11 with whom he'd worked before the war so he went back to them and then, after that, he left them and went to another clothing, worked for another <span class="BUILDING">clothing manufacturers</span>, as a representative.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: A salesman?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: A salesman, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="278">They called them factory representatives.</sentence><sentence id="279">He would go to <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and, and, and, yeah, sell their, their line of clothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Which probably, or was that a difficult job after the war given the, the economy of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Yeah, it was very hard but he had some old customers who when they, who had, as a matter of fact one of his customers was very helpful to us during the war.</sentence><sentence id="286">They hid some of my parents" silver and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lindbergh(ph</span>), northern Lindbergh(ph), and Findlow(ph), and they were, they were very helpful to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="287">So when my, my father again took that job, they, | think they bought from him.</sentence><sentence id="288">He was a lousy salesman.</sentence><sentence id="289">He, he should never have been into <span class="BUILDING">sales</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">But it was his whole family's business but my father was an intellectual and he should never have been a salesperson.</sentence><sentence id="291">He was, hated that, wasn't good at it, totally honest, totally ethical, totally non-pushy, totally not the characteristics of somebody who's going to make it big in sales, exact opposite.</sentence><sentence id="292">Oh, I'm probably insulting salespeople now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: So, in other words, those first few years, economically your family was, would you describe it as on the edge?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Oh, we were continually on the edge.</sentence><sentence id="304">| mean, we came back with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="305">Our, my, my mother, because she came from a very wealthy family had, had, we'd lived Anita Frank 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother had all these gorgeous things which were all mostly taken away, also by Dutch people who didn't return them to us after the war.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: My mother never recovered.</sentence><sentence id="867">As a matter of fact, one of the great horrors to, to think about how, how you can never forget, is because you never forget, is that as she became, as she became more demented, | hate that word, as she began to lose her memory more, the past started coming back and she became terrified that the, that the Gestapo was around.</sentence><sentence id="868">When she was my sister she said, "Who are these people <span class="NPIP">outside</span>?</sentence><sentence id="869">Are they, is that the Gestapo?</sentence><sentence id="870">Close the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, don't let "em see us."</sentence><sentence id="871">When, when she was me, | start crying every time | think about that, is that she, at one point, she was sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and she said, "Anita," she said, "Did my sister die a natural death?"</sentence><sentence id="872">| know, her sister died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="873">And | said yes she did.| mean,| wasn't about to say to her, no she died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">But, and then, and then when friends came to visit and they were very lovely to her, after they left she Anita Frank 27 [Date not labeled] Page 27 said, "Do they know we're Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="875">So she was back, she was back.</sentence><sentence id="876">And then she would sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and she'd say, "I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="877">And | said, "Where do you want to go?"</sentence><sentence id="878">And she was thinking, she want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to her parents.</sentence><sentence id="879">That's, that's, and | said, "I'm afraid, I'm afraid that your parents aren't here anymore."</sentence><sentence id="880">And she'd say, "Oh, that's right, they're dead."</sentence><sentence id="881">But she wanted, she wanted something, | know, | know what she, she wanted to go back to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she was safe.</sentence><sentence id="882">And really after the war | don't think there was anymore safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for her.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Jews.</sentence><sentence id="905">Basically, the message in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was to Jews, is come on, why don't you just forget it, just, just, like this woman | heard on

my, my present behavior.</sentence><sentence id="921">But the, the reality is, is that those of us who went through it will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="922">And so to listen to people telling me that we should just forget it, |, | want to shoot "em.</sentence><sentence id="923">And one of the most striking memories is when the <span class="DLF">Berlin Wall</span> came down, PBS had a program in which they talked about how wonderful it was to have the <span class="DLF">wall</span> come down but recognizing that, that some of the Jew survivors, the Holocaust survivors weren't so

that meant.</sentence><sentence id="924">Basically, what it meant to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="925">And, and the interviewer went to an <span class="BUILDING">ethnic restaurant</span>, a German

<span class="DLF">wall</span> coming down, about, in terms of what it means for a united <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="928">And her response was, "Ahh, why can't they just forget it?"</sentence><sentence id="929">| wanted to kill her.</sentence><sentence id="930">1, 1, not that | never would, because | can't but that's, that was my thought.</sentence><sentence id="931">You miserable witch.</sentence><sentence id="932">If, if | had Anita Frank 29 [Date not labeled] Page 29 been there, I, | don't know what | would have done to her because how can we

class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="936">And, we had to start from scratch.</sentence><sentence id="937">| went to a wonderful wedding yesterday with Jewish family, dear wonderful, wonderful friends and they were blessed.</sentence><sentence id="938">Hundreds, they had a hundred of their relatives there and their families had left Europe, thank God, in the, in the early 1900's, came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="939">Even though they'd lost distant relatives, they were able to come with their families and build and have

had to start from scratch.</sentence><sentence id="942">We're starting with our little family and | must say, we lost more than most.</sentence><sentence id="943">We lost most, my father had seven

why, how, how was Hitler possible and, and | just, as | said we had answers to that, we'd know better.</sentence><sentence id="1004">But!</sentence><sentence id="1005">mean |, when | put in context is, is we have had two years, two thousand years, perhaps that's a little bit, no, really two thousand of unmitigated anti-Semitism in, in, in Europe, perhaps 1500.</sentence><sentence id="1006">Bult, certainly, the Crusades, the, the Inquisition in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, | mean, blaming Jews for the plague.</sentence><sentence id="1007">| mean it, all you have to do is go through European history and if you look at the Bible, this increasing anti-Semitism, this, this hatred of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1008">You see that developing in the Bible, it wasn't, that was not the original, the original disciples were not, they were Jews themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1009">But you see, as, as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> became Christian, they of course had to, to blame Jesus" death, not on the, the, the, the Romans but they had to blame it on the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And you see this shift, this shift in the Bible itself to an increasingly more anti-Semitic perspective about Jews as Christ killers.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And that became the great montra(ph) in, in European Christianity.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Both Catholicism, Lutheranism is Jews the Christ killers, Jews the blood-suckers, the Jews the Damned, Jews are not gonna go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, it's only the select Christians who somehow have got the one right answer who are gonna go, who are gonna go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And so you have the dominant religion which of course Christianity is, in, in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1014">You've got the dominant religion saying of another group of people that they're damned and they're gonna go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and they're, they suck the blood of Christian children.</sentence><sentence id="1015">It becomes, they become the, the Jews, the dirty Jews, the ones, the dangerous people and then of course with the, with the Christians curtailing the Anita Frank 33 [Date not labeled] Page 33 Jewish, the Jewish, the possibility for Jews, jobs, professions and so on, were in a, in effect, Jews can only be, they could lend money because it was dirty for Christians to lend money.</sentence><sentence id="1016">So they could do the dirty jobs.</sentence><sentence id="1017">And then Jews become successful there, they're being killed because they did.</sentence><sentence id="1018">They became the money lenders and you have Shakespeare and Merchant of Venice and Charlotan(ph), that perpetrating those horrors.</sentence><sentence id="1019">And, and so you've got a whole culture of anti-Semitism which was, you have it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with the Dryfuss(ph) Affair, | mean you have it all through Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1020">In, in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> with the progroms, you have it all through Europe throughout with intermittent periods where in effect certain rulers(ph) who'd be tolerant of the Jews because they could use them.</sentence><sentence id="1021">So it wasn't unmitigated, | mean it wasn't totally consistent but it certainly was consistent over time with periods of, of, of some, of some allowance to, to let Jews live their lives and flourish.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And | must say that's where <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> has had us, on the whole, a, a better history, not perfect but certainly a better history of tolerance for Jews because they did allow the Sofottic(ph) Jews with the Inquisition to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> has had a relatively, extraodinarily wonderful history of, of religious freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1023">And has allowed its Jews to live in relative peace.</sentence><sentence id="1024">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with all of its, its effort that becoming a nation-state which it didn't become until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bismarck</span> with all of its in-fighting and then, and, and a population which is the same as in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, this, this, a population that has as its dogma the Christian belief that if you just, the Calvinistic belief if, if you just do everything right and you follow God's word and you do it, then good things are gonna come to you.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And that basically, you obey.</sentence><sentence id="1026">It's very Anita Frank 34 [Date not labeled] Page 34 important to do what you're told, not to question this sort of authoritarian, sort of ethic of, of, of children must listen to their parents, children must obey, children must not question.</sentence><sentence id="1027">Father knows best.</sentence><sentence id="1028">So you've got this, this sort of a cultural pattern of not questioning what goes on, a religious pattern of, if something bad happens to people, they deserve it.</sentence><sentence id="1029">And then a historical pattern of extreme anti-Semitism, then you've got this great combination that when things go bad, as of course Hitler came to power after this horrendous inflation, well, first the defeat for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in World War | which was a horrendous blow to their morale and then, this, this terrible inflation that impoverished millions of people.</sentence><sentence id="1030">What you do is you find a scapegoat.</sentence><sentence id="1031">And Hitler, Hitler was always a rabid anti-Semite.</sentence><sentence id="1032">But people become very vulnerable to, becoming comfortable to, yes, it's all the Jews" fault.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Blame somebody else, | mean we do it in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> all the time, is blaming somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="1034">Blame the immigrants.</sentence><sentence id="1035">Blame, blame the illegal aliens.</sentence><sentence id="1036">Blame everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1037">Even blame outside terrorists when we're breeding our own terrorists.</sentence><sentence id="1038">We have the militia who is so dangerous here.</sentence><sentence id="1039">So you blame, you start blaming others.</sentence><sentence id="1040">And then everybody else is doing it and it becomes really comfortable and then you obey orders and you don't question and you become self-satisfied and smug because things are getting better.</sentence><sentence id="1041">It's not, not difficult then to understand the Jews, the traditional scapegoat in Europe became an obvious scapegoat here.</sentence><sentence id="1042">And then with German propaganda, they did an unbelievable job of painting Jews as rats.</sentence><sentence id="1043">As <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">vermin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1044">Destroying the fiber of the great Aryan nation.</sentence><sentence id="1045">And that propaganda is, is staggering, you see some of those propaganda films.</sentence><sentence id="1046">So you put all that together, it's Anita Frank 35 [Date not labeled] Page 35 not surprising.</sentence><sentence id="1047">It's not difficult to make people hate others.</sentence><sentence id="1048">And that's why for me, questioning, always questioning, never accepting what people tell you without really examining the validity of any of it and never allowing others to dictate your moral stands.</sentence><sentence id="1049">It's just so vital.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1945">A: Oh, | broke all the rules.</sentence><sentence id="1946">| broke every rule and that is that the classic rules of counseling are that all these worries about transference and counter-transference and all this other garbage and how you need to let the patient come up with all the solutions and how you don't insert yourself into it and how you don't, all these things.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1947">| broke every single one of those rules.</sentence><sentence id="1948">And what | basically, what I, the way | perceived it, it was more reeducating people, the way | had to reeducate myself and that is to help people to begin to define, learn how to define themselves and, and begin to appreciate themselves and how, how to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1949">I've got a whole schema for doing that and, and | would come up with ideas but always in such a way that | would say look.</sentence><sentence id="1950">I'm just gonna share these with you.</sentence><sentence id="1951">These are tools.</sentence><sentence id="1952">It, everything is in your control.</sentence><sentence id="1953">Everything is within your power so always leave you the power and leave in the control with, with my clients.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And as a result, | could develop very equal relationships and people never saw me as telling what to do but it was a sharing which was super healing.</sentence><sentence id="1955">It, it just, and it was amazing how quickly people, not everybody but an overwhelming majority were able to just begin to look at their life from a different perspective and learn different ways of dealing with it.</sentence><sentence id="1956">Anita Frank 59 [Date not labeled] Page 59</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1957">Q: So in other words, you didn't exercise that power that the authority figure or expert has?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1958">A: Exactly, never.</sentence><sentence id="1959">| was never the expert.</sentence><sentence id="1960">| always let them know they were the expert.</sentence><sentence id="1961">All that | had were some tools and some ideas that | was willing to share with them.</sentence><sentence id="1962">But they had to tell me whether they fit it, they might not, and | would tell them, look, this may not be right for you.</sentence><sentence id="1963">Let me know, you know better than | do.</sentence><sentence id="1964">If we talk about something that, that you don't, you find offensive, let me know.</sentence><sentence id="1965">So that it was, | was, I've never been the expert.</sentence><sentence id="1966">| mean, and I, in my work at the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, I'm trying to teach our medical students, that as future physicians, it's still the patient who is the expert on the patient.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1978">A: It's not the physician.</sentence><sentence id="1979">The physician may be the expert on the disease and on some treatment but the patient is the expert on, on what's wrong with the patient and if you don't respect that and don't elicit from the patient what's going on and what they think what's going on, you're gonna lose three quarters of your information.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1980">And particularly true in management of illness is that, always three quarters of that is within the patient's domain.</sentence><sentence id="1981">Because | can't prescribe, | mean, that's why | will tell with my clients, | mean | can suggest that you might try this but it's up to you to do it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1982">Now is this going to be possible for you?</sentence><sentence id="1983">And some of them will say, yes and | say well, how do you see yourself doing this?</sentence><sentence id="1984">It's letting always your clients come up with a plan, always have them, have them come up with the ideas as much as possible about what's gonna work for them.</sentence><sentence id="1985">And have them be in charge of their own healing Anita Frank 60 [Date not labeled] Page 60 because only then is there gonna be a chance that they will actually pursue the ideas.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1986">But if | tell somebody else what to do, the chance of "em doing it are very small.</sentence><sentence id="1987">It shouldn't, and so to that, and, but where | differ from classic counseling is that | will come up with, | will say, | won't say a lot of counseling is how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this, how do you feel about this.</sentence><sentence id="1988">|, like you feel about it is only marginally useful.</sentence><sentence id="1989">| much more focus, okay, what are you gonna do about it.</sentence><sentence id="1990">I'm much more focused</sentence><sentence id="1991">Anita Frank 61 [Date not labeled] Page 61 Tape 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1992">A: Well, it's, it's going back to, to my, my the difference is that, and that, that has, that goes back to my history is you need to understand how your past has impacted on you.</sentence><sentence id="1993">That's critical because otherwise you remain a victim of your past.</sentence><sentence id="1994">But then you need to free yourself from your past as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1995">Now, | won't ever be able to free myself completely and that's okay because | should never forget.</sentence><sentence id="1996">But what | can do and what also my clients mostly need to do is they need to overcome the horrendous messages of their childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1997">They need to take control over their lives and so | prefer focusing on the healing process instead of on the, just on the past.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2024">A: Problem-based learning.</sentence><sentence id="2025">It basically means that they have, it's a modified problem-based learning so they meet in tutorial groups and there is a lot of responsibility for self learning, for hypothesizing.</sentence><sentence id="2026">| mean all the things, all the things Anita Frank 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 that | think are important, thinking, problem-solving, analyzing and my job as the behavioral scientist, | see as my maior job is to, to teach our medical students to see patients at the partners, as their partners and not as diseases because <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> is heavily biological and so our, our physicians are trained to look at the disease process and at very little else.</sentence><sentence id="2027">And so my maior job is to keep the patient in mind, and to keep the patient as the focus and to deal with the patient as a partner and not just as the carrier of a disease.</sentence><sentence id="2028">And it's very exciting and, and I'm particularly interested in the management treatment part of it where basically the patient should, we should have very different approaches.</sentence><sentence id="2029">Physicians have a tendency to tell patients what to do, this is what you should, without explaining much, without looking at a patient's circumstances to see whether in effect they can one, buy the medicine, take, take the medicine.</sentence><sentence id="2030">Can they relax, can they adhere, do they understand what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="2031">What are the pressures, what are the miseries, what are the situations at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2032">| mean, you can tell somebody to stop smoking, well, that's not gonna to do a bit of good.</sentence><sentence id="2033">You need to understand what role smoking plays in this, this person's life.</sentence><sentence id="2034">And are they interested in quitting?</sentence><sentence id="2035">And where are they and how often have they tried?</sentence><sentence id="2036">So, it's a, it's a much of a comprehensive, patient-centered approach.</sentence><sentence id="2037">Very respectful of the patient.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2078">Q: It's exciting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2080">A: It is.</sentence><sentence id="2081">They're wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2082">It's a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2086">Q: It also sounds good on the level that | interviewed a doctor for a story | was working on recently and he said, "People don't realize how prone physicians are to problems; drug problems, stress, enormous, enormous stress."</sentence><sentence id="2087">So it sounds like perhaps this gives them some tools to work on their problems too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2090">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Verynice.</sentence><sentence id="2092">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2093">Because we expect physicians to be super-human.</sentence><sentence id="2094">And they're just people, bright people on the whole, and caring people on the whole.</sentence><sentence id="2095">But that's all they are.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And one of the great tragedies is is that in the traditional approach, our physicians are taught, it becomes, because they tend to be obsessive- compulsive, they tend to be perfectionists, they tend to be hard-driven and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2097">What they want to do is they want to fix things.</sentence><sentence id="2098">And they're happy when they can fix something.</sentence><sentence id="2099">And when they can't fix something, they get very unhappy and very stressed and so what happens very often is that, particularly during the dying process when they can't do anymore for a patient, they abandon the patient.</sentence><sentence id="2100">Because they can't do anymore.</sentence><sentence id="2101">And so you see this avoidance behavior.</sentence><sentence id="2102">That's because Anita Frank 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 they're uncomfortable.</sentence><sentence id="2103">They can't, they can't fix, the other focus for me is is that there is very little fixing you guys can do.</sentence><sentence id="2104">If you're lucky you can cut out a, you can cure a bacterial illness with some antibiotics and you can cut out a cancer and you can do, you can do some other things that truly fix things.</sentence><sentence id="2105">But most of the time, it isn't as simple as that.</sentence><sentence id="2106">Most of the time you just have to learn to work with your patient to make it as, to make it better.</sentence><sentence id="2107">But that means you need to be in partnership with your patient.</sentence><sentence id="2108">And don't worry so much about fixing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2129">Q: And, and don't take all the responsibility.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2131">A: Don't take all the responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="2132">Leave the responsibility where it belongs but then behave in ways that you communicate that clearly.</sentence><sentence id="2133">1, that's certainly what I've done in my counseling, always left the power with my clients.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Always.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3210">A: Well, again, |, | sort of, | think I'm the kind of person who's easily interested in what goes on around her and so after | married Alan and | was thinking now what am | gonna do with my life and my masters in Russian Studies didn't help me much here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albuquerque</span>, <span class="REGION">New Mexico</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3211">| decided well I'm go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and basically | got pregnant and went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at exactly the same time.</sentence><sentence id="3212">And just started taking child development courses and fell in love with those like I'd like fallen in love with Russian foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="3213">| just found them fascinating and I've never taken a psychology course at <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> so, it was just a whole new world opening for me.</sentence><sentence id="3214">So again, it just, | found something else that interested me. _</sentence><sentence id="3215">| think Anita Frank 92 [Date not labeled] Page 92 that's how my life is.</sentence><sentence id="3216">I'm, I'm easily interested in what's going on in the world so, |, I've lots of, | get excited about a whole bunch of things.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3234">Q: Did you let him know how he was doing as he went along?</sentence><sentence id="3235">Did you say, when he spoke his first word did you say good, Loren(ph), you're a month ahead of schedule?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3238">A: No, but it was very clear to me from the very beginning that he clearly was a very bright child so | was a very proud obnoxious mother, I'm afraid.</sentence><sentence id="3239">He, and | encouraged that enormously, interesting.</sentence><sentence id="3240">That's certainly part of my heritage is that | didn't care if he was an athlete or not, at all.</sentence><sentence id="3241">| couldn't have cared less.</sentence><sentence id="3242">What | did care about was his intellectual development.</sentence><sentence id="3243">And if he had wanted to punish me all he would have had to do is flunk out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3244">Because forme, education has been the absolutely essential ingredient for taking control of life and, and so when he was developing into this incredibly delightful bright kid, .</sentence><sentence id="3245">Anita Frank 93 [Date not labeled] Page 93 Tape 4</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3255">Q: Could you just say that again about what he, he turned out to be as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3257">A: [talkover] He turned out to be exactly the kind of child that | had hoped for.</sentence><sentence id="3258">| mean, | don't think | could have designed a child more to my <span class="NPIP">dreams</span> than Loren(ph) actually turned out to be, so what a fortunate parent | am.</sentence><sentence id="3259">| give him 95 percent of the credit, I'll take about five.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3263">Q: How much does Alan get?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3265">A: Alan gets, well, he, he's included the 95.</sentence><sentence id="3266">Alan gets five, | get five and Loren(ph) gets 90.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3269">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3270">Let's see.</sentence><sentence id="3271">| think that might be, oh, |, just | think this is it but 1, | wanted to just ask you to talk about something we talked about before we started the tape and that was your, what you like about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> being a self-examining society of sorts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3275">Would you mind ending with that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3276">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3277">Well, | think that, that's really significant from my perspective and that is that one of the great blessings from my perspective about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is, is that we've made a lot of mistakes.</sentence><sentence id="3278">You and | talked a little bit before we put the tape on, we talked a little bit about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>'s role during the war and the fact that the State Department had lots of anti-Semites in it and, and that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> knew, the government knew was happening to Jews and didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="3279">That | think Roosevelt tried, there, absolutely no support for it, that the Jewish Underground begged the British and Americans who bombed the <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and that, there were no bombs available or some excuses were given why Anita Frank 94 [Date not labeled] Page 94 that couldn't be done.</sentence><sentence id="3280">And how many lives could have been saved if, if some relatively simple measures had been taken.</sentence><sentence id="3281">And that then of course then <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> invited all these Nazis, these Nazi scientists, Gunter(ph), what is it, Gunter von Braun(ph), that was the guy, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and, and to work on the weapons programs here.</sentence><sentence id="3282">And we've hidden, | mean, we still, we're discovering Nazis left and right still.</sentence><sentence id="3283">It's pretty late now.</sentence><sentence id="3284">So | think this, and of course the, the horror of not letting the Jews and the, they, they, the ones who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> | think or Bramen(ph) on the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, St. Louis and they were refused entry here and had to go back to an, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3285">So, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has no, has not an unblemished record, far from it in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="3286">And that is | think, true in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="3287">|, |, | think there isn't, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> perhaps, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> really had a small number of Jews and they, the king as a leader, behaved nobly and its population followed.</sentence><sentence id="3288">They, as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, get a lot of credit.</sentence><sentence id="3289">And, and |, | expect the, | accept the fact that we all make mistakes but what!</sentence><sentence id="3290">cannot accept is that we don't acknowledge our mistakes.| think one of the great blessings of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is, is we, we allow, we encourage ourselves to examine our past and our policies and our history and we, there is a lot of self-criticism going on.</sentence><sentence id="3291">And there is a lot of, we have a lot of controversy and we have a lot of people who have courage to examine the past and to look at the past and to say this is where we went wrong or this is where we didn't behave appropriately.</sentence><sentence id="3292">And one of the things that has been so missing in Europe has been that honest self-examination.</sentence><sentence id="3293">And, and you even know it, you go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">war museum</span> and the, the, the kind of sickening chauvinism of the French Anita Frank 95 [Date not labeled] Page 95 is just enough to, to appall anybody.</sentence><sentence id="3294">And that is a, if you look at their <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, it's as if Charles de Gaulle(ph) won the war.</sentence><sentence id="3295">There is absolutely nothing about French treachery.</sentence><sentence id="3296">There's nothing about French cooperation with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3297">There's nothing about the police's happy cooperation, rounding of the Jews and betraying Jews, there is nothing of that in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3298">Only now are they coming to terms with it.</sentence><sentence id="3299">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> also, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is better.</sentence><sentence id="3300">It's now beginning to examine its past but it's taken them so long.</sentence><sentence id="3301">For the longest time <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> had this, whenever | talked about <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> not having been so, such a glorious <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> during the war, people said surprised, "Oh, | thought they were so noble."</sentence><sentence id="3302">Cause <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> fostered that.</sentence><sentence id="3303">We the noble Dutch, we resisted the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3304">Well they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3305">Some did.</sentence><sentence id="3306">Butno whole population can take credit for the enormous courage of a few and, and so, to me, one of the great poisonous, and, and | must admit | think that's where <span class="REGION">western Germany</span> has, has done a relatively good job is they have a significant number of people who, who are aware of how vital it's been to examine their past.</sentence><sentence id="3307">But overall, it's taken them a long time, too.</sentence><sentence id="3308">And where in <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span>, this hasn't happened at all.</sentence><sentence id="3309">And where you see these, these fascist movements rising.</sentence><sentence id="3310">You see it in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, you see it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3311">It's, it's scary to me.</sentence><sentence id="3312">And so, from my perspective that's something that we never must stop doing.</sentence><sentence id="3313">We need to always reexamine our past.</sentence><sentence id="3314">We need to learn from history and we need to be critical of ourselves and we need to learn and | applaud this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that, that looks at itself and says, you know what, that stank.</sentence><sentence id="3315">That was no good.</sentence><sentence id="3316">Many of us, it takes a long while to change, but this is, this is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we had McCarthy, that fascist in the fifties, Joseph McCarthy.</sentence><sentence id="3317">Anita Frank 96 [Date not labeled] Page 96 Eventually, he was brought down.</sentence><sentence id="3318">Eventually, we had people of courage who, who brought him down even while this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was scared.</sentence><sentence id="3319">And we need to make sure that we never give rise to other fascists like him who will happily destroy whole people because of this irrational fear of, then it was Communism, infiltration of the Red Menace, and it's just, it's just dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="3320">And so allowing dissent and allowing disagreement and examining ourselves all the time, | think is what's gonna keep this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on a reasonably healthy path.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3373">Q: And at least acceptance that terrible persecution has occurred and recognizing that that was a mistake.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3375">A: Oh, oh you mean in its own history.</sentence><sentence id="3376">Oh sure, | mean slavery and the Japanese.</sentence><sentence id="3377">Yes, | mean terrible, terrible things have happened in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3378">Without question.</sentence><sentence id="3379">And, and but the critical, it wouldn't, that would be even worse if we didn't acknowledge our horrendous mistakes and try to make sure that those things don't happen again.</sentence><sentence id="3380">And that doesn't mean that we're not gonna continue to have misery and racism because I'm not that optimistic about people to be very honest.</sentence><sentence id="3381">I'm just not.</sentence><sentence id="3382">But | think that's where our government needs to take strong stands about people's individual rights and privileges and responsibilities.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3391">Q: Does it scare you at all when you see some of the recent terrorist bombings of say the Olympics and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airliner</span> and so on that then civil liberties will be curbed to try to protect the population at large?</sentence><sentence id="3392">Are there any possible innocent victims?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3395">A: Yeah, that's such a interesting question.</sentence><sentence id="3396">To be honest, | see no infringement of my rights if there're gonna be tracers in these fertilizer things.</sentence><sentence id="3397">That, as far as I'm Anita Frank 97 [Date not labeled] Page 97 concerned, is only sensible.</sentence><sentence id="3398">And to put taps on phones of suspected terrorists, that doesn't, we can exaggerate those potential dangers.</sentence><sentence id="3399">And that's something that really bothers me.</sentence><sentence id="3400">You can look at everything and, and make a huge case out of it and say what if, if, if, yes and as a result you can immobilize people to do absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3401">And so | think we need to be at all times careful that we, that we preserve our liberties but there's also something like the common good.</sentence><sentence id="3402">And we must at all times weigh the common good against the protection of individual liberties.</sentence><sentence id="3403">And | don't think it's just a one-way <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3404">|, | have a firm commitment to the common good, also, and to my, in my opinion, and that's why with gun-control, | am so strongly for gun-control.</sentence><sentence id="3405">| just, just that, this society is so violent and you see it, you see these 12 year old killing each other and killing others.</sentence><sentence id="3406">It's just, it's insanity to, to scream about, from my perspective, about everybody's right to, to bear guns versus the, the community's rights to some, to a sense of safety.</sentence><sentence id="3407">So again, a balance never, | see that generally is the answer to most of life's problems is to find a balance that takes into account both the common and individual rights.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3421">Q: And that will be continued forever, all those discussions of balance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3423">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
