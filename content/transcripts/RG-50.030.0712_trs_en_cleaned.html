upper middle class people, but we weren't by no means rich.</sentence><sentence id="303">Just well off, I guess, comfortable off, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="304">And he -- he was just amazed at how people lived.</sentence><sentence id="305">And he said something to my parents, and my brother felt</sentence><sentence id="307">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 12</span> compelled to answer, so he said, "Yeah, this is all nice, but they call us dirty Jews."</sentence><sentence id="308">So he said, "Well, you can call me anything you want as long as you feed me honey."</sentence><sentence id="309">So that was sort of a -- an indication of -- of a perception of what they had, you know.</sentence><sentence id="310">But other than that, the year went uneventful again, and you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you -- my Uncle Jupiter was not too {Coughs} excited about it because he was a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="311">He - - he did international business with -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and he couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="312">So he was not too excited but, you know, he had to put up and shut up, basically.</sentence><sentence id="313">And when the Naz -- on July 21, 1941, the war started.</sentence><sentence id="314">I mean Nazis invaded.</sentence><sentence id="315">Actually, rolling back, in "39 I remember when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was invaded.</sentence><sentence id="316">How do I remember it is that my mother had taken me for someplace, to some -- somewhere, and we were coming back.</sentence><sentence id="317">And in front of the perfect , the police there, which was the major police entity, there were people sitting on -- on packages on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">And I had asked "Why are they there", and my mother told me that -- this was in September 1939 -- that these people are from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they are refugees.</sentence><sentence id="319">And -- and just as we were standing there, a dog came by and bit my thigh, you know, chubby little thighs of little girls, and that was a big minor crisis.</sentence><sentence id="320">You know, I don't think he broke the skin, I don't remember, just that the idea of it was a major thing.</sentence><sentence id="321">So in 1941 -- and we knew that Hitler had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that there was -- and in 1941, the Nazis, on June 21st, 1941, the Nazis occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> and then everything changed.</sentence><sentence id="322">That was not benign, that was not -- it was -- first of all, it was war, number one, although you didn't feel it that much.</sentence><sentence id="323">But there were -- there were a lot of anti-Semitic outbursts.</sentence><sentence id="324">A lot of <span class="DLF">windows</span> broke and a lot of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> broken and -- I don't -- and lot of Jewish</sentence><sentence id="326">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 13 businesses just simply put out of business.</sentence><sentence id="327">And -- and the Nazis had plans, had made plans to basically make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherowitz</span> , to expel all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="328">Although my Uncle Jupiter was not -- he said, "Oh, they're not gonna do it."</sentence><sentence id="329">And he was -- he was amenable.</sentence><sentence id="330">He was pleased that -- that the Soviets had gone.</sentence><sentence id="331">Oh, let me roll back.</sentence><sentence id="332">In 1939, when Europe was getting just by things not looking so well, the <span class="BUILDING">Ford Motor Company</span> in Michigan had -- had offered my father and his family to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">And my mother said, "Who goes to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="334">Only people that want to get away from a bad wife."</sentence><sentence id="335">Because in Europe, divorce was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="336">Or people that can't make it financially and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="337">So that was one opportunity missed.</sentence><sentence id="338">And -- and when the Soviets were retreating, they offered my dad to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">And my parents were sort of torn, I guess, about that.</sentence><sentence id="340">But Uncle Jupiter said, "No way, don't -- don't you dare", you know, kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="341">So that was the other opportunity that -- that was missed.</sentence><sentence id="342">And in 1941 -- so when they occupied, Jewish children could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">And they -- they started forming a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">All -- all Jews had to move into a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews -- let me roll back.</sentence><sentence id="345">Uncle Jupiter immediately went into business or -- or revived an old business, I'm really not sure.</sentence><sentence id="346">But food transport, eggs, stuff like that was a big business in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="347">I -- I didn't really know that until much later.</sentence><sentence id="348">And he was involved with shipping aid -- you know, transporting food, eggs, dairy, who knows.</sentence><sentence id="349">That business was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">It was, what, 40, 50 miles away in some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">So he was back in -- he was in business immediately.</sentence><sentence id="352">And so when they -- when they tried to make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernowitz</span> , they ordered people to move into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, you know, certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> where Jews had lived and where the <span class="BUILDING">kosher shops</span> were and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="353">But 5,000 people or</sentence><sentence id="355">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 14</span> whatever thousand, I don't know, maybe -- maybe more, maybe 6,000 were permitted to stay in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because they were needed to run the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">I mean they were the professors and the physicians and the businessmen.</sentence><sentence id="357">And we were permitted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and Uncle Jupiter was permitted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and so were -- so was my uncle, my father's brother.</sentence><sentence id="358">And so we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but -- and then these people that had gone to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- so, there is -- apparently there was a list that they put people on, and these people could stay in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">And those that had been put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, some were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transnistria</span>, and some were allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they would have transports later on.</sentence><sentence id="360">Well, we never went so, you know, we were considered not at risk.</sentence><sentence id="361">And this was like in September or in the fall.</sentence><sentence id="362">And the next -- so after the winter, the next deportation -- these were deportations, by the way, they were.</sentence><sentence id="363">The next deportations -- I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">My brother didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">I had a non-Jewish friend that I met in <span class="BUILDING">dancing school</span>, and then in the year -- her name was Adele Havriluk.</sentence><sentence id="366">Her father was a prominent attorney.</sentence><sentence id="367">And then in that one year of schooling that was either <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> or first grade, I don't know which one, and they -- they used to come over and bring me school work.</sentence><sentence id="368">And so to keep me in touch with school work, and -- and bring stuff for my brother.</sentence><sentence id="369">So then in the -- the next deportations were ordered to take place in June of 1942, and they were to be -- to take place on three consecutive Sundays.</sentence><sentence id="370">Oh, my dad -- my dad had a job, so Uncle -- he worked in Uncle Jupiter's business of -- of food transport, had something to do with eggs and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="371">And my dad would travel with Uncle Jupiter every weekend.</sentence><sentence id="372">He would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every weekend.</sentence><sentence id="373">He would travel every Monday, go there.</sentence><sentence id="374">So Jews had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on those three consecutive Sundays, and that</sentence><sentence id="376">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 15</span> didn't affect us the first two Sundays.</sentence><sentence id="377">The third Sunday -- and I had, in fact, said goodbye to some neighbor girl that I knew, whose name | don't even remember, but I know [ had said goodbye to somebody.</sentence><sentence id="378">But the third Sunday, Uncle Jupiter had sent a chauffeur.</sentence><sentence id="379">So Jews couldn't be out, but he -- he could send a chauffeur.</sentence><sentence id="380">And my dad had come back on Friday.</sentence><sentence id="381">He had -- he went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> or he picked up money, had a briefcase full of money, real money, two hundred -- the equivalent of $250,000 to pay wages, to buy material, who knows why.</sentence><sentence id="382">That's what he had.</sentence><sentence id="383">The briefcase was lying in our <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, like the <span class="INT_SPACE">entrance hall</span> had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">And Uncle Jupiter sent the chauffeur Sunday evening about eight o'clock or so to suggest that we come to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, that we stay with -- with them.</sentence><sentence id="385">And my mother said, "Nah, I don't want to go."</sentence><sentence id="386">You know, Max is going to -- back to -- I can't remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where this business was, and he has this money and, you know, Uncle Jupiter was going with him so he knew.</sentence><sentence id="387">And, you know, "Bathe the children, put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">I don't think so."</sentence><sentence id="389">Well, that was our last chance, because in the middle of the night about midnight, the -- the doorbell rang and it was the police, and they said they wanted us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> to check the documents.</sentence><sentence id="390">Don't worry about it, nothing serious, just check the documents.</sentence><sentence id="391">So we dressed.</sentence><sentence id="392">My -- I dressed myself.</sentence><sentence id="393">I remember wearing kneesocks.</sentence><sentence id="394">That's what every kid wore, kneesocks, little kneesocks.</sentence><sentence id="395">And we -- when we got out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, there were -- there was a lot of police and a lot of people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that were going, but we also -- my parents saw, I didn't have the perception to understand it, that somebody was giving some policeman a bag of jewelry and they didn't go, they didn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="396">So -- but, you know, my parents were secure that -- that once he -- they</sentence><sentence id="398">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 16</span> know that he's needed, then the business will open, it won't have any money, that nothing would happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="399">Well, that was obviously wrong.</sentence><sentence id="400">We -- we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a -- like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and we were taken to -- to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="401">And my dad, we didn't have any -- we didn't pack any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>, although some people had taken something.</sentence><sentence id="402">My dad had the briefcase of money, and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="403">And we learned later that the -- that they were short on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">They had to have 2,000 people in the three -- three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, and they were short 120 people on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="405">So they just went into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they knew Jews lived and took them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="406">I mean who's gonna hold them accountable?So that was basically how we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> on the way to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="690">Q:Did you have any sense of what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> meant before that moment?</sentence><sentence id="691">Had you heard about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, or was this the first -- your first experience with it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="694">A:I mean I knew what a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was as a forceable sort of thing, but I -- I didn't really.</sentence><sentence id="695">Neither did my brother.</sentence><sentence id="696">We didn't really.</sentence><sentence id="697">And we sort of relied on -- on something, I'm not sure what that something was.</sentence><sentence id="698">I cannot articulate now.</sentence><sentence id="699">But we relied on status or something that -- that it's gonna turn out okay.</sentence><sentence id="700">And in fact, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that -- that we were on, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>, it stopped in -- outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moghilev</span> someplace, and people were looking for water.</sentence><sentence id="701">Obviously we had no food.</sentence><sentence id="702">Oh, the night before when my mother said, "Oh, we'll stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, bathe the kids, put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>", we were having dinner.</sentence><sentence id="703">Not that -

would just sort of walk around every day.</sentence><sentence id="802">He would come by.</sentence><sentence id="803">And he would see me and he would go by and pull my pigtails and look at the knee

id="820">If you had money, you could buy.</sentence><sentence id="821">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="822">You had to sell stuff to them.</sentence><sentence id="823">But I mean food was

different -- for just older kids, but the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1357">And -- but then he became -- my mother's sisters and Uncle Jupiter had gone to <span

is the -- the dairy trust.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And -- but we didn't have very much of anything.</sentence><sentence id="1361">So -- and we -- and my uncle persuaded us, persuaded my parents to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1362">So that was another sort of using forged papers for --

always.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And it became now a fear of documents.</sentence><sentence id="1371">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> in 19 -- sometime in 1945, and stayed there until 1946 when the -- when the -- or -- or later, maybe -- yeah, "46, late "46 when the Nazis -- when the Soviets were occupying -- you know, the king -- when the king was -- was being ousted, King Michael.</sentence><sentence id="1372">It was becoming communist and it was gonna be communist, and Uncle Jupiter didn't want to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And my -- my

class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 33</span> there because nothing good is gonna come.</sentence><sentence id="1376">We should leave the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1377">So again, you sort of struggle and you -- you -- we lived in a one-room apartment or something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>, like a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">And you struggled to organize documents and visas and all this kind of stuff. {</sentence><sentence id="1379">Coughs} -- and in 1946, we were leaving.</sentence><sentence id="1380">We had a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and a pass-through visa to the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in

Jupiter.</sentence><sentence id="1383">So he paid somebody a lot of money and they -- on the -- the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> was still the <span class="DLF">Hungarian

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, for the right conductor to be able to smuggle him over.</sentence><sentence id="1385">Well, it took a couple weeks and he still hadn't gone.</sentence><sentence id="1386">So he said he would send for the women, when -- his wife and my other aunt when -- when he's on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1387">But then it had become communist already and you couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="1388">So -- but the women had become anxious, so they -- they contacted the smuggler who tried to talk them out of it.</sentence><sentence id="1389">They also paid him a lot of money, and they left their -- their beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, all their possessions, and he took them to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1390">Now, these -- these people must have had a brain freeze, because in a -- in a little <span

something going on.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I mean so when -- when the smuggler -- the smuggler didn't want to take all three of them.</sentence><sentence id="1392">They talked him into it.</sentence><sentence id="1393">He put them on the -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> or something, and of course they were all arrested, arrested and sent -- sentenced to <span

and, you know, it was sort of teaching you life skills and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="1411">Intellectually, we -- we were self-taught.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And came to the <span

basically there.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And, you know, it was a lot of sort of empty time, a lot of -- grew up fast, dating, older people, you know, was kind of -- And my brother -- my brother

id="1514">Don't have to now, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="1515">So he was drafted.</sentence><sentence id="1516">And the funny thing is my parents wanted to stay in <span

that.</sentence><sentence id="1521">So lo and behold, we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1522">But once I got here, I had gotten used to it.</sentence><sentence id="1523">And my brother, once he came on a green card, was drafted.</sentence><sentence id="1524">So the -- but he was in basic training.</sentence><sentence id="1525">The -- the colonel -- you know, my parents worried about him.</sentence><sentence id="1526">I worried about him, too.</sentence><sentence id="1527">Because, you know, in the basic training in the Army is a

think he knew how to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1529">He's very smart and would become a very successful man, but these things are a skill unto itself.</sentence><sentence id="1530">So the

on.</sentence><sentence id="1532">I want to learn French."</sentence><sentence id="1533">So he eventually was sent to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1534">And I don't know if the colonel went, I

him.</sentence><sentence id="1573">Very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1574">It was all very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1575">He was a nice guy.</sentence><sentence id="1576">But the -- the -- I was a star for the neighbors, because it was -- people were frightened.</sentence><sentence id="1577">They had lived through the war and -- and this was a strange sort of person, you know, and they just

degree.</sentence><sentence id="1717">So the -- I think you can be respected without being accepted.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And I think the Kleins were respected but -- accepted means you're just a regular guy, you're a regular woman.</sentence><sentence id="1719">That's acceptance.</sentence><sentence id="1720">If you are singled out for something that you had no choice about, or you had a choice about, that -- and people give you credit for that, that's not accepted.</sentence><sentence id="1721">That's respected.</sentence><sentence id="1722">But accepted is all the people.</sentence><sentence id="1723">So I -- I don't know if you see the distinction, but that's -- or you've ever noticed the distinction.</sentence><sentence id="1724">But I -- so I -- I didn't put it forth that I am -- when people say to me "Where are you from?"</sentence><sentence id="1725">Or you say more.</sentence><sentence id="1726">In fact, I was a college professor at one time, and some of the students didn't -- you know, like they don't know accents.</sentence><sentence id="1727">So they would say "Dr. Schafler, are you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?" {</sentence><sentence id="1728">Laughter} "Or where are you from?"</sentence><sentence id="1729">So, you know, I would say "Oh, I'm from some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1730">I didn't want to go</sentence><sentence id="1732">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 39</span> into it.</sentence><sentence id="1733">So the -- the -- I did not want to attract attention because of that.</sentence><sentence id="1734">So, but I don't think that Jews were as forthcoming as all that.</sentence><sentence id="1735">They were not forthcoming in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And -- and the more you -- you look around, there were a lot of Jewish profiteers.</sentence><sentence id="1737">I mean like -- like Mr. Jacobs was a profiteer in the sense that he earned money and he lived better and earned himself positions.</sentence><sentence id="1738">And I was reading a book not long ago about the Wrightmans.</sentence><sentence id="1739">I don't know if the family name strikes you, but the Wrightmans are billionaire developers.</sentence><sentence id="1740">They have developed half of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> or three-quarters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">And they are Hungarian Jews, and they bought their way out when -- when <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was going -- they bought their way out and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tangier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1742">So they -- so that they wouldn't be considered profiteers.</sentence><sentence id="1743">Oh, and they went into money laundering.</sentence><sentence id="1744">That's profiteering.</sentence><sentence id="1745">And there was so much money.</sentence><sentence id="1746">There was no place to launder money other than in offshore.</sentence><sentence id="1747">So they became very, very wealthy.</sentence><sentence id="1748">So for -- for people that don't know, they said she -- that Mrs. Wrightman had a group of women and they were wrapping packages to send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1749">Now, that is the stupid -- the second stupidist thing I've ever heard.</sentence><sentence id="1750">I can't think of the first.</sentence><sentence id="1751">The idea that you can send packages to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they have mail call, and they say "Schmul Kahn(ph), there is a package for you."</sentence><sentence id="1752">Are you kidding?</sentence><sentence id="1753">So they -- and -- or -- or that the Nazis would have allowed packages to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or even Cariera de Piatra.</sentence><sentence id="1754">That is too stupid.</sentence><sentence id="1755">Oh, and -- and she -- they write -- probably self-written.</sentence><sentence id="1756">I don't recall who wrote it.</sentence><sentence id="1757">But they write that they -- they had difficulty sending them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">They have to send them through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1759">And the packages had chocolate, coffee.</sentence><sentence id="1760">Now, come on, give me a break.</sentence><sentence id="1761">How ridiculous can you be?</sentence><sentence id="1762">So the --</sentence><sentence id="1764">Interview with Pepi Schafler 40 the -- they had dehumanized.</sentence><sentence id="1765">They dehumanized the experience.</sentence><sentence id="1766">If you think that -- that you can launder money for Nazis but you're sending chocolate -- chocolate to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> somewhere, how dare you.</sentence><sentence id="1767">So Jews did not -- did not do much, did not do much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1856">Q:When did you become interested in researching your own story and really piecing together your family history?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1858">A:l -- I didn't -- I mean I know -- I knew some of it, you know, as I -- as I went along.</sentence><sentence id="1859">I - - the -- the Schafler side

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1861">I said, "I don't know."</sentence><sentence id="1862">And he showed me a picture, and he looked exactly like all the

id="1865">They all look alike, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1866">So I said well, this guy must be related to me because he looks like my dad.</sentence><sentence id="1867">So anyway, he says, "Well, I'll -- I'll -- he died, but I'll contact his widow."</sentence><sentence id="1868">And he contacted this widow, and she -- she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> at the time, and she had -- but they had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> before, and then he been a rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> as well, and she had seven

and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="1870">And she started researching the Schafler family, and she sent me -- she would keep me posted, and she would send me all kinds of stuff about it, and she'd send me -- she'd send me like a matrix outlining who went where and who did what.</sentence><sentence id="1871">But then one day she called me and told me that she's not gonna do -- and she had gone

-- I don't know very much beyond that.</sentence><sentence id="1883">But what have come to me, what I have -- I never thought much about it, many -- for many years, I ignored the -- it's been too painful to evaluate the Jewish contribution to the Holocaust and to the people that suffered.</sentence><sentence id="1884">It's been too painful.</sentence><sentence id="1885">But I have come to understand -- I don't understand it.</sentence><sentence id="1886">I just notice it.</sentence><sentence id="1887">The Jewish people had been conditioned by religion that, you know, do what you're told to do by authority.</sentence><sentence id="1888">No way could -- could ten Nazis with ten guns shoot 6,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="1889">No way.</sentence><sentence id="1890">So if they would have shot 200 people, 300 people, fully 5,700 or 4,700, whatever the math is, would have been alive, and -- and they offered no resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1891">My grandfather said

later.</sentence><sentence id="1917">And after Yevtushenko's poem, I wanted to go to -- to see it.</sentence><sentence id="1918">Because we -- we had so many birthdates, my parents -- when my parents were alive, they were very worried about that, that -- that somebody will find out.</sentence><sentence id="1919">They had been intimidated by -- by Nazis and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And -- and they -- they had trouble coping with me because -- and so had my brother, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1921">And the interesting part is that he -- he had high security when he worked

{Coughs}.</sentence><sentence id="1928">But -- but I didn't want to worry them, like why would I -- and I -- my -- so | -- I tell people when I was born, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1929">And it does not coincide with the - - with my documents.</sentence><sentence id="1930">So my parents knew that I am doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1931">Now, I married the second

I did not do that.</sentence><sentence id="1948">But after they died, I did, and that's what took me -- you know, nobody cares, I don't think they cared, but my parents cared.</sentence><sentence id="1949">And -- and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="30.523">Kiev</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1950">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> has now the -- the City of Kiev had grown around it, so it's now just a -- like a <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1951">This is a <span

and {Coughs} -- I -- I didn't think for a second that -- that it was -- had anything to do with -- with the false papers they got out of the Soviet occupied.</sentence><sentence id="1953">But at the same time, a little bit, you think about it.</sentence><sentence id="1954">So that -- that fear is {Coughs} -- and I have my driver's license -- my driver's license, if you were to take our driver's licenses, my brother's and me were twins.</sentence><sentence id="1955">So my brother never told his wife.</sentence><sentence id="1956">He had been married for 27 years to this -- this woman, and he never told her about that.</sentence><sentence id="1957">So earlier this year, I went to <span class="REGION">California</span> and she had -- she had made some reservation for me, and she says, "Well, give me your -- your birthdate as it's written on the -- on your driver's license."</sentence><sentence id="1958">So I told her.</sentence><sentence id="1959">She said, "Oh, my God, that's my brother -- my husband's."</sentence><sentence id="1960">I said, "You're right, it is."</sentence><sentence id="1961">So you can change it and it doesn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1962">It doesn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1963">But the fear is there and, you know, when I would say "Mom, where are</sentence><sentence id="1965">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler

me?"</sentence><sentence id="1969">And maybe I'd like it if they do.</sentence><sentence id="1970">So the -- the fear.</sentence><sentence id="1971">And -- and I think there is a Jewish fear.</sentence><sentence id="1972">There is a inherent fear.</sentence><sentence id="1973">Maybe -- maybe it's just the generation that experienced Naziism.</sentence><sentence id="1974">Maybe it's still -- although the Jewish paper, somebody sent me this article from the -- the D.C. Jewish paper that it said Jews have no opinion about some political thing.</sentence><sentence id="1975">Like why should they have an opinion?</sentence><sentence id="1976">I mean Americans should have an opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1977">Why should they have an opinion?</sentence><sentence id="1978">So maybe -- maybe it's not as homogenized yet as I think, that that fear has -- has been left.</sentence><sentence id="1979">But then Jews don't speak out about -- about Jewish slight.</sentence><sentence id="1980">Jews were silent in the "30s.</sentence><sentence id="1981">Business was good, especially in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1982">It was after the Depression.</sentence><sentence id="1983">And they were selling arms, and they didn't want to rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1984">So they were silent.</sentence><sentence id="1985">I mean having a demonstration in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> is not enough, so -- but this has come to me later.</sentence><sentence id="1986">When I married my first husband, he -- he was a staunch -- talked about Roosevelt, his whole family.</sentence><sentence id="1987">And Roosevelt sat with his lover he had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1988">You know, you probably heard that he had on the corner, like the second corner of <span class="DLF">Connecticut Avenue</span>, there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and he used to go there every afternoon to meet his lover.</sentence><sentence id="1989">And -- and Jews didn't -- were not an issue.</sentence><sentence id="1990">Jewish blood being wasted was not an issue.</sentence><sentence id="1991">So that had come to me later when I -- when I started looking at it.</sentence><sentence id="1992">And for me that's what I like about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1993">They're pugnacious and they -- they -- in a way they are like a four- year-old who's pugnacious but dependent at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="1994"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is dependent on the <span class="REGION">Western World</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1995">But at the same time, they're pugnacious, and they -- "Hey, I don't like</sentence><sentence id="1997">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 45</span> this crap, yeah?</sentence><sentence id="1998">I don't -- I'm not gonna take this."</sentence><sentence id="1999">So -- but that has come to me much later.</sentence><sentence id="2000">The fear of being Jewish has -- had persisted for a while.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2102">A: Well, first of all, because I -- I no longer feel constraint by -- by my constraints.</sentence><sentence id="2103">As I mentioned to you, when -- when the man spoke, and you can probably look it up in the -- who he was and -- look it up in the calendars, you know, I thought I'm not doing that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2104">I'm not looking at -- and, you know, all the people in <span class="REGION">California</span>, I didn't want to have anything to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="2105">But -- but I -- maybe it's an empowerment.</sentence><sentence id="2106">I have empowered myself.</sentence><sentence id="2107">This happened to -- to me despite what I thought, despite me being innocent, and now I can tell you about it and you didn't help me.</sentence><sentence id="2108">You did nothing about it.</sentence><sentence id="2109">The -- the people that we thought were -- we were helped by the people that we thought were victimizing us.</sentence><sentence id="2110">The camp commander who hid, who said, "I saved as many of you as I could", and he didn't steal the money, he didn't -- he didn't bribe himself.</sentence><sentence id="2111">He had the opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And -- and the -- and Misha and the -- we never -- didn't know his name, the round guy, is {Coughs} that used to give us food and say "Don't worry about that, just hang in."</sentence><sentence id="2113">Just -- just -- or some days when there was a lot of shooting, he'd say, "Today is not a good day you should look out", you know, or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2114">But he'd come by almost every day.</sentence><sentence id="2115">I can't remember a day that he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2116">So these are the people that helped us that we thought were our -- our enemies, our -- that betrayed us.</sentence><sentence id="2117">They didn't betray us.</sentence><sentence id="2118">They did what they could to survive themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2119">And in a way -- in the -- on the way of helping themselves, they helped others.</sentence><sentence id="2120">This is a huge risk for the</sentence><sentence id="2122">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 46 camp

"Oh, there's nothing there, just old stuff."</sentence><sentence id="2125">So this is why I -- I feel empowered now.</sentence><sentence id="2126">I got it.</sentence><sentence id="2127">What I didn't get before, I got itnow.</sentence><sentence id="2128">And I think it's a -- it's a moving story to tell.</sentence><sentence id="2129">It's -- it's -- this kid that didn't have any schooling went on

id="2166">So now | -- I feel no -- no constraints.</sentence><sentence id="2167">I -- if I'm not accepted, I don't care.</sentence><sentence id="2168">I mean I might be respected, but I don't know that any -- any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims are accepted.</sentence><sentence id="2169">I don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="2170">I have not seen any evidence of that.</sentence><sentence id="2171">I think that even those that have reached fame or wealth are sort of more like the circus entertainer than just -- just an ordinary person.</sentence><sentence id="2172">But that's my own view of that.</sentence><sentence id="2173">Elie Wiesel is somebody who comes to mind.</sentence><sentence id="2174">I mean he's not -- he's admired but he's not -- and respected but he's not accepted, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2175">I mean he's not a regular guy, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2176">To -- to be accepted, you have to -- you can be respected and be a regular guy, and he's not respected as a regular guy.</sentence><sentence id="2177">So -- but I don't care now, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2178">I have accomplished a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2179">And those that don't want to accept me, go away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2260">Q:Is there anything else you would like to add that we haven't discussed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2262">A: -- nothing that, you know, I haven't -- I'm trying to think what I wanted to tell about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> story that I omitted.</sentence><sentence id="2263">That to -- to illustrate the accept -- I felt as a child the acceptance versus the kindness.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And as I told you before -- and I think you may want to - - to make a point of that, that -- I told you that the Bacalls were not there when we were, and there were the Finklesteins.</sentence><sentence id="2265">They -- they accepted us, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2266">They -- they didn't do their duty to -- to some unknown whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2267">They accepted us.</sentence><sentence id="2268">We were children, and they -- we were special.</sentence><sentence id="2269">And the way they treated us, you know, sort of -- we were dirty, I'm sure we were, and they -- they put us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and they cleaned our clothes and</sentence><sentence id="2271">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisentecion Interview with Pepi Schafler 48 they watched us sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2272">That's acceptance.</sentence><sentence id="2273">And -- and -- and they were poor but they fought for us, to keep us.</sentence><sentence id="2274">They were not poor -- I mean poor, I'm using it in relation to -- but they were not wealthy.</sentence><sentence id="2275">And two more mouths to feed, I don't know that it was easy.</sentence><sentence id="2276">But they were -- they were -- they wanted to share because they -- they accepted us.</sentence><sentence id="2277">So not a big -- the Bacalls were wonderful and all their friends.</sentence><sentence id="2278">They had parties and physician there, and he used to examine us and he was their close friend.</sentence><sentence id="2279">And they were wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2280">But then they were rich.</sentence><sentence id="2281">And the maid did most of it, and the chauffeur did the rest of it, so they -- it's easier kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2282">It was not -- they -- I don't think they accepted us.</sentence><sentence id="2283">They sort of a "noblesse oblige", if you know anything in French, that so -- that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2284">And I think that -- that the acceptance for minorities in general is just not what it should be.</sentence><sentence id="2285">It should -- just not what it should be.</sentence><sentence id="2286">I mean when -- when I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I thought being Jewish, being a Holocaust survivor, is like being, you know, a toddler, you grow up and you move on, but it isn't.</sentence><sentence id="2287">Nobody -- you're not treated like that.</sentence><sentence id="2288">So therefore, you internalize that you're not treated like that.</sentence><sentence id="2289">We also thought that, you know, we -- we fought for the "60s and all the marches and stuff and we thought well, equality for -- for African-Americans, for black people would come.</sentence><sentence id="2290">And then you would just think well, this is another woman and she's great or she's awful or just another guy and he's great or he's -- didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="2291">It didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="2292">The -- so this is one of the reasons that I decided now to -- she's the one that is the survivor.</sentence><sentence id="2293">I mean when -- when -- when Madoffs, the people that gave the money, you know -- you know, we all -- you probably know, you saw the list, I'm sure you saw the list, you -- you think -- you thought to yourself how could people that have that much money be so stupid?</sentence><sentence id="2294">How</sentence><sentence id="2296">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 49</span> could they not know what goes on?</sentence><sentence id="2297">How could they not know that -- that when everybody else pays 3 percent and somebody pays 10 percent that is illegal or -- or fraud.</sentence><sentence id="2298">But people looked at Wiesel, especially, Elie Wiesel, and thought how could he do that?I'm sure you know he lost a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="2299">And he said he didn't want to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="2300">He feels that.</sentence><sentence id="2301">He feels that his -- his -- his burden is -- is higher than someone else's burden.</sentence><sentence id="2302">You know, somebody else had lost that much money.</sentence><sentence id="2303">A lot of people spoke out.</sentence><sentence id="2304">He never spoke out, because he feels that -- that he's not accepted, and for him would just be another piece of evidence not to accept him.</sentence><sentence id="2305">No, another reason not to accept him.</sentence><sentence id="2306">I had -- [had wonderful childhood, you know, wonderful childhood.</sentence><sentence id="2307">That's not true.</sentence><sentence id="2308">I had wonderful childhood until -- until -- but I had like Ruth, I had very good parents, wonderful parents, although they were more conservative and fearful as they got older and fearful because of what they went through.</sentence><sentence id="2309">They were -- they were just -- we were their priority, and if we -- they didn't give us food when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was because there was none.</sentence><sentence id="2310">And we didn't have to ask and say "How come we're not eating?"</sentence><sentence id="2311">If it would have been possible to get food, they would have gotten it.</sentence><sentence id="2312">So -- so this kind of total devotion.</sentence><sentence id="2313">And I remember my -- when we came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Botoshan</span> and we were walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we saw my dad come walking, {Coughs} coming towards us, and he hugged me and he said, "You came back to your poor old father."</sentence><sentence id="2314">And I'm thinking to myself how could he doubt it?</sentence><sentence id="2315">How could he doubt that we would come back?</sentence><sentence id="2316">You would make a choice you left luxury and you came to your poor -- poor old, poor father.</sentence><sentence id="2317">How could he doubt that?</sentence><sentence id="2318">That he -- they were very loving kind of -- if not dad -- my dad was more affectionate than my mother, but both of them had the priorities</sentence><sentence id="2320">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Pepi Schafler 50</span> taking care of the children.</sentence><sentence id="2321">So -- so this -- this kind of thing gives you a basis.</sentence><sentence id="2322">I didn't have to worry about that they would not protect my interests.</sentence><sentence id="2323">So -- so you take this basis with you into life, this early -- or this -- this approval, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2324">I had come to -- to -- to -- when you go through marriages and stuff like that, and you realize that only good parents love you.</sentence><sentence id="2325">Everybody else has a motive, wants you to love them back, wants to be married to you, uh, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2326">But only loving parents love you because they -- they wanted to have children and they -- they -- they feel the responsibility to do the best by you.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And when they led us -- they sent us away, they wanted us to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2328">If they couldn't assure their survival, they wanted someone else to -- they wanted us to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2329">So anyway -- yeah, I can think of -- the woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruth</span>, she -- she talks about -- I don't know if you are familiar with the book, but she talks about hers was a more modest.</sentence><sentence id="2330">They were sort of hand to mouth kind of people.</sentence><sentence id="2331">And so any -- any bit of deviancy in life affected them immediately {Coughs).</sentence><sentence id="2332">So different experiences may have made her different -- her attitude different.</sentence><sentence id="2333">That's all I have to say.</sentence><sentence id="2334">Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time.</sentence><sentence id="2335">Conclusion of Interview</sentence></p></dialogue>
