class="BUILDING">black market</span> like to have food and things, and my parents did everything.</sentence><sentence id="178">We did not feel...oh, I remember my mother was afraid for me because she remembered the Kosacks (ph), you know, raping, and I was going on...let's see...1 was going on fourteen and she was afraid for me, but the the Germans...someone asked me just not long ago if the Germans did anything like to rape a woman.</sentence><sentence id="179">Germans, and I'm talking Liege...probably the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, I'm not sure...were not allowed to approach a civilian on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">They had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, <span class="BUILDING">prostitution homes</span>, reserved for soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="181">They never never touched anyone on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and I think, if I remember, this was done for propaganda purposes to show how good the Germans were, that they were not our enemies, but they never never touched a woman.</sentence><sentence id="182"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had food.</sentence><sentence id="183">Anything we had...coffee, we used to roast coffee after four years of war, and we had to close the <span class="DLF">windows</span> because the coffee smelled when you roasted it.</sentence><sentence id="184">We had rice...everything found its way on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">My father, before we went into hiding, used to get on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and go and get, you know, the carp is not the same as the American carp.</sentence><sentence id="186">It's clean.</sentence><sentence id="187">And he would sell that on the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> because that was not rationed.</sentence><sentence id="188">They would...he would go to the farmers and sometimes like bring eggs because that was highly rationed.</sentence><sentence id="189">Now the farmers had quotas to turn in depending on the size of their <span class="DLF">farms</span>, whether it was butter or eggs, so what they used to do is they used to be quote, robbed.</sentence><sentence id="190">Somebody came during the night or early in the morning and they were robbed, and all of that found its way on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, so as far as where we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, we had food.</sentence><sentence id="191">We never went hungry.</sentence><sentence id="192">Never.</sentence><sentence id="193">Clothing...it's not the way of life here.</sentence><sentence id="194">You know, you bought a dress and you wore it until you outgrew it and then it went down to your younger sister and it was passed down.</sentence><sentence id="195">My my mother had been a man's tailor, so whatever pieces of fabric were left around, we managed to scrounge, and we wore the same things over</sentence><sentence id="197">and over, but we had clothes and for money you could buy and it's hard to explain.</sentence><sentence id="198">My parents were honest people but anyone who understands war situation knows that if you want to survive in an occupied country, you do <span class="BUILDING">black markets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">In other words, there were ration stamps.</sentence><sentence id="200">I was...never had money floating in my hands as much as...that's before we went into hiding...this is the first two years of war.</sentence><sentence id="201">The ration stamps were like like postage stamps and they used to make false ones.</sentence><sentence id="202">They used to duplicate them, like making fake money and it used to find its way on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, and that's what my father did and I don't know where he got his...he did not produce them.</sentence><sentence id="203">I don't who produced them, but we...my father used to buy them, get them and sell them and make money that way, and then wherever you could get either farm produce or I don't remember meat but I remember distinctly fish and eggs, whatever, and especially the stamps so I was old enough that if a customer came and wanted stamps, you see, and you could tell they were fake.</sentence><sentence id="204">But remember that the civilian...1 mean Germans did not occupy everything and besides...they called them Alexis (ph) patrol Germans...they were all...everybody had to because you had a pad of butter a month as a ration.</sentence><sentence id="205">I learned to drink coffee without sugar for that reason, because my mother saved it to make jellies and things and to this day I don't drink coffee with sugar for for that reason, but anything you wanted except bananas.</sentence><sentence id="206">Fresh fruit, because <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium Congo</span> and you could find on <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">So we ate and there was uh, you know, I I remember the first German.</sentence><sentence id="208">We were petrified of them, you know, but the Germans were not all over.</sentence><sentence id="209">The <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was run by Belgium civilians, so you didn't even see them that much.</sentence><sentence id="210">It's just that we had a uh a concern (ph) very close by with...a <span class="DLF">block</span>, a block and a half of where I lived, so you did see more of the soldiers than maybe if you lived in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the concern (ph) was not close by, but otherwise it was all run and all occupied by by civilians, by by the Belgiums, so the first two years uh there was noth...I did not...if I think back, besides seeing the first Germans and clinging to my mother, uh you know, you saw them coming with their rifles and as much as we could still comprehend uh once we got going I did not feel...there was no persecution.</sentence><sentence id="211">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="212">We continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so there was nothing to make us feel...] think my parents sort of protected us to to to what really could be.</sentence><sentence id="213">I don't know, but the brunt of it was on my parents because they had gone through World War I with the, you know, the Kosacks and they remembered but we didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1099">A: When they were arrested?</sentence><sentence id="1100">May 5, 1944, five o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1101">The Gestapo came to pick up the family, and remember this...on March...March 5, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="1102">March 5 at five o'clock in the morning, and you have to remember the weather...wee hours in the morning and it's dark, and they took them from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> to question them and my mother tried to save the children by telling them that they were not her children.</sentence><sentence id="1103">But the Germans did not take it, and the farmers tried.</sentence><sentence id="1104">I don't know to what extent, and the Germans did not take it and I guess no one asked for me.</sentence><sentence id="1105">Whoever reported us didn't realize that I was missing but they did ask where my father was and my little sister said my father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the German slapped her for lying.</sentence><sentence id="1106">In this case the farmers who did not specifically do something physical for us like making the papers or something, but they knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1107">We had food.</sentence><sentence id="1108">We had eggs.</sentence><sentence id="1109">We had milk.</sentence><sentence id="1110">We had everything we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1111">My father worked for it, but uh nobody paid for us you see.</sentence><sentence id="1112">I mean there was no exchanges, you know, wherever... don't know where we got the meat.</sentence><sentence id="1113">I remember a ham, a smoked ham, and my mother never touched it.</sentence><sentence id="1114">I mean my mother could not get away from the kosher laws even though the meat she ate was not kosher.</sentence><sentence id="1115">The farmers were there to notify us.</sentence><sentence id="1116">Why they didn't know...they came at five o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1117">If they would have known I can assure you we would have been warned, but this was March 5.</sentence><sentence id="1118">Remember D-Day was June 6th.</sentence><sentence id="1119">The Allied troops were getting ready for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">There was heavy bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Hitler was fighting on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> where all the Ger...they needed the soldiers on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>, so you had the Catholic citizen, the Belgium citizen, in hiding because they didn't want to go to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and it's hard to comprehend.</sentence><sentence id="1122">How do you hide in your own <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but everybody was hiding, and as a whole, whoever had to send the letters out to say yes we have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and you have to report because you have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, these people were against the Germans too, so if you had where where...I don't know what the percentage was, but there were not many.</sentence><sentence id="1123">All you needed is one or two and they had to be careful that the underground didn't kill them because the Catholics were German-haters enough to do it because I know they did it whoever caught.</sentence><sentence id="1124">As a matter of fact, when the Jews came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> did not own property, did not own <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1125">For some reason there was a couple...and we were not friends of theirs...owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1126">The family, a boy, girl, mother and father, were deported.</sentence><sentence id="1127">The girl and the boy came back.</sentence><sentence id="1128">They were around my age...I don't remember...they were one of the first ones to come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1129">The had</sentence><sentence id="1131">7 occupied their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1132">Do you know what happened when they came back?</sentence><sentence id="1133">People went in and had a bonfire throwing them out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1134">So the fear we had was the fear of being caught and being caught in a cluster, which had happ...which happened.</sentence><sentence id="1135">You see, if my sister hadn't been sick, she too would have survived.</sentence><sentence id="1136">Uh we were also afraid of another Jew because you...the list, the names of the Jews and I'm talking strictly Liege, that it got out, was handed out, was prepared by a Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="1137">They ended up in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1138">As a matter of fact, they had two daughters, one my age and one a little bit older.</sentence><sentence id="1139">They ended up in hiding and you know, people under certain circumstances do certain things to save their life.</sentence><sentence id="1140">I think it's well known that certain people did things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, that it went on at top levels in trying to save their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1141">This not unknown.</sentence><sentence id="1142">It's not uh surfaced as much as what we went though, but there was a Jewish couple...I can't think of their name.</sentence><sentence id="1143">Only the daughter's name I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1144">After the war, they were shunned.</sentence><sentence id="1145">The older daughter ended up going with an American who was not Jewish...he was Protestant...someplace in <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="1146">She was pregnant before she was married.</sentence><sentence id="1147">Now we're going back to the days when when this happened it was the worst thing that could happen.</sentence><sentence id="1148">Everybody says he deserves it.</sentence><sentence id="1149">So you were also concerned of what another Jew might do in order to save his... think when everybody went into hiding, every one realized no one could save themselves no matter what they did, so this this man who who who did this, ended up in hiding like everybody else, but he was...they were separated from the girls.</sentence><sentence id="1150">The girls ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1151">What you also had...my parents, my mother was a very good person, very soft-hearted, and this is how this couple, Rochelle and her husband and the baby, came in hiding with us, because we wanted to help them but it would have been much smarter if we didn't, if...we should have been more selfish so you didn't have as large a cluster of people together, but my parents knew her when she was what, fifteen, sixteen, and he was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">They knew him as a youngster, so they did for them and we went in together, but as a whole, Jews did not...I think my father ran into the man who had given out the list because you know you walked the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and he knew the two girls were in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic home</span> and he wouldn't tell my father where because he didn't want...you see, he was smart ina way.</sentence><sentence id="1153">He didn't want other Jews to find out because the more you had, the more dangerous it was for them.</sentence><sentence id="1154">So the idea was to do the best you could for yourself, but not do for another one, not to be caught in a cluster, but we were in a cluster no matter how we tried.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And uh Rochelle and...they came...I don't know how much later.</sentence><sentence id="1156">It was it was not a month because after the the teenagers were, you know, had to go out and no one, no one that I know of in that group came back.</sentence><sentence id="1157">This was right at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1158">They came...it might have been a week later, ten days later, that they called them in, so they came and joined us and we were two families together which was not good so what happens when the Gestapo came, everybody was together.</sentence><sentence id="1159">Why Rochelle and her husband never tried to go someplace else...I guess we felt very well- protected because there was no anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Nobody turned in anyone you see.</sentence><sentence id="1161">No one turned in anyone, except the _ because they were underground people that were being picked up and they were trying to find out who was doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1162">Sure they found out.</sentence><sentence id="1163">Sunday...my family.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Thursday the twin brothers who were supposed to have gone up to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1165">Not only that, I think they were working with the underground, and then that...when it was found out that there were things going on uh before and they were trying to find out who was selling out, what was going... don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

could be reversed.</sentence><sentence id="1328">She remarried, but she cannot have children.</sentence><sentence id="1329">She could not, you know, she could not have children.</sentence><sentence id="1330">And what I remember at liberation is when the Jews came back, this whole thing...we were hoping my mother would come back, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1331">And then at first, you know,
