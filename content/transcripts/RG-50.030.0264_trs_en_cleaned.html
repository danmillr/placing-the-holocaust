that our papers had "Protestant," they excused themselves for waking us up.</sentence><sentence id="478">As long as I live, I will never forget the screams of the Jewish people who were taken out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="479">This <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="480">It had a

id="485">We were spared because we were Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="486">Now we had heard that the Germans were trying to march into the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we were trying to march into the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="487">And we were trying to go to <span

on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">You cannot go that way."</sentence><sentence id="498">So we went back to the Dutch Consul.</sentence><sentence

myself.</sentence><sentence id="502">They would not give it to my brother-in-law because Hitler had made a pact with with Franco that no military age person would go through because they knew they would join the Allied Armies.</sentence><sentence id="503">So my brother-in-law couldn't get it.</sentence><sentence id="504">We tried and tried and tried.</sentence><sentence id="505">They wouldn't give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="506">I tried my best.</sentence><sentence id="507">I flirted with these Spanish people in that consultate which my mother had told me to do...and I did...but it was to no avail.</sentence><sentence id="508">We even tried to change my brother-in-law's age on his passport with some ink iradicator, but it was so bad it made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the paper.</sentence><sentence id="509">It was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="510">We didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="511">My brother-in-law stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">My mother kept calling and said, "You must come.</sentence><sentence id="513">We have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="514">The Germans are about to march in."</sentence><sentence id="515">My mother, my younger sister and I, we went to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Papinvon</span> and we...I left my brother-in-law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">My mother had left my brother-in-law quite a bit of money to see if he couldn't buy himself a transit visa.</sentence><sentence id="518">When we arrived across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, there was a lot of cheering and I think it was November the 10, 1942, when we arrived across the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">And all the Spainards were cheering.</sentence><sentence id="520">And there was a Dutch representative from the consulate of Madrid at this <span class="BUILDING">station</span> who apparently came and met many of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to see if there were any Dutch people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="521">And I asked him...1 couldn't understand Spanish...and I asked him why are they all cheering.</sentence><sentence id="522">The <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> said, "Don't you know.</sentence><sentence id="523">This is the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that is coming out of the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">The...the Germans have invaded and taken over the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>."</sentence><sentence id="525">So, of course, we felt good that we were out, but my brother-in-law was stilll back there.</sentence><sentence id="526">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>, and my sister...my oldest sister was at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="527">She had preceded us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> because my mother thought maybe she could do something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> to get her husband a transit visa.</sentence><sentence id="528">I said to my sister, "How did you know that we were here, that we were on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="529">And she said, "I know I have met every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that came from the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and I am so happy to see you because I know I will never see Bob again."</sentence><sentence id="530">Now about that evening, we received a phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> received a phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span> that my brother-in-law had made it safely out.</sentence><sentence id="531">The Germans marched into</sentence><sentence id="533">the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> on May the 8th, and they came...they came from the north and they marched down through the south.</sentence><sentence id="534">By the time they had...they hadn't reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> yet, but they were well on the way.</sentence><sentence id="535">My brother-in-law went back to the Spanish consul and said, "Look.</sentence><sentence id="536">The Germans are about here.</sentence><sentence id="537">Why don't you give me a visa and I give you all this money."</sentence><sentence id="538">And they took it.</sentence><sentence id="539">And he couldn't get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out any more to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">He made it to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> and he walked a lot of pyranees...there was a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>, and somehow from there, he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barcelona</span>.</sentence><sentence id="541">Going without a visa woud have been the same as death because in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> they put all the people who did not have a transit visa or a visa, they put them in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="542">We knew of one that was called Miranda and the situation was so bad that few people survived that camp.</sentence><sentence id="543">They did not give them any food.</sentence><sentence id="544">They...the people were dirty.</sentence><sentence id="545">It was the worst and worse situation.</sentence><sentence id="546">As a matter of fact, there were two friends of my parents who had landed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and who had never come out.</sentence><sentence id="547">Now we stayed about 4 days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> where the Dutch government in...Dutch government was in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at the time and they had arranged for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to pick all the Dutch people up and bring them to <span class="REGION">Dutch Guyana Surinam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> for few weeks, and we were about 75 Dutch people.</sentence><sentence id="549">We were put on this neutral <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portugese ship</span> and we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surinam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="550">It was...I think it was something like a 3 week journey.</sentence><sentence id="551">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was only that because it was a neutral <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="552">We passed all the dark <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> that were they were either <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ships</span> or and they were black...black out.</sentence><sentence id="553">About a day and a half before we got to the <span
