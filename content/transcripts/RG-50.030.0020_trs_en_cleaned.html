<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: My name is David Bergman, spelled B-E-R-G-M-A-N. And I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian Mountains</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochov</span>."</sentence><sentence id="8">It... at that time when I was born, it belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">Was a province of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">And I was born on May 3rd, 1931.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="16">Can you give us some of your recollections of your early childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Well, the early childhood was a very happy life for me and my family.</sentence><sentence id="20">I had a younger brother, older sister, mother, father, grandparents; and we were very close knit family.</sentence><sentence id="21">My father was a tailor.</sentence><sentence id="22">And uh...he made suits for people coming from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">We had one of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">tailor shops</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">And my mother, who was a seamstress, made the shirts.</sentence><sentence id="25">And I was just busy running around having a good time.</sentence><sentence id="26">And that we had uh what's considered here...it's a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">We had...uh we didn't, I should say, have the comforts like in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">We didn't have running water.</sentence><sentence id="29">We didn't have...uh central heating.</sentence><sentence id="30">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> from heating, for heating; and uh for the water, we had a <span class="DLF">well</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">And the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> was in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> several hundred feet.</sentence><sentence id="32">So I...where I lived, I considered that normal.(Laughing) I didn't think that you're supposed to have these kind of conveniences.</sentence><sentence id="33">So we didn't uh...uh think that there should be any other way.</sentence><sentence id="34">And uh...my...uh I went both to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> and <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">Now uh actually when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was really...is when the first uh--say in "39--the first sensing of the beginning of what anti-Semitism is really like.</sentence><sentence id="36">And I remember, it was on a Saturday once.</sentence><sentence id="37">And that's after the Hungarians marched in.</sentence><sentence id="38">The Hungarians, until 1939 that <span class="REGION">province</span> was under Czechoslovakia rule.</sentence><sentence id="39">And we had a Czech officer.</sentence><sentence id="40">We had a two-family <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; he lived on the lower <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">And all of a sudden, he disappeared just like that.</sentence><sentence id="42">Just like over night.</sentence><sentence id="43">And the Hungarians just marched in.</sentence><sentence id="44">And we were forced to...uh pledge allegiance to the new Hungarian regime.</sentence><sentence id="45">And as soon as they walked in, within a few days...I happened to be on a Saturday at my grandfather's <span class="NPIP">place</span>; and he had a eruv.</sentence><sentence id="46">I don't know if you know; a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">eruv</span> is a <span class="DLF">guide wire</span> that sets a <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> as far as we can walk on the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="47">And the first thing they did is, they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and ripped off that <span class="DLF">wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">So that was the first harassment that I actually seen by the Hungarian Nazis--showing their muscles, really, what they can do.</sentence><sentence id="49">And then afterwards, we were told that we could no longer go into " Czech: Veliky-Bo_kov, or Russ: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Velikiye-Bychkov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">Located in the <span class="REGION">Transcarpathian Oblast</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">cheder, legally.</sentence><sentence id="52">That was forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="53">So we had to go illegally.</sentence><sentence id="54">And then we would have a look out for the police.</sentence><sentence id="55">So we'd take turns.</sentence><sentence id="56">Whenever the police came, they always were in pair.</sentence><sentence id="57">They had their green hats and a little feather on their head like, so they were recognizable from a distance.</sentence><sentence id="58">So as soon as they...we saw them coming, we get a signal-- "Disperse!"</sentence><sentence id="59">And we would run; and "til it was all clear.</sentence><sentence id="60">And then we would resume again.</sentence><sentence id="61">And we sort of accepted that that's a way of life.</sentence><sentence id="62">We didn't question the parents who they were, why they're doing it.</sentence><sentence id="63">That's the way it is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: This was in 1939?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: And then what do you remember immediately after that?</sentence><sentence id="118">Let's say in the..."40, early "40s.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Well, then afterwards it started to...for...tightened, I guess use the word "tighten" the noose more.</sentence><sentence id="122">They next step they did is, they took the licenses away of people--professional--of practicing their business.</sentence><sentence id="123">Like I had a cousin who was a dentist, and he was not allowed to practice dentistry anymore.</sentence><sentence id="124">We were supposed... We were forced to go secretly.</sentence><sentence id="125">So that if I went to a dentist and I had work some done and my teeth were bleeding...gums were bleeding, then I had to wait--make sure that the bleeding stopped--before I would leave.</sentence><sentence id="126">Because if they would have caught me, seeing uh that I had dental care through a Jewish dentist, then they would have punished him and me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: How big a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> did you have there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: There were about 3,000 Jewish in that...and then about 7,000 Christians in that <span class="REGION">area</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="136">My father was allowed to keep the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, because for some reason that I can't remember--I was about 10 or 11 at the time--is because we had Czech citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="137">So they allowed those with Czech citizenship to keep the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">But those of Hungarian, they took away.</sentence><sentence id="139">Why?</sentence><sentence id="140">L..I..[ wasn't old enough there to understand.</sentence><sentence id="141">In fact, we were really such...lived in such an isolated <span class="REGION">area</span> that the news would come from a drummer.</sentence><sentence id="142">We have a drummer coming like old time and beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span>; and we would all run out toward the square.</sentence><sentence id="143">And then he would take out a piece of paper, and that's how we got our news.</sentence><sentence id="144">So we never really realized that anything can happen.</sentence><sentence id="145">I heard things--events--happening, but I could not relate to what was going around the world at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="158">So then what happen subsequently?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, afterwards...then my father was drafted into the Hungarian Army.</sentence><sentence id="160">And this was a very, very dramatic experience for us, having him away, because we were so close knit.</sentence><sentence id="161">And then he was uh gone for a year.</sentence><sentence id="162">And then they gave him a furlough.</sentence><sentence id="163">And while he was gone, because I was the oldest in the family I was considered man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">Uh, This was about 11.</sentence><sentence id="165">I had to go on night guard with an older person.</sentence><sentence id="166">And they gave us a stick in the hand.</sentence><sentence id="167">I had no idea what this was all about, but we had to walk around the <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> to looking in case some saboteurs would come.</sentence><sentence id="168">Uh, and uh I...I still wonder why should they take somebody my age.</sentence><sentence id="169">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="170">If somebody wanted to be a saboteur, do something, I'd run the other way.</sentence><sentence id="171">But you learned not to question.</sentence><sentence id="172">It was a sense...you sense that they have the power, and you have to obey and you have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="173">And then...uh later on, we continued...uh a life.</sentence><sentence id="174">We missed our father very much, and continued going secretly to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And then we saw deportations begin.</sentence><sentence id="176">They...they uh ...took certain people--let's say the Hungarian nationality--first.</sentence><sentence id="177">And I had no idea what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="178">My parents never really talked to me about what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="179">And all I saw is people marching away towards the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And this was yet "42, in that time.</sentence><sentence id="181">And uh...some reason, I think people really didn't talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="182">It was like a fear, or they didn't want to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I had no idea what was going on, and just accepted as it was.</sentence><sentence id="184">And then, they announced that our turn was going to come.</sentence><sentence id="185">And my father, being in the military, was given the choice.</sentence><sentence id="186">He could either stay in the army and save himself, or come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and be deported with us.</sentence><sentence id="187">So he chose to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with us.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="189">How old were you at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Twelve years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: So you were 12 years old.</sentence><sentence id="195">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="196">So your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then, and uh he decided he was going to go with you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Yah.</sentence><sentence id="201">I don't think he had any idea where we're being taken; because we were told that we are being taken to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, to...for him to work as a tailor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="205">And then what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well, the first inkling of what happened is, I recall it was in a Passover in "44.</sentence><sentence id="209">And it was a Pesach night; and we ...all of a sudden, we heard the knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And we were all frightened who it is, because we had the shutters down.</sentence><sentence id="211">And here was somebody talking with a German accent.</sentence><sentence id="212">And it was the German soldiers knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">They were not the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="214">They were the German soldiers retreating.</sentence><sentence id="215">And the strange thing was...about the whole thing is, that they come in... They were very polite in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="216">They asked if they could stay, because our <span class="INT_SPACE">downstairs</span> was vacant since the Czech officer had left.</sentence><sentence id="217">And they even offered to pay.</sentence><sentence id="218">And they put on a picture that "Hey, we're not as bad."</sentence><sentence id="219">And now I see why.</sentence><sentence id="220">They wanted to have confidence.</sentence><sentence id="221">They even put on some acrobatic things for the people, to show that they have come <span class="NPIP">within</span>...for good will.</sentence><sentence id="222">But once they got the confidence of the people, then they showed their true color.</sentence><sentence id="223">They came with guns afterwards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="241">David, was this in "43 or "44?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: "44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: This was in "44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: "44.</sentence><sentence id="249">And then, we...we were notified that we were going to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="250">And there was uh...Just been accepting for us; because we were very Orthodox, and this was the will of God.</sentence><sentence id="251">And uh...(Excuse me) God will protect us and God will shield us from them, and just put our faith in him.</sentence><sentence id="252">And uh...when it came to our turn, we were only allowed to carry in our possession with us what we could carry.</sentence><sentence id="253">And we got a...like a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> that we put our belongings, only what we could carry.</sentence><sentence id="254">And I can still remember that sight.</sentence><sentence id="255">This is in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="256">And after we loaded everything up and I looked at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>... And here, what the Hungarian Nazi's did, had the chutzpah to do on top of it--what they...what you call "insult to injury"--is that they gave my a father a signed document, right in front of him.</sentence><sentence id="257">They even put a seal on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">Stating that when we come back the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> will belong to us, that nobody else will take it over.</sentence><sentence id="259">And yet, when I look back, within me I had the feeling that it's never going to be the same again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: So you loaded your...your...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Personal belongings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: ...personal belongings on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cart</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">Yah, a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">It had a couple of wheels.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="286">And then what happened after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: After that, they uh marched us to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">And the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was like an assembly point, where what they would do is they would bring enough people until there was enough for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> load.</sentence><sentence id="291">And, for us, this was like electric shock.</sentence><sentence id="292">Whenever we heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> before, in...in 1942 and 1943, when they began... Uh, because we knew that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> are coming to pick up more people, take them away.</sentence><sentence id="293">So we already knew that going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">We didn't know what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="295">But soon as we got into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we were there, it is like being thrown into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">All of a sudden, they show their viciousness.</sentence><sentence id="297">Saw a couple of people passed out, and they beat them up; and we tried to help, and they wouldn't let and wouldn't offer any help.</sentence><sentence id="298">So we already sensed that something bad is going to happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="310">So you were in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="311">What happened after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: Well, after that we stayed there a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="316">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived; and then we were put onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">It was still a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>, instead of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">And uh...from there, I found they took us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mateszalka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mateszalka</span> was sort of a central point where they brought all the victims from all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetlach</span> around in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">And it's...,just like they brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetlach</span>, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> for all of the surrounding <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">So when they had enough people in there for a large...or whenever a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was available, then that's where uh was the assembling point.</sentence><sentence id="322">And that was...uh we lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="323">And uh we...uh we didn't know what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="324">Nobody said anything to anybody: where we're going, what's going to happen, where are we heading.</sentence><sentence id="325">We knew we're waiting for something.</sentence><sentence id="326">For a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to take us someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="327">It was not the place where we knew that we were going to stay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="342">So then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> finally arrived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived.</sentence><sentence id="346">It was several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="347">Four, five weeks.</sentence><sentence id="348">I can't recall the exact.</sentence><sentence id="349">And then, we still believed that we were being taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">And this time, instead of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">And they put us in, packed us very tight.</sentence><sentence id="352">And there was hardly <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move.</sentence><sentence id="353">And the whole family there--my grandparents--they were still together.</sentence><sentence id="354">And when they locked the <span class="DLF">door</span>, the click, and put the key on, I knew within me--I wouldn't share it--I knew we were in for something.</sentence><sentence id="355">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="356">And when we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, we could hear the Hungarian guards talking.</sentence><sentence id="357">Even though it was totally locked, we could hear them talking.</sentence><sentence id="358">So we knew we were guarded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> kept travelling.</sentence><sentence id="360">It was maybe a couple of days or so.</sentence><sentence id="361">And then it came to a stop.</sentence><sentence id="362">And we didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="363">Then we heard talking.</sentence><sentence id="364">All of a sudden we heard Hungarian, we heard German talking.</sentence><sentence id="365">And then the Hungarian voices disappeared; and then German guards had taken over.</sentence><sentence id="366">So that put fear in us, knowing that we're not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="367">That this was... And from there on in, it was the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="368">I'd say the beginning of the end, for a lot of people. (</sentence><sentence id="369">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: Now once the Germans took over, what happened then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Then, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> continued.</sentence><sentence id="398">And I think we traveled for another two or three days.</sentence><sentence id="399">I'm not sure the exact amount of time.</sentence><sentence id="400">And I still remember, I could look through the cracks in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">And I didn't know where was heading...we're heading, or where we're going.</sentence><sentence id="402">And I saw people working on damaged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">Uh, there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">And later on, I found out that that's... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was part of where they repaired--<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that were damaged during the war were stripped, used for spare parts.</sentence><sentence id="405">And also I remember seeing these uh...they're sort of balloons, so that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> cannot fly too low.</sentence><sentence id="406">And I had no idea what purpose they were; but there're to prevent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> from flying very far.</sentence><sentence id="407">And later... And I saw that sight.</sentence><sentence id="408">And...and when we arrived, it was like in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="409">It was a nice day.</sentence><sentence id="410">And we were all with anticipation.</sentence><sentence id="411">Where...where are we heading?</sentence><sentence id="412">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> kind of kept slowing down; and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> whistle blowing, slowing down.</sentence><sentence id="413">And then we see barbed wire compound there, and we see these things.</sentence><sentence id="414">And within me, wondering what is this.</sentence><sentence id="415">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="416">I never was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="417">And then, all of a sudden, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a stop.</sentence><sentence id="418">And they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="419">And that was... That's was when I saw <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="420">Pause)</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: That was the first real <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> you saw.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="447">A: That was it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: What happened there?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2055">Q: What happened with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2057">A: Well, uh...when--ironic--when I finished and they sent me out to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, they...uh they made me in charge of the group of the... They gave me in charge of the record.</sentence><sentence id="2058">And I had no idea why, really, I had all those problems from the...from what caused the paralysis.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And since I was in charge of the records, I looked up...I was able to look and see.</sentence><sentence id="2060">They wouldn't tell me why it was.</sentence><sentence id="2061">They just said... And then I learned that it was because of that.</sentence><sentence id="2062">Because I didn't understand yet all this what's going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the mind.</sentence><sentence id="2063">I knew it was from that, but I really did not know the details of it.</sentence><sentence id="2064">So this kind of helped me uh understand myself a little better.</sentence><sentence id="2065">So then, when we got into training and I finished, I was almost a year in communications intelligence; because what they trained us for is to be front line person for the war, to report what's going on for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2066">It was in the Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="2067">And then after I finished training and they sent me to the South for more advanced training; and then they sort of divided up.</sentence><sentence id="2068">Half of us went to Europe, and the other half went to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2069">Fortunately, my name--because it was alphabetical--they took the first half of the alphabet list, they sent to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="2070">So it was a little bit of luck there, because if I had gotten into <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> I would have been sent...

Because I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="2089">They said no.</sentence><sentence id="2090">Uh, then I said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2091">Why don't you just move out, and I want to keep going." "</sentence><sentence id="2092">No."</sentence><sentence id="2093">They took ...
